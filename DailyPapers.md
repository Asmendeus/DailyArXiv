| **[Towards Scalable Braiding: Topological Superconductivity Unlocked under Nearly Arbitrary Magnetic Field Directions in Planar Josephson Junctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20031v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Majorana zero modes (MZM), distinguished by their non-locality and non-Abelian statistics, are central to the pursuit of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Planar Josephson junctions (PJJ) have emerged as a promising platform, offering robust and tunable MZM. However, the perceived sensitivity of topological superconductivity to the magnetic field orientation has posed a major obstacle, particularly for scalable network architectures. Here, we uncover that topological superconductivity in PJJ fundamentally persists under nearly arbitrary in-plane magnetic field directions. The apparent collapse of the global gap under misaligned fields originates not from the destruction of superconductivity itself, but from emergent shifted bulk states from other momentum points, which obscure the gap and MZM. By introducing spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore the global topological gap and recover visible MZM. Remarkably, the spatially modulated PJJs render topological superconductivity robust against maligned fields, thereby enabling MZM survival across complex junction networks and facilitating their braiding. We propose a scalable protocol for MZM braiding and fusion with phase or gate control, opening new routes toward scalable topological quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages and 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tunable Topological Superconductivity by Fully Compensated Ferrimagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19844v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a platform based on a fully compensated ferrimagnet (fFIM) for realizing and controlling topological superconductivity with Majorana bound states across multiple dimensions. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling, we demonstrate that fFIM-based heterostructures host (i) Majorana zero modes localized at the ends of one-dimensional nanowires, (ii) chiral Majorana edge states along two-dimensional boundaries, and (iii) tunable Majorana corner modes in higher-order topological phases. The unique properties of fFIMs enable an electric field to drive topological superconductivity phase transitions and N\'eel vector orientation to control the spatial distribution of Majorana modes, without external magnetic fields. Crucially, the absence of net magnetization in fFIM-based heterostructures preserves superconductivity, circumventing the usual trade-off between tunability and superconducting coherence in magnetized systems. Our results establish fFIM-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for tunable topological superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Advancing Superconducting Qubits: CMOS-Compatible Processing and Room Temperature Characterization for Scalable Quantum Computing beyond 2D Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18173v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on an industry-grade CMOS-compatible qubit fabrication approach using a CMOS pilot line, enabling a yield of functional devices reaching 92.8%, with a resistance spread evaluated across the full wafer 200 mm diameter of 12.4% and relaxation times (T1) approaching 80 us. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wafer-scale room temperature (RT) characteristics collected from multiple wafers and fabrication runs, focusing on RT measurements and their correlation to low temperature qubit parameters. From defined test structures, a across-wafer junction area variation of 10.1% and oxide barrier variation of 7.2% was calculated. Additionally, we notably show a close-correlation between qubit junction resistance and frequency in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation with a critical temperature Tc of about 0.71 K. This overarching relation sets the stage for pre-cooldown qubit evaluation and sorting. In particular, such early-on device characterization and validation are crucial for increasing the fabrication yield and qubit frequency targeting, which currently represent major scaling challenges. Furthermore, it enables the fabrication of large multichip quantum systems in the future. Our findings highlight the great potential of CMOS-compatible industry-style fabrication of superconducting qubits for scalable quantum computing in a foundry pilot line cleanroom.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures.

| **[From local to collective superconductivity in proximitized graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19620v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting proximity effect induces pairing correlations in metallic systems via Andreev scattering. This effect is particularly intriguing in graphene, as it enables two-dimensional superconductivity that is tunable through doping. Understanding how superconducting correlations propagate within the metal is crucial to unveiling the key factors behind this tunability. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the energy and length scales of the proximity effect induced by Pb islands on graphene. Using tip-induced manipulation, we assemble S/N/S junctions with tunable N-region spacing and explore the evolution of the proximitized state in the confined normal region. We find that different doping levels can lead to either localized or collective superconducting states. By combining our experimental results with quasiclassical theory, we demonstrate that interface conductance plays a key role in determining the strength and coherence length of pairing correlations and inter-island coupling. Our findings provide new insights into the design of novel superconducting states and the control of their properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurately Simulating the Time Evolution of an Ising Model with Echo Verified Clifford Data Regression on a Superconducting Quantum Computer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07439v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an error mitigation strategy composed of Echo Verification (EV) and Clifford Data Regression (CDR), the combination of which allows one to learn the effect of the quantum noise channel to extract error mitigated estimates for the expectation value of Pauli observables. We analyse the behaviour of the method under the depolarizing channel and derive an estimator for the depolarization rate in terms of the ancilla purity and postselection probability. We also highlight the sensitivity of this probability to noise, a potential bottleneck for the technique. We subsequently consider a more general noise channel consisting of arbitrary Pauli errors, which reveals a linear relationship between the error rates and the estimation of expectation values, suggesting the learnability of noise in EV by regression techniques. Finally, we present a practical demonstration of Echo Verified Clifford Data Regression (EVCDR) on a superconducting quantum computer and observe accurate results for the time evolution of an Ising model over spin-lattices consisting of up to 35 sites and circuit depths up to 173 entangling layers.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |
| **[$X$-type electrides hosting skin-like interstitial electron states and doping-enhanced superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19263v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of electrides is of great significance for the fundamental physics due to their unique properties arising from interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a novel class of $X$-type electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $O$. Notably, the $X$-type electride characteristic is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced skin-like effect. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering a new pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Sn-Intercalated TaSe$_2$: Structural Diversity Obscured by Conventional Characterization Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19028v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Sn-intercalated TaSe$_2$ as a model system, we uncover structural heterogeneity by single-crystal X-ray diffraction that eludes the common characterization techniques of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical transport measurements. From a single growth composition (1:1:2 Sn:Ta:Se), we obtain diverse stoichiometries and structures, with near-continuous intercalation for Sn$_x$TaSe$_2$ from $0\leq\textrm{x}\leq1$. Using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we identify four new structures: Sn$_{0.18}$TaSe$_{1.92}$ ($R3m$), Sn$_{0.37}$TaSe$_{2.14}$ ($R\bar3$), Sn$_{0.42}$TaSe$_{2.04}$ ($P\bar31c$), and Sn$_{1.1}$TaSe$_2$ ($Fmm2$). In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction cannot resolve all four structures. Raman spectroscopy is unable to distinguish different structures or compositions in the standard measurement range. Transport measurements show consistent superconductivity irrespective of Sn-intercalation amount or appearance of charge density wave behavior. This work underscores the inadequate sensitivity of common approaches in capturing the structural diversity of intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides and the need for high-resolution structural characterization when examining the properties of van der Waals-layered compounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices based on InSb nanoflag Josephson junctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18965v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on InSb nanoflags have recently emerged as an intriguing platform in superconducting electronics. This letter presents the fabrication and investigation of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing InSb nanoflag JJs. We provide measurements of interference patterns in both symmetric and asymmetric geometries. The interference patterns in both configurations can be modulated by a back-gate voltage, a feature well reproduced through numerical simulations. The observed behavior aligns with the skewed current-phase relations of the JJs, demonstrating significant contributions from higher harmonics. We explore the magnetic field response of the devices across a wide range of fields ($\pm 30$ mT), up to the single-junction interference regime, where a Fraunhofer-like pattern is detected. Finally, we assess the flux-to-voltage sensitivity of the SQUIDs to evaluate their performance as magnetometers. A magnetic flux noise of $S^{1/2}_\Phi = 4.4 \times 10^{-6} \Phi_0 / \sqrt{Hz}$ is identified, indicating potential applications in nanoscale magnetometry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in a semiconductor doped with the resonance negative U-centers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18963v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the effect of doping the semiconductor with the resonance negative U-centers upon its superconducting transition temperature. The attraction of electrons at the U-centers leads to the enhancement of transition temperature. On the contrary, the resonant scattering of conduction electrons along with their hybridization at the U-centers results in reducing the transition temperature. The largest effect on the superconducting transition temperature takes place if the resonance width is of the order of the energy level at the U-center. In the lack of the electron-phonon coupling under sufficiently low concentration of U-centers the superconducting transition is entirely absent in spite of the presence of attraction between electrons at U-centers.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Magnetic Dipole Trapping Potential between Infinite Superconducting Plates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18852v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive the exact analytic form of the potential experienced by a magnetic dipole trapped between two infinite parallel superconducting plates using the method of image dipoles, providing a benchmark for numerical methods and a foundation for studying the stability and dynamics of magnetically levitated systems in precision measurements and fundamental physics experiments.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Three-Dimensional Fermi Surface, Van Hove Singularity and Enhancement of Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer Nickelates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18778v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments reveal a three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surface with a clear $k_z$ dispersion in infinite-layer nickelates, distinguishing them from their cuprate superconductor counterparts. However, the impact of this difference on the superconducting properties of nickelates remains unclear. Here, we employ a combined random-phase-approximation and dynamical-mean-field-theory (RPA+DMFT) approach to solve the linearized gap equation for superconductivity. We find that, compared to the cuprate-like two-dimensional (2D) single-orbital Fermi surface, the van Hove singularities on the 3D Fermi surface of infinite-layer nickelates strengthen spin fluctuations by driving the system closer to antiferromagnetic instabilities, thereby significantly enhancing superconductivity. Our findings underscore the critical role of the van Hove singularities in shaping the superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelates and, more broadly, highlight the importance of subtle Fermi surface features in modeling material-specific unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Comment on "Superconductivity and Mott Physics in Organic Charge Transfer Materials"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18531v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Menke et al. recently claimed that superconductivity (SC) in the $\kappa$-phase organic charge-transfer solids (CTS) can be understood within the two-dimensional half-filled anisotropic triangular-lattice Hubbard model. Experimentally, $\kappa$-CTS are mostly but not always antiferromagnetic (AFM) at ambient pressure and SC appears under pressure. In apparent agreement with this observation, Menke et al. found AFM ground states for small $t/U$ and SC over a small region at the interface of AFM and Fermi liquid ground states with increasing $t/U$ at fixed $t'/t$, where $U$ is the Hubbard repulsion. Menke et al's computational results directly contradict those obtained using exact diagonalization and Path Integral Renormalization Group approaches. It is clearly of interest to determine the origin of this discrepancy, especially in view of the facts that (a) related arguments continue to persist in the context of cuprate SC superconductivity (which however involves doping), and (b) there exist CTS in which SC is not proximate to AFM, but is separated by an intermediate charge-disproportionated phase. Here we show that Menke et al's conclusion regarding SC is incorrect and originates from a flawed assumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comment on arXiv:2401.10650 (Phys.

| **[The possible frustrated superconductivity in the kagome superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18336v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric frustration has long been a subject of enduring interest in condensed matter physics. While geometric frustration traditionally focuses on magnetic systems, little attention is paid to the "frustrated superconductivity" which could arise when the superconducting interaction conflicts with the crystal symmetry. The recently discovered kagome superconductors provide a particular opportunity for studying this due to the fact that the frustrated lattice structure and the interference effect between the three sublattices can facilitate the frustrated superconducting interaction. Here, we propose a theory that supports the frustrated superconducting state, derived from the on-site $s$-wave superconducting pairing in conjunction with the nearest-neighbor pairings hoping and the unique geometrical frustrated lattice structure. In this state, whereas the mutual $2\pi/3$ difference of the superconducting pairing phase causes the six-fold modulation of the amplitude and breaks the time-reversal symmetry with $4\pi$ phase changes of the superconducting pairing as one following it around the Fermi surface, it is immune to the impurities without the impurity-induced in-gap states and produces the pronounced Hebel-Slichter peak of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate below $T_{c}$. Notably, the theory also reveals a disorder-induced superconducting pairing transition from the frustrated superconducting state to an isotropic $s$-wave superconducting state without traversing the nodal points, recovering and explaining the behavior found in experiment. This study not only serves as a promising proposal to mediate the divergent or seemingly contradictory experimental outcomes regarding superconducting pairing symmetry, but may also pave the way for advancing investigations into the frustrated superconducting state.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Low crosstalk modular flip-chip architecture for coupled superconducting qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19927v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a flip-chip architecture for an array of coupled superconducting qubits, in which circuit components reside inside individual microwave enclosures. In contrast to other flip-chip approaches, the qubit chips in our architecture are electrically floating, which guarantees a simple, fully modular assembly of capacitively coupled circuit components such as qubit, control, and coupling structures, as well as reduced crosstalk between the components. We validate the concept with a chain of three nearest neighbor coupled generalized flux qubits in which the center qubit acts as a frequency-tunable coupler. Using this coupler, we demonstrate a transverse coupling on/off ratio $\approx$ 50, zz-crosstalk $\approx$ 0.7 kHz between resonant qubits and isolation between the qubit enclosures > 60 dB.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19599v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Combi...</summary><p>Combined Manuscript (17 pages, 5 figures) and Supplemental Information (16 pages, 18 figures and 2 tables)</p></details> |
| **[Eliashberg theory prediction of critical currents in superconducting thin films under DC electric fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17893v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting thin metallic films, functioning as supercurrent gate-tunable transistors, have considerable potential for future quantum electronic devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive microscopic quantitative mechanism that elucidates the control or suppression of supercurrents in thin films remains elusive. Focusing on NbN, a prototypical material, and starting from a phenomenological ansatz that links the critical electric field with the kinetic energy parameter needed to break Cooper pairs, we provide a quantitative analysis of the critical current using Eliashberg theory in the dirty limit without adjustable parameters. The critical kinetic energy value is identified, corresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The peak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy arises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased kinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes sufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is subsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric field required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is in parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations. Although the disorder reduces the temperature dependence of the gating effect on the critical current, at the same time, it increases the unscreened critical electric field needed to suppress superconductivity. This enables the proposal of methods to control and reduce the critical field value necessary to suppress superconductivity in superconducting electronics.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Real-space superconducting properties in the atomically-thin limit: Ab initio approach and its application to Josephson junctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17702v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-space superconducting properties are increasingly important to characterize low-dimensional, layered, and nanostructured materials. Here, we present a method to extract the real-space superconducting order parameter from the superconducting gap spectrum obtained via anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg calculations, using the Bloch wave functions of the Fermi states. We apply this approach to a selection of atomically thin material systems. Our analysis of gallenene, a monolayer of gallium atoms, shows that its planar and buckled phases exhibit distinct superconducting order parameter behaviors, shaped by their structural and electronic properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our real-space approach is exceptionally suited to identify and characterize Josephson junctions made from van der Waals materials. Our examination of a bilayer of NbSe$_2$ reveals that the van der Waals gap acts as an intrinsic weak link between the superconducting NbSe$_2$ layers. Therefore, a bilayer of NbSe$_2$ represents one of the thinnest and most tunable Josephson junction architectures, with potential applications in quantum devices. Our findings underscore the utility of transformation into real-space in understanding superconducting properties through ab initio calculations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence of the logarithmic average phonon frequency in the superconducting critical temperature formula](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17435v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analytically demonstrate the essential role of the logarithmic average phonon frequency in describing the superconducting critical temperature, directly from a predictive function. The current study assumes that the Eliashberg spectral function follows the Debye model in the low frequency spectrum, whereas contributions from optical phonons dominate outside this range. Our findings confirm that, under a specific condition, we obtained a formula for superconducting transition temperature. Furthermore, we compared our formula with the Allen-Dynes formula and its modified version, and the exact solutions. They reveal notable correlations.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14584v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate $La_3Ni_2O_7$ has emerged as a superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_c$) of ~ 80 K above 14 GPa$^{[1-4]}$. Efforts to search for nickelate superconductors with higher $T_c$$^{[5,6]}$, to grow reproducible high-quality single crystals$^{[2,7-10]}$, and to eliminate reliance on demanding high gas pressure synthesis conditions$^{[11]}$, remain significant challenges. Here we report superconductivity up to 92 K under high pressure in single crystals of bilayer nickelates synthesized at ambient pressure using flux methods. High quality $La_2SmNi_2O_{7-{\delta}}$ single crystals with dimensions up to 220 {\mu}m on edge were successfully grown. At ~ 15 GPa, these crystals exhibit superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c^{onset}$) of 68 K and zero-resistance temperature ($T_c^{zero}$) of 47 K. Increasing pressure further enhances both transition temperatures, reaching record values for nickelates: $T_{c,max}^{onset}$ = 92 K and $T_{c,max}^{zero}$ = 73 K @ 21 GPa. Notably, higher $T_c$ correlates with larger in-plane lattice distortion at ambient conditions for bilayer nickelates. Furthermore, we observed a structural transition from monoclinic $P2_1/a$ to tetragonal $I4/mmm$ at ~ 18 GPa, indicating that tetragonal structure is not a prerequisite for superconductivity to appear in this bilayer nickelate. This study provides an easy-to-access method for growing reproducible high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals and offers new insights into achieving higher Tc superconductivity.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Light-driven lattice metastability for enhanced superconductivity in FeSe/SrTiO3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17359v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven quantum materials with on demand properties controlled by external stimuli are critical for emergent quantum technology. In optically tunable superconducting heterostructures, the lattice responses at the buried interface may hold the key to the light susceptibility but is very challenging to detect. In this work, a nondestructive synchrotron-based X-ray scattering phase-retrieval technique is implemented in monolayer-FeSe/SrTiO3 heterostructures to capture the three-dimensional interfacial atomic displacements in-situ as the interface superconductivity is actively manipulated by light. It is found that the interlayer sliding between FeSe and SrTiO3 can drastically alter how the lattice responds to the light. In domains with selected stacking configurations, the interface transforms the very weak photoexcitation in SrTiO3 into significant Fe-atom displacements in FeSe and generate metastable interfacial structures that can lead to a persistent superconductivity enhancement. These findings demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving greatly amplified light-lattice coupling for efficient quantum phase manipulations at designed interfaces.</p></details> |  |

| **[Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19837v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the finite- and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase that survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[$η$-pairing states in the Hubbard model with non-uniform Hubbard interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19786v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existence of $\eta $-pairing eigenstates in the fermionic Hubbard model is fundamentally rooted in the $\eta $-pairing symmetry, which may hold for systems with non-uniform Hubbard interaction $U$. In this work, we present a generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\eta $% -pairing eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that the same quasi-$\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a way of the control of an $\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimer in the Hubbard model. Exact and approximate solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19680v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the tight-binding model taking into account the Coulomb repulsion of electrons at one site (the Hubbard model), an exact calculation of the Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function of the C2 dimer as a structural element of fullerene, the poles of which determine the energy spectrum of the studied nanosystem, was performed. Graphic representations of the equation for the chemical potential and the density of state of electrons were obtained. A solution for the dimer was obtained within the approximation of static fluctuations. The Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function, obtained in the approximation of static fluctuations, coincided with a similar function obtained within the exact solution. The ionization energy and electron affinity were calculated and found to be 11.87 eV and 3.39 eV, respectively. It was concluded that the method for solving the Hubbard model for the C2 dimer in the approximation of static fluctuations proposed in the work can be a fairly adequate method for theoretical study of strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15755v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Hubbard U parameters for Enhanced Description of Electronic and Magnetic Properties in CrI$_3$ Monolayers and Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19357v3)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The magnetic properties of CrI$_3$ monolayers, which were recently measured, have been investigated considering electronic repulsion and localization effects in Cr 3d orbitals. In this study, we propose a DFT approach using Hubbard U corrections to improve accuracy. We compare the valence density-of-states using the HSE06 hybrid functional and the DFT+U approach, which includes U parameters for both Cr 3d and I 5p orbitals. The results of our study indicate that the optimal values for U(Cr$_{3d}$) and U(I$_{5p}$) are 3.5 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. This approach is further applied to improve calculations of electronic and magnetic properties in CrI$_3$ monolayers and, more importantly, in bilayers combined with van der Waals functionals. These refinements hold promise for further studies of complex CrI$_3$ nanostructures, and may also be of interest for other trihalide few-layer systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Universal term of Entanglement Entropy in the $π$-flux Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10602v4)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spin stiffnesses and stability of magnetic order in the lightly doped two-dimensional Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12191v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the density dependence of the spin stiffnesses and the stability of magnetic order with respect to quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model close to half-filling. The stiffnesses are computed from the spin susceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically ordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a moderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a N\'eel antiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a planar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon electron doping, the N\'eel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply. By contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop abruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and then increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite temperatures, the N\'eel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped regime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they vanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe the quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero upon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the quantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains N\'eel ordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range order in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with a spin gap.</p></details> |  |

Starting from the atomic Hamiltonian with no hopping, we generate quasiparticle operators corresponding to holons and doublons in the strongly correlated limit of the repulsive Hubbard model. We develop a real space composite operator formalism using the equation of motion technique to include the intersite hopping perturbatively. Our fully self-consistent calculation stabilizes multiple unidirectional translation symmetry broken states within the doping range $\delta=0.07$ to $0.2$. The charge-ordered states become increasingly unfavorable with hole-doping. The unidirectional density waves manifest as periodic modulations of half-filled Mott regions separated by hole-rich regions. Notably, density wave solutions with periods of $3$ to $8$ lattice spacing remain energetically higher than those with larger periods. Quenched disorder on the charge-ordered states induces the merging of the Mott regions and, consequently, forms short-ranged charge modulations. The density of states shows signatures of strongly correlated Mott regions, potentially relevant to the physics of underdoped cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data files for initial guesses and converged solutions are provided as ancillary files.

A paradigmatic model for such materials that captures both kinds of interactions is the two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model with a dispersionless Einstein phonon. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the magnetic, density, and superconducting fluctuations at and away from half-filling. To that end, we employ the functional renormalization group using the recently introduced extension of the single-boson exchange formulation. More precisely, we go beyond previous approaches to the model by resolving the full frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex and taking into account the feedback from the electronic self-energy. We perform broad parameter scans in the space of Hubbard repulsion, electron-phonon coupling strength, and phonon frequency to explore the leading magnetic, density, and superconducting susceptibilities from the adiabatic to the anti-adiabatic regime. Our numerical data reveal that self-energy effects lead to an enhancement of the $d$-wave superconducting susceptibility towards larger phonon frequencies, in contrast to earlier isotope-effect studies. At small phonon frequencies, large density contributions to the $s$-wave superconducting susceptibility change sign and eventually lead to a reduction of $s$-wave superconductivity with increasing electron-phonon coupling, signaling the breakdown of Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We analyze our findings systematically, employing detailed diagnostics of the intertwined fluctuations and pinning down the various positive and negative isotope effects of the physical susceptibilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 24 figures; comments welcome</p></details> |

This phenomenon, occurring at half-filling, is influenced by the quantum phase transition between the alternating pair (AP) and paramagnetic (PM) phases at zero temperature. In this study, we leverage this anomalous behavior to investigate the performance of quantum many-body machines, using the EHM as the working substance. Our analysis reveals that the quantum Otto engine, when operating in the anomalous region, closely mimics the ideal Carnot engine. In this region, both the work output and thermal efficiency of the Otto engine increase, approaching the performance of a Carnot engine. This highlights the potential of many-body systems, such as the EHM, in enhancing quantum thermodynamic performance. Our findings demonstrate that, although the second law of thermodynamics prevents engines from surpassing Carnot efficiency, the Otto engine can operate remarkably close to this limit in the anomalous region, offering insights into new directions for future research on quantum thermodynamic cycles and working substances.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

In addition to the expected renormalization to the band structure, we find that the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction produces an anomalous spectral feature when electrons are added in the singlet channel but which is absent in the triplet channel. By comparing these results with those obtained from perturbation theory in the antiadiabatic limit, we demonstrate that this anomalous feature is a remnant of the strong electron-electron interaction mediated by the SSH coupling previously derived in the two-particle limit. By studying the evolution of this feature as a function of doping, we track the fate of this attraction to higher carrier concentrations and provide predictions for the spectral features to help guide future searches for strong e-ph mediated pairing.</p></details> | 7 figures |

Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations with a large number of states, we convincingly demonstrate the development of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) characterized by infinite-length stripes along the primitive vector of square lattice in models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'=-0.1\sim -0.3$ and doping $\delta \sim 14\%$. Intriguingly, analysis of pair-pair correlation functions along these stripes reveals incommensurate pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity with diverged susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of dominant PDW in the single-band Hubbard model on square lattices. At lower doping $\delta \sim 10\%$, we observed the formation of an additional CDW order within each stripe, which aligns across different stripes, forming a holon Wigner crystal phase. The spin pattern retains antiferromagnetic stripes with anti-phase domain walls. The ordering momentum of this emerged CDW order is remarkably close to the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs in the PDW phase, suggesting a multifaceted relationship between CDW and PDW ordering.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures + supplemental material</p></details> |

Accumulation of the resulting defects gives rise to the evolution in the micro-structure of the fuel which in turn brings about local tensions and strains in the fuel. One of the after effects due to evolution of micro-structure is the swelling of fuel which can damage the fuel cladding and cause environmental contamination by leakage of radioactive particles. Hence, it is vital to continually monitor the evolution of micro-structure and to analyze the changes in mechanical properties of the fuel. The study of elastic constants and analysis of their behavior is very helpful in understanding the mechanical properties of the fuel. In this research, using the Hubbard-corrected first-principles density-functional theory method, we have calculated the elastic constants of the uranium dioxide single crystal and compared the results with existing experimental data. In addition, using the Voigt, Reuss, and Hill models, we have estimated the mechanical properties for the poly-crystalline fresh fuel. The results show a very good agreement between the theory and experiment. Accordingly, we can reliably extend our method of calculations to the complicated system of irradiated fuel pellet, which is in the form of a poly-crystal and hosts various defects.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

This is a three-dimensional generalization of a similar mapping of the two-dimensional quantum Hall plateau transition to a one-dimensional Hubbard chain. We demonstrate that this mapping leads to the conclusion that the Weyl semimetal becomes a diffusive metal with a nonzero density of states at arbitrarily weak disorder, in agreement with recent work. We also discuss the absence of localization in strongly disordered Weyl semimetals from the viewpoint of this mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, published version</p></details> |

We then generalize it beyond square lattice and on-site Hubbard interactions and achieve better scaling in the number of sites within a unit cell, while there is substantial increase when there are more types of interactions.

In semiconductors, it drives the Rashba spin splitting and spin momentum locking, while in magnetic insulators based on transition metals, it induces anisotropic spin exchange interactions, like Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which drive chiral magnetism and skyrmion formation. Here, we establish a direct connection between SOC and spin exchange interactions by deriving an effective spin model from the SOC Hubbard model at half-filling. Using a strong-coupling expansion up to fourth order, we identify Heisenberg, Ising-like, and ring exchange interactions, as well as a variety of four-body terms for realistic Hubbard parameters. These parameters constrain the relative strengths of spin interactions, providing a natural interpolation between metallic and insulating phases that host complex magnetic textures.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasi-particle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states and the associated onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ scattering may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity in the cuprates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard test for this purpose, which requires an implementation of controlled single-particle fermionic operators. However, for a number of locality-preserving mappings to encode fermions into qubits, a direct construction of such operators is not possible. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm, which uses an analog of the Kubo formula adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly using only bilinears of fermionic operators and circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We test our new algorithm in practice by using open-access simulators of noisy IBM superconducting chips.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 29 figures, 4 tables, includes appendix</p></details> |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |

However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions.

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance SC within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens SC by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens SC. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional SC of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital.

Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity.

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, achieving superconductivity in this system currently requires relatively high pressures. In this study, we propose a chemical pressure strategy via Sr substitution to stabilize high-Tc superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient conditions.Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1) at ambient pressure and identify two dynamically stable phases:La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$.Our calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallization of the $\sigma$-bonding bands dominated by Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals-a key feature associated with high-Tc superconductivity, as reported in the high-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Further analysis using tight-binding models shows that the key hopping parameters in La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$ closely resemble those of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, indicating that strong super-exchange interactions between interlayer Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals are preserved. These findings suggest that Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a promising candidate for realizing high-Tcsuperconductivity at ambient pressure.</p></details> |  |

The La(2)$_{\rm a}$ site of the ideal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ is clearly distinguished from the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site close to the local defects. Below 150K, almost half of the intrinsic La(2)$_{\rm a}$ sites are dominated by a finite internal field within the $ab$ plane, while the other half are dominated by zero internal field. The result is fully consistent with the single spin-spinless stripe order of ($\cdots\uparrow\circ\downarrow\circ\uparrow\circ\cdots$), where the reduced Ni magnetic moments are parallel to the $ab$-plane. Even for the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site, the result is also explained within the same model by considering the inhomogeneous internal magnetic fields enhanced around the nearby defects such as oxygen vacancies. These findings provide unambiguous microscopic evidence for the single spin-spinless stripe order below 150 K at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility via Fermi surface nesting, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML in our zero- and finite-temperature calculations. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

DFT+U calculations reveal that the A-type antiferromagnetic ground state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ persists throughout the studied pressure range. Electronic structure analysis shows that the Ni-$d_{xy}$ and Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level in both the $Fmmm$ and $Amam$ phases of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Phonon dispersion calculations for the $Fmmm$ phase reveal no imaginary modes from 12 to 29.5 GPa, confirming its dynamical stability in this pressure range. The vibrational frequencies of O atoms are substantially higher than those of Ni and La atoms, primarily due to the lower mass of oxygen. At 29.5 GPa, the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ for the $Fmmm$ phase is calculated to be 0.13. This small value suggests that conventional electron-phonon coupling is insufficient to explain the reported superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, indicating a potentially unconventional mechanism. The study offers nuanced, actionable insights that can strategically inform and direct subsequent experimental investigations into the design and optimization of nickel-based superconducting materials.</p></details> |  |

However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cell has significantly limited spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of the density waves and their interplay with superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that both the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are initially suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa. After the density wave collapse, a newly small charge gap associated to superconductivity opens at low temperatures. The extracted gap-to-T$_c$ ratio, $2\Delta_{SC}/ k_{B} T_{c} $, is found to be approximately 3, consistent with the weak coupling regime. These results suggest that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the layered nickelate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ with hybrid single-layer and bilayer stacking showed superconductivity under high pressure. This compound combines features of La$_2$NiO$_4$ and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but its pairing mechanism remains to be understood. Motivated by this finding, here we report a comprehensive theoretical study of this system. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the undistorted P4/mmm phase without pressure is unstable due to three distortion modes. Increasing pressure suppresses these modes and causes ``charge transfer'' between the single-layer and bilayer sublattices, leading to hole-doping in the single-layer blocks. Our random-phase approximation calculations indicate a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that arises from spin-fluctuation scattering between Fermi surface states mainly originating from the single-layer blocks and additional weaker contributions from the bilayer blocks. These spin-fluctuations could be detected by inelastic neutron scattering as a strong peak at ${\bf q}=(\pi, \pi)$. Our findings distinguish La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ from other nickelate superconductors discovered so far and the high-$T_c$ cuprates. We also discuss both similarities and differences between La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ and other hybrid stacking nickelates.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Microscopic insights into magnetism, which emerges near superconductivity, require a synergistic approach that combines complementary techniques with controlled parameter tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), resistivity, and specific heat measurements. At ambient pressure, two incommensurate spin density wave (SDW) transitions were identified at $T_{\rm SDW} \simeq 132$ K and $T^\ast \simeq 90$ K. NPD experiments revealed that the magnetic wave vector $(0, 0.574, 0)$ remains unchanged below 130 K, indicating that the transition at $T^\ast$ corresponds to a reorientation of the Ni magnetic moments within a similar magnetic structure. Comparison of the observed internal magnetic fields with dipole-field calculations reveals a magnetic structure consistent with an antiferromagnetically coupled SDW on the outer two Ni layers, with smaller moments on the inner Ni layer. The internal fields at muon stopping sites appeared abruptly at $T_{\rm SDW}$, suggesting a first-order-like nature of the SDW transition, which is closely linked to the charge density wave (CDW) order occurring at the same temperature ($T_{\rm SDW} = T_{\rm CDW}$). Under applied pressure, all transition temperatures, including $T_{\rm SDW}$, $T^\ast$, and $T_{\rm CDW}$, were suppressed at a nearly uniform rate of $\simeq -13$ K/GPa. This behavior contrasts with the double-layer RP nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where pressure enhances the separation of the density wave transitions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

This discovery of new family of high-temperature superconductors has garnered significant attention in the condensed matter physics community. In this work, we assume the this high-temperature superconductor is mediated by phonons and investigate the pairing symmetry in two distinct models: (i) the full-coupling case, where the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals are treated equally in both interlayer and intralayer coupling interactions, and (ii) the half-coupling case, where the intralayer coupling involves only the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, while the interlayer coupling is restricted to the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital. Our calculations reveal that the interlayer coupling favors an $s\pm$-wave superconducting state, whereas the intralayer coupling promotes an $s++$-wave symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications of pair-hopping interactions on the superconducting properties. These findings provide valuable insights into the pairing mechanisms and symmetry of this newly discovered high-temperature superconductor.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Accompanying the superconductivity and a correlated insulator phase is the Kondo-lattice-like phenomenology in transport properties. Here we consider how such phenomenology can develop when the combination of the active bands are topological. We advance a unique construction of compact molecular orbitals through a partial Wannierization that is symmetry preserving. The resulting Anderson lattice model provides the basis for a microscopic understanding of the experimental observation, including the involved energy scales.

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11763v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band's natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters; 7 + 9 pages, 4 + 6 figures</p></details> |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to $2.2\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for SnSe$_2$ and up to $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for WSe$_2$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Schottky-barrier-height in high-symmetry 2D WSe$_2$: Momentum-space anisotropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11005v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is usually supposed that only low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit anisotropy, here we show that high-symmetry 2D semiconductors can show significant anisotropy in momentum space due to the band structure anisotropy in k-space. The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04131v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrupolar Excitons in MoSe$_2$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18040v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for platforms to generate and control exotic excitonic states has greatly benefited from the advent of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their heterostructures. Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript just accepted in Nature Communications.

| **[Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03361v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-valley polarization control in WSe$_2$ monolayers using photochemical doping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03049v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</p></details> |  |

We characterize the junction by measurements of the magnetic field induced interference pattern, and the AC Josephson effect manifested as "Shapiro steps", examining current dependent hysteresis and junction dynamics. The latter can be tuned by temperature, gate voltage, and magnetic field. Finally, we examine the evolution of the supercurrent when subjected to in-plane magnetic fields. Notably, we observe a strong anisotropy in the supercurrent with respect to the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field. When the field is parallel to the current direction, the supercurrent is suppressed, and shows revivals with increasing magnetic field, whereas it remains almost unaffected when the field is oriented in a perpendicular direction. We suggest that this anisotropy is caused by the dependence of supercurrent interference on the junction geometry.</p></details> |  |

This effect is particularly intriguing in graphene, as it enables two-dimensional superconductivity that is tunable through doping. Understanding how superconducting correlations propagate within the metal is crucial to unveiling the key factors behind this tunability. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the energy and length scales of the proximity effect induced by Pb islands on graphene. Using tip-induced manipulation, we assemble S/N/S junctions with tunable N-region spacing and explore the evolution of the proximitized state in the confined normal region. We find that different doping levels can lead to either localized or collective superconducting states. By combining our experimental results with quasiclassical theory, we demonstrate that interface conductance plays a key role in determining the strength and coherence length of pairing correlations and inter-island coupling. Our findings provide new insights into the design of novel superconducting states and the control of their properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Valley Degeneracy on Thermoelectric Properties of Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons with Staggered Sublattice Potentials and Transverse Electric Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11285v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the band inversion of flat bands in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a tight-binding model. The band inversion results from symmetry breaking in the transverse direction, achievable through deposition on specific substrates such as separated silicon carbide or hexagonal boron nitride sheets. Upon band inversion, ZGNRs exhibit electronic structures characterized by valley degeneracy and band gap properties, which can be modulated by transverse electric fields. To explore the impact of this level degeneracy on thermoelectric properties, we employ Green's function techniques to calculate thermoelectric quantities in ZGNR segments with staggered sublattice potentials and transverse electric fields. Two carrier transport scenarios are considered: the chemical potential is positioned above and below the highest occupied molecular orbital. We analyze thermionic-assisted transport (TAT) and direct ballistic transport (DBT). Level degeneracy enhances the electric power factors of ZGNRs by increasing electrical conductance, while the Seebeck coefficient remains robust in the TAT scenario. Conversely, in DBT, the enhancement of the power factor primarily stems from improvements in the Seebeck coefficient at elevated temperatures.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages and 12 figures</p></details> |

Its overarching aim is to provide a fundamental understanding of spin-dependent phenomena in solid-state systems that can enable a new generation of spin-based logic devices. Over the past decade, graphene and related 2D van der Waals crystals have taken center stage in expanding the scope and potential of spintronic materials. Their distinctive electronic properties and atomically thin nature have opened new opportunities to probe and manipulate internal electronic degrees of freedom. Purely electrical control over conduction-electron spins can be attained in graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, due to proximity effects combined with graphene's high electronic mobility. Specifically, graphene experiences a proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient spin-charge interconversion processes; the two most well-known and at the forefront of current research are the spin Hall and inverse spin galvanic effects, wherein an electrical current yields a spin current and non-equilibrium spin polarization, respectively. This article provides an overview of the basic principles, theory, and experimental methods underpinning the nascent field of 2D material-based spintronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 9 figures.

We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.~Atiyah and R.~Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |

Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18962v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expression of chirality in adsorption phenomena constitutes an important topic, not only relevant to asymmetric transformations involving solid surfaces, but also to the emergence of homochirality in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial scenarios. Methanol (MeOH) aggregation on graphite/graphene, one of the most idealized adsorbate-adsorbent systems, lead to islands of cyclic clusters of different sizes (Nano. Lett., 2016, 16, 3142-3147). Here, we show that this aggregation occurs enantioselectively affording 2D conglomerates depending on the size of clusters, in close analogy to a Pasteurian racemate. Homochiral sequences are held together by hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions, whose absolute configurations can be appropriately specified. A discussion involving the dichotomy between 2D racemates and conglomerates, is offered as well. In addition, the present simulations showcase a broad range of acyclic and cyclic structures, even if some discrete rings are the dominant species, in agreement with previous experimental data and theoretical modeling. Our results indicate that MeOH clusters show binding energies close to the experimental values, remaining intact at temperatures as high as 120 K and up to 150 K.</p></details> |  |
| **[Micro-tip manipulated origami for robust twisted few-layer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18869v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twisted few-layer graphene (tFLG) has emerged as an ideal model system for investigating novel strongly correlated and topological phenomena. However, the experimental construction of tFLG with high structural stability is still challenging. Here, we introduce a highly accessible method for fabricating robust tFLG by polymer micro-tip manipulated origami. Through using a self-prepared polymer micro-tip, which is composed of multiple dimethylpolysiloxane, poly(vinyl chloride), and graphite sheets, to fold graphene layers, we fabricated tFLG with different twist angles (0{\deg}-30{\deg}) and various layers, including twisted bilayers (1+1), twisted double-bilayers (2+2), twisted double-trilayers (3+3), and thicker layers. Even ABC-stacked tFLG were created, such as twisted ABC/ABC and ABC/ABA graphene coexisting in an ABC-ABA domain wall region. We found that the origami-fabricated tFLG exhibits high stability against thermal and mechanical perturbations including heating and transferring, which could be attributed to its special folding and tearing structures. Moreover, based on the rich types of samples, we revealed twist-angle and stacking-order dependent Raman characteristics of tFLG, which is valuable for understanding the stacking-modulated phonon spectroscopy. Our experiments provide a simple and efficient approach to construct structurally robust tFLG, paving the way for the study of highly stable twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18753v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen-doped GNRs (O-doped chevron-GNR and O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O-doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron-GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)-GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)-GNR, the band structure of O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2-hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)-GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, first-principles simulations are used to calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of heterostructures composed of Graphene and MoS$_2$ considering the influence of point defects and Vanadium doping. It is found that the concentration of the dopants and the types of defects can result in induced magnetic moments leading to ferromagnetically polarized systems with sharp interfaces. This provides a framework for interpreting the experimental observations of enhanced ferromagnetism in both MoS$_2$/Graphene and V-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene heterostructures. The computed electronic and spin polarizations give a microscopic understanding of the origin of ferromagnetism in these systems and illustrate how doping and defect engineering can lead to targeted property tunability. Our work has demonstrated that through defects engineering, ferromagnetism can be achieved in V-doped MoS$_2$/Graphene heterostructures, providing a potential way to induce magnetization in other TMDC/Graphene materials and opening new opportunities for their applications in nano-spintronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 pages, 1 table.

| **[Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02670v5)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Physical Review X which emphasizes: discrepancy between theoretical and experimental onsite U; emergent f-electron potential phenomenologically introduced to model the chemical potential resets; auxiliary rotor mean-field method to capture the normal state physics; and two temperature scales in the system due to two competing fixed points. 18+7 pages, 23+3 figures</p></details> |

Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule.

Here, the resonant Raman scattering will be utilized to study an exciton-phonon interaction in GaN nanocrystals, further enhanced by the underlying graphene. Raman spectroscopy using various excitation energies shows how the exciton-phonon interaction behaves, unveiling the scattering strength. The origin of the interaction is in the condition of resonance, which is directly observed in the temperature resolved spectra. Most importantly, the underlying graphene strongly enhances the coupling of phonons and excitons. Consequently, an enhanced resonant Raman spectrum of GaN nanocrystals possessing clearly observable phonon overtones up to the 4th order has been obtained. It has been demonstrated that the responsible effect is the electron transfer between nanocrystals and the underlying graphene. The utilization of such an increased coupling effect can be beneficial for a study of the charge carrier scattering in semiconducting nanomaterials, analysis of their crystal quality, improvement of sensor sensitivity and in the subsequent development of new-generation optoelectronic devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electric-field independent spin-orbit coupling gap in hBN-encapsulated bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18122v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in bilayer graphene (BLG) is essential for encoding spin qubits while bringing technical challenges for extracting the opened small SOC gap {\Delta}_SO in experiments. Moreover, in addition to the intrinsic Kane-Mele term, extrinsic mechanisms also contribute to SOC in BLG, especially under experimental conditions including encapsulation of BLG with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and applying an external out-of-plane electric displacement field D. Although measurements of {\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated BLG have been reported, the relatively large experimental variations and existing experimental controversy make it difficult to fully understand the physical origin of {\Delta}_SO. Here, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on {\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated BLG. We use an averaging method to extract {\Delta}_SO in gate-defined single quantum dot devices. Under D fields as large as 0.57-0.90 V/nm, {\Delta}_SO=53.4-61.8 {\mu}eV is obtained from two devices. Benchmarked with values reported at lower D field regime, our results support a D field-independent {\Delta}_SO. This behavior is confirmed by our first-principle calculations, based on which {\Delta}_SO is found to be independent of D field, regardless of different hBN/BLG/hBN stacking configurations. Our calculations also suggest a weak proximity effect from hBN, indicating that SOC in hBN-encapsulated BLG is dominated by the intrinsic Kane-Mele mechanism. Our results offer insightful understandings of SOC in BLG, which benefit SOC engineering and spin manipulations in BLG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nanoscale infrared and microwave imaging of stacking faults in multilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17783v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphite occurs in a range of metastable stacking orders characterized by both the number and direction of shifts between adjacent layers by the length of a single carbon-carbon bond. At the extremes are Bernal (or ``ABAB...'') stacking, where the direction of the interlayer shift alternates with each layer, and rhombohedral (or ``ABCABC...'') stacking order where the shifts are always in the same direction. However, for an N-layer system, there are in principle $N-1$ unique metastable stacking orders of this type. Recently, it has become clear that stacking order has a strong effect on the low energy electronic band structure with single-layer shifts completely altering the electronic properties. Most experimental work has focused on the extremal stacking orders in large part due to the difficulty of isolating and identifying intermediate orders. Motivated by this challenge, here we describe two atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques to unambiguously distinguish stacking orders and defects in graphite flakes. Photo-thermal infrared atomic force microscope (AFM-IR) is able to distinguish stacking orders across multiple IR wavelengths and readily provides absolute contrast via IR spectral analysis. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) can distinguish the relative contrast between Bernal, intermediate and rhombohedral domains. We show that both techniques are well suited to characterizing graphite van der Waals devices, providing high contrast determination of stacking order, subsurface imaging of graphene flakes buried under a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) dielectric layer, and identifying nanoscale domain walls. Our results pave the way for the reliable fabrication of graphene multilayer devices of definite interlayer registry.</p></details> |  |

This could be achieved, for example, by growing the graphene layer on top of a transition metal dichalcogenide, such as WS$_2$. Here, we focus on the ballistic, wide, and short junction limits and study the effects of the spin-orbit interaction on the supercurrent. In particular, we analyze the current phase relation using an analytical approach based on the continuum model. We find combinations of types of spin-orbit coupling that significantly suppress the supercurrent by opening a gap in the graphene band structure. At the same time, other combinations enhance it, acting as an effective spin-valley resolved chemical potential. Moreover, we find that a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling leads to a junction with a highly voltage tunable harmonic content.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Optimizing thermoelectric performance of graphene antidot lattices via quantum transport and machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17450v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermoelectric materials, which can convert waste heat to electricity or be utilized as solid-state coolers, hold promise for sustainable energy applications. However, optimizing thermoelectric performance remains a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between electronic and thermal transport properties. In this work, we systematically optimize $ZT$ in graphene antidot lattices (GALs), nanostructured graphene sheets with periodic nanopores characterized by two geometric parameters: the hexagonal unit cell side length $L$ and the antidot radius $R$. The lattice thermal conductivity is determined through machine-learned potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, while electronic transport properties are computed using linear-scaling quantum transport in combination with MD trajectories based on a bond-length-dependent tight-binding model. This method is able to account for electron-phonon scattering, allowing access to diffusive transport in large-scale systems, overcoming limitations of previous methods based on nonequilibrium Green function formalism. Our results show that the introduction of the antidots effectively decouples lattice and electronic transport and lead to a favorable and significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. We find that optimal $ZT$ values occur in GALs with intermediate $L$ and $R$, closely correlated with peak power factor values. Notably, thermoelectric performance peaks near room temperature, with maximal $ZT$ values approaching 2, highlighting GALs as promising candidates for high-performance thermoelectric energy conversion.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Without loss of generality, we show that the density of states and the twist angle set an upper bound for this response, which is inversely proportional to the square of the twist angle. For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order $10^4~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order $10^5~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moir\'e heterostructures.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Tunable Inter-Edge Interactions in a Bilayer Graphene Quantum Hall Antidot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16750v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic interferometers in the quantum Hall regime are one of the best tools to study the statistical properties of localized quasiparticles in the topologically protected bulk. However, since their behavior is probed via chiral edge modes, bulk-to-edge and inter-edge interactions are two important effects that affect the observations. Moreover, almost all kinds of interferometers heavily rely on a pair of high-quality quantum point contacts where the presence of impurities significantly modifies the behavior of such constrictions, which in turn can alter the outcome of the measurements. Antidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional geometries and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through simple conductance measurements, replacing the need for complex techniques such as shot noise. Here, we use a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot, operated in the Coulomb-dominated regime. By varying the antidot potential, we can tune inter-edge interactions, enabling a crossover from a single-dot to a double-dot behavior. In the latter, strong coupling between the two edge states leads to edge-state pairing, resulting in a measured doubling of the tunneling charge. We find that in certain regimes, the inter-edge coupling completely dominates over other energy scales of the system, overshadowing the interference effects these devices are mainly designed to probe. These results highlight the significant role of inter-edge interactions and establish antidots as a versatile platform for exploring quantum Hall interferometry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gapfull and gapless $1$D Topological Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16176v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thermal rectification and phonon properties in partially perforated graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16013v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, a thermal rectification ratio $\eta$ of 18.5% was observed in partially perforated graphene with the use of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. In all cases studied here, heat preferentially flows from the porous to the pristine region and both $\kappa$ and $\eta$ increase upon increasing the length of the pristine region and upon decreasing the size of the pores. To interpret the results, the macroscopic "R-Series Model" is applied, attributing rectification to the different temperature dependence of $\kappa$ of perforated and pristine graphene. According to the model, $\eta$ is maximized when the two regions composing the structure have matching thermal resistances and mismatching temperature-dependence of $\kappa$. The model agrees qualitatively with the MD results, indicating that the latter is the principal rectification mechanism, but it can significantly underestimate $\eta$. Phonon analysis further reveals the appearance of new 'defect' modes localized around and between pores, resulting in the emergence of a new prominent peak in the phonon Density of States at 520 $cm^{-1}$. The study considers key geometric factors such as the length of the pristine region, and the pore size, shape, alignment, and orientation. Pore shape and alignment exert minimal influence on $\eta$, although alignment greatly influences $\kappa$. Eventually, arranged pores are deemed more efficient than randomly distributed defects for increasing rectification.</p></details> |  |

| **[Approximate Quantum Compiling for Quantum Simulation: A Tensor Network based approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08609v7)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AQCtensor, a novel algorithm to produce short-depth quantum circuits from Matrix Product States (MPS). Our approach is specifically tailored to the preparation of quantum states generated from the time evolution of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. This tailored approach has two clear advantages over previous algorithms that were designed to map a generic MPS to a quantum circuit. First, we optimize all parameters of a parametric circuit at once using Approximate Quantum Compiling (AQC) - this is to be contrasted with other approaches based on locally optimizing a subset of circuit parameters and "sweeping" across the system. We introduce an optimization scheme to avoid the so-called ``orthogonality catastrophe" - i.e. the fact that the fidelity of two arbitrary quantum states decays exponentially with the number of qubits - that would otherwise render a global optimization of the circuit impractical. Second, the depth of our parametric circuit is constant in the number of qubits for a fixed simulation time and fixed error tolerance. This is to be contrasted with the linear circuit Ansatz used in generic algorithms whose depth scales linearly in the number of qubits. For simulation problems on 100 qubits, we show that AQCtensor thus achieves at least an order of magnitude reduction in the depth of the resulting optimized circuit, as compared with the best generic MPS to quantum circuit algorithms. We demonstrate our approach on simulation problems on Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians on up to 100 qubits and find optimized quantum circuits that have significantly reduced depth as compared to standard Trotterized circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classical simulation of parity-preserving quantum circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19317v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a classical simulation method for fermionic quantum systems which, without loss of generality, can be represented by parity-preserving circuits made of two-qubit gates in a brick-wall structure. We map such circuits to a fermionic tensor network and introduce a novel decomposition of non-Matchgate gates into a Gaussian fermionic tensor and a residual quartic term, inspired by interacting fermionic systems. The quartic term is independent of the specific gate, which allows us to precompute intermediate results independently of the exact circuit structure and leads to significant speedups when compared to other methods. Our decomposition suggests a natural perturbative expansion which can be turned into an algorithm to compute measurement outcomes and observables to finite accuracy when truncating at some order of the expansion. For particle number conserving gates, our decomposition features a unique truncation cutoff reducing the computational effort for high precision calculations. Our algorithm significantly lowers resource requirements for simulating parity-preserving circuits while retaining high accuracy, making it suitable for simulations of interacting systems in quantum chemistry and material science. Lastly, we discuss how our algorithm compares to other classical simulation methods for fermionic quantum systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Quantum-Enhanced LLM Efficient Fine Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12790v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models through low-rank matrix approximation, achieving effectiveness in many scenarios. However, its representation capacity is constrained in complex tasks or high-rank dependency settings, potentially limiting model adaptability. To overcome the expressive bottleneck in classical low-rank approximation for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), we propose Quantum Tensor Hybrid Adaptation (QTHA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that integrates a quantum neural network (QNN) with a tensor network. QTHA explores quantum tensor hybrid fine-tuning within low-rank spaces by decomposing pre-trained weights into quantum neural network and tensor network representations, leveraging quantum state superposition to overcome classical rank limitations. Experiments demonstrate that QTHA achieves performance comparable to or surpassing LoRA in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, QTHA reduces trainable parameters by 76% while reducing training loss by up to 17% and improving test set performance by up to 17% within the same training steps. This research not only enables lightweight adaptation of quantum resources to the billion-parameter models but also validates the feasibility of quantum hardware optimization driven by LLM tasks. It establishes the first engineering-ready foundation for future quantum-enhanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cons-training Tensor Networks: Embedding and Optimization Over Discrete Linear Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09005v4)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variationally optimizing infinite projected entangled-pair states at large bond dimensions: A split corner transfer matrix renormalization group approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10298v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison against quantum and classical Ising machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16431v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16+7 ...</summary><p>16+7 pages, 12+7 figures</p></details> |

Our investigation proves that MPS rival traditional deep learning models such as autoencoders and GANs in terms of performance, while providing much richer model interpretability. Our approach naturally facilitates the extraction of feature-wise probabilities, Von Neumann Entropy, and mutual information, offering a compelling narrative for classification of anomalies and fostering an unprecedented level of transparency and interpretability, something fundamental to understand the rationale behind artificial intelligence decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Locally Purified Density Operators for Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Mixed States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16978v3)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a tensor network approach known as the locally purified density operator (LPDO) to investigate the classification and characterization of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in open quantum systems. We extend the concept of injectivity, originally associated with matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, to LPDOs in $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems, unveiling two distinct types of injectivity conditions inherent in short-range entangled density matrices. Within the LPDO framework, we outline a classification scheme for decohered average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases, consistent with earlier results obtained through spectrum sequence techniques. We first illustrate our framework with ASPT phases protected by fermion parity symmetry, then extend the classification of ASPT phases to a general group extension. We demonstrate examples of explicit construction of fixed-point LPDOs for ASPT phases including intrinsic ASPTs in both $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32+4 ...</summary><p>32+4 pages, 6 figures, to appear in Physical Review X</p></details> |
| **[Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00497v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a method that generates ground-state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of local observables and correlation functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Randomness through Emergent Confinement Mechanism in Measured Tensor Network States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16995v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomness is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, arising from the measurement process that collapses superpositions into definite outcomes according to Born's rule. Generating large-scale random quantum states is crucial for quantum computing and many-body physics, yet remains a key challenge. We present a practical method based on local measurements of random Tensor Networks, focusing on random Matrix Product States (MPS) generated by two distinct quantum circuit architectures, both feasible on near-term devices. We certify the emergent quantum randomness using the frame potential and establish a mapping between its behavior and the statistical mechanics of a domain wall particle model. In both architectures, the effect of quantum measurements induces a nontrivial confinement mechanism, where domain walls are either trapped by an external potential or bound in pairs to form meson-like excitations. Our results, supported by both exact analytical calculations and numerical simulations, suggest that confinement is a general mechanism underlying random state generation in broader settings with local measurements, including quantum circuits and chaotic dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating Quantum Circuits with Tree Tensor Networks using Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16718v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). To benchmark the method, we simulate random and QAOA circuits with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that TTNs provide a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.</p></details> | 11 pages, 13 figures |

The complexity of noisy quantum systems is even greater, requiring $2^n \times 2^n$-dimensional density matrices. Various approximations reduce density matrix overhead, including quantum trajectory-based methods, which instead use an ensemble of $m \ll 2^n$ noisy states. While this method is dramatically more efficient, current implementations use unoptimized sampling, redundant state preparation, and single-shot data collection. In this manuscript, we present the Pre-Trajectory Sampling technique, increasing the efficiency and utility of trajectory simulations by tailoring error types, batching sampling without redundant computation, and collecting error information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both a mature statevector simulation of a 35-qubit quantum error-correction code and a preliminary tensor network simulation of 85 qubits, yielding speedups of up to $10^6$x and $16$x, as well as generating massive datasets of one trillion and one million shots, respectively.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Kronecker states: a powerful source of multipartite maximally entangled states in quantum information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16256v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In quantum information theory, maximally entangled states, specifically locally maximally entangled (LME) states, are essential for quantum protocols. While many focus on bipartite entanglement, applications such as quantum error correction and multiparty secret sharing rely on multipartite entanglement. These LME states naturally appear in the invariant subspaces of tensor products of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$, called Kronecker subspaces, whose dimensions are the Kronecker coefficients. A Kronecker subspace is a space of multipartite LME states that entangle high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Although these states can be derived from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $S_n$, known methods are inefficient even for small $n$. A quantum-information-based alternative comes from entanglement concentration protocols, where Kronecker subspaces arise in the isotypic decomposition of multiple copies of entangled states. Closed forms have been found for the multiqubit $W$-class states, but not in general. This thesis extends that approach to any multiqubit system. We first propose a graphical construction called W-state Stitching, where multiqubit entangled states are represented as tensor networks built from $W$ states. By analyzing the isotypic decomposition of copies of these graph states, corresponding graph Kronecker states can be constructed. In particular, graph states of generic multiqubit systems can generate any Kronecker subspace. We explicitly construct bases for three- and four-qubit systems and show that the W-stitching technique also serves as a valuable tool for multiqubit entanglement classification. These results may open new directions in multipartite entanglement resource theories, with bipartite and tripartite $W$ states as foundational elements, and asymptotic analysis based on Kronecker states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral thesis, 216 pages</p></details> |

While this is straightforward for convex objective functions, higher-order formulations pose challenges due to their inherent non-convexity. In this work, we propose branch-and-bound digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BB-DCQO), a quantum algorithm that addresses the relaxation difficulties in higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. By employing bias fields as approximate solutions to the relaxed problem, we iteratively enhance the quality of the results compared to the bare bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm. We refer to this enhanced method as BBB-DCQO. In order to benchmark it against simulated annealing (SA), we apply it on sparse HUBO instances with up to $156$ qubits using tensor network simulations. To explore regimes that are less tractable for classical simulations, we experimentally apply BBB-DCQO to denser problems using up to 100 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We compare our results with SA and a greedy-tuned quantum annealing baseline. In both simulations and experiments, BBB-DCQO consistently achieved higher-quality solutions with significantly reduced computational overhead, showcasing the effectiveness of integrating counterdiabatic quantum methods into branch-and-bound to address hard non-convex optimization tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

We identify that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. Operationally, this measure quantifies how well an operator can be approximated by one with only a few Pauli strings -- analogous to how entanglement entropy relates to tensor-network truncation. A notable advantage of operator stabilizer entropies is their inherent locality, as captured by a Lieb-Robinson bound. This feature makes them particularly suited for studying local dynamical magic resource generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that under random evolution, operator magic typically reaches near-maximal value for all R\'enyi indices, and we evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we solve the operator stabilizer entropy for interacting integrable XXZ circuit, finding that it quickly saturates to a constant value. Overall, this measure sheds light on the structural properties of many-body non-stabilizerness generation and can inspire Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+16 ...</summary><p>5+16 Pages, 2 figures. v3: fixed typos and added Appendix section</p></details> |

While these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on classical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may further improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However, embedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains challenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large bond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low success rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate multiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass classification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then remove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic encoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into a quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers and encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the performance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that synergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and scalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344v2)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 16 pages, 18 figures |

Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Enhancing quantum computations with the synergy of auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo and computational basis tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20066v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce QC-CBT-AFQMC, a hybrid algorithm that incorporates computational basis tomography (CBT) into the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) method proposed by Huggins et al. [Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)], replacing the use of classical shadows. While the original QC-AFQMC showed high accuracy for quantum chemistry calculations, it required exponentially costly post-processing. Subsequent work using Matchgate shadows [Commun. Math. Phys. 404, 629 (2023)] improved scalability, but still suffers from prohibitive computational requirements that limit practical applications. Our QC-CBT-AFQMC approach uses shallow Clifford circuits with a quadratic reduction of two-qubit gates over the original algorithm, significantly reducing computational requirements and enabling accurate calculations under limited measurement budgets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and nitrogen molecule, producing potential energy curves that closely match established benchmarks. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques. These results highlight QC-CBT-AFQMC as a practical quantum-classical hybrid method that bridges the capabilities of quantum devices and accurate chemical simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale-invariant phase transition of disordered bosons in one dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17682v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha > 2$. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha>3$ our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hydrodynamics of particle-hole symmetric systems: a quantum Monte Carlo study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13273v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of hydrodynamic behavior in electronic flow within clean, particle-hole-symmetric systems at half-filling is a non-trivial problem. Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe the momentum flow, while experimental measurements typically capture the current flow profiles. However, in particle-hole-symmetric systems, electric current and momentum flow are entirely decoupled because electrons and holes move in opposite directions with equal distribution functions. This makes it challenging to link NS equations to observed flow patterns. In this work, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic behavior of the charge current at half filling can emerge despite the absence of momentum flow. By combining Boltzmann transport theory with numerically exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of clean graphene samples, we show that NS-type equations can be derived directly for the charge current, eliminating the need for any additional mechanism coupling the velocity field and charge current in explaining the experimentally observed hydrodynamic flow profiles in graphene at half-filling. We show that a new transport quantity - the current diffusion coefficient - replaces viscosity and expect this description to be valid for any particle-hole symmetric system. Our results provide new insights into the interpretation of experimental data and demonstrate how Quantum Monte Carlo calculations can serve as an alternative to experiments in transport measurements to verify the kinetic theory results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures Accepted for PRL</p></details> |
| **[Dual role of stripe phase on superconducting correlation in a bilayer square lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17212v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the stripe phase has been observed not only in monolayer cuprates but also in bilayer cuprates, research on its behavior in bilayer cuprates has been limited. Using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo, we explore the effect of stripes on the bilayer square lattice. We find the system exhibits short-range antiferromagnetism, which is enhanced by stripes and is strongest when the electron density of the interstriped rows reaches half-filling. The hole doping concentration plays a crucial role in the interaction between stripes and superconductivity. The $d$-wave pairing is enhanced by stripe potential $V_0$ at the hole doping $\delta_h=1/4$, whereas it is suppressed by stripe potential $V_0$ at the hole doping $\delta_h=1/8$. We elucidate this phenomenon through an analysis of the magnetism of the interstriped rows. Furthermore, the effective $d$-wave pairing is stronger in the bilayer model compared to the monolayer model when stripes are introduced on the square lattice. Overall, our unbiased numerical simulations provide a further understanding of the crossed bilayer square lattice model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Best practices in Quantum Monte Carlo for metal catalysis: CO hydrolysis on Pt(111)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12475v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages,2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2212.01823; text overlap with arXiv:2004.10565, arXiv:2202.00542</p></details> |
| **[Universal term of Entanglement Entropy in the $π$-flux Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10602v4)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Boundary criticality in two-dimensional interacting topological insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12600v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the boundary criticality in 2D interacting topological insulators. Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we present the first nonperturbative study of the boundary quantum phase diagram in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard-Rashba model. Our results reveal rich boundary critical phenomena at the quantum phase transition between a topological insulator and an antiferromagnetic insulator, encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Combining analytical derivation of the boundary theory with unbiased numerically-exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of topological edge states enriches the ordinary transition that renders a continuous boundary scaling dimension and, more intriguingly, leads to a special transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Our work establishes a novel framework for the nonperturbative study of boundary criticality in two-dimensional topological systems with strong electron correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (6+4), 5 figures (4+1)</p></details> |
| **[Is fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo reproducible?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-size scaling on the torus with periodic projected entangled-pair states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12731v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient algorithm is constructed for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks under periodic boundary conditions. The central ingredient is a novel renormalization step that scales linearly with system size, i.e. from $L \to L+1$. The numerical accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art tensor network methods, while giving access to much more data points, and at a lower computational cost. Combining this contraction routine with the use of automatic differentiation, we arrive at an efficient algorithm for optimizing fully translation invariant projected entangled-pair states on the torus. Our benchmarks show that this method yields finite-size energy results that are comparable to those from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. When combined with field-theoretical scaling techniques, our approach enables accurate estimates of critical properties for two-dimensional quantum lattice systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04681v5)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Advanced measurement techniques in quantum Monte Carlo: The permutation matrix representation approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07295v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a typical finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, estimators for simple static observables such as specific heat and magnetization are known. With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06681v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 8 figures, article</p></details> |
| **[Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Frustrated Rydberg Atom Arrays Meet Cavity-QED: Emergence of the Superradiant Clock Phase](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05126v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rydberg atom triangular arrays in an optical cavity serve as an ideal platform for understanding the interplay between geometric frustration and quantized photons. Using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we obtain a rich ground state phase diagram. Around half-filling, the infinite long-range light-matter interaction lifts the ground state degeneracy, resulting in a novel order-coexisted superradiant clock (SRC) phase that completely destroys the fragile order-by-disorder (OBD) phase observed in classical light fields. According to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, this replacement may result from the competition between threefold and sixfold clock terms. Similar to the spin supersolid, the clear first-order phase transition at the $Z_2$ symmetry line is attributed to the nonzero photon density, which couples to the threefold clock term. Finally, we discuss the low-energy physics in the dimer language and propose that cavity-mediated nonlocal ring exchange interactions may play a critical role in the rich physics induced by the attachment of cavity-QED. Our work opens a new arena of research on the emergent phenomena of quantum phase transitions in many-body quantum optics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, comments are welcome and more information at http://cqutp.org/users/xfzhang/</p></details> |
| **[Binding energy of polaronic trions and biexcitons in CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09526v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effect of polaron formation on the ground state of excitons, trions and biexcitons confined in CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals is studied in the framework of effective mass Hamiltonians, using a Haken-like (Bajaj) potential for carrier-phonon coupling. The binding energy of trions agrees well with that observed in experiments, with position-dependent dielectric screening playing a significant role. For biexcitons, however, neither polaronic effects, nor dielectric confinement, nor electronic correlations -- here accounted for with a variational Quantum Monte Carlo method -- suffice to explain the large binding energies reported by single nanocrystal spectroscopy experiments. This result reinforces the hypothesis that biexcitons polarize the perovskite lattice differently from excitons and trions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic imaginary-time evolution in state-vector-based and shot-based simulations and on quantum devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04958v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaginary-time evolution, an important technique in tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms on classical computers, has recently been adapted to quantum computing. In this study, we focus on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the context of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are directly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the results with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables through repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the Heisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We further demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential of error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations for near-term digital quantum simulations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Elementary Excitations, Melting Temperature and Correlation Energy in Wigner Crystal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04538v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fully quantum-mechanical study of the energy-momentum dispersion of running waves, spin-conserving neutral excitations, and spin-reversal neutral excitations in a spin-polarized two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC). Our results show that the collective modes - plasmon and transverse sound - closely follow classical predictions even at surprisingly low values of $r_s \sim 8$. Furthermore, by extracting the shear modulus from the transverse sound speed, we find that quantum mechanical effects enhance the shear modulus at high densities, leading to a (Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young) melting temperature that exceeds the classical prediction. In addition, we apply the quasi-boson approximation to compute the correlation energy of the 2D WC based on its neutral excitation spectrum. While this approach underestimates the absolute correlation energy compared to quantum Monte Carlo results, it successfully captures the overall trend. These findings establish a robust quantum-mechanical foundation for understanding elementary excitations in Wigner crystals within low-dimensional electron systems and provide valuable theoretical insights for future experimental studies.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03882v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+15 ...</summary><p>8+15 pages, 3+7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03512v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and \mbox{(de-)confinement}. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

An approximate phase diagram at finite temperatures is initially constructed using the mean-field approach, which is subsequently validated through precise path-integral simulations, enabling a microscopic characterization of the various phases. Superfluid and melting/freezing transitions are analyzed through the superfluid density and the long-range behavior of correlation functions associated with positional and orientational order, in accordance with the general picture of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. A broad region at low temperatures is identified where the supersolid phase exists, separating the uniform superfluid phase from the normal quasi-crystal phase. Additionally, a potential intermediate hexatic phase with quasi long-range orientational order is identified in a narrow region between the normal solid and fluid phases. These findings establish self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory beyond the local density approximation as an effective tool, complementary to computationally intensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, for investigating the melting of the supersolid phase and the possible emergence of the hexatic superfluid phase in bosonic systems with various interaction potentials.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

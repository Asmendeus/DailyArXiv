| **[Lithographically-controlled liquid metal diffusion in graphene: Fabrication and magneto-transport signatures of superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03665v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal intercalation in epitaxial graphene enables the emergence of proximity-induced superconductivity and modified quantum transport properties. However, systematic transport studies of intercalated graphene have been hindered by challenges in device fabrication, including processing-induced deintercalation and instability under standard lithographic techniques. Here, we introduce a lithographically controlled intercalation approach that enables the scalable fabrication of gallium-intercalated quasi-freestanding bilayer graphene (QFBLG) Hall bar devices. By integrating lithographic structuring with subsequent intercalation through dedicated intercalation channels, this method ensures precise control over metal incorporation while preserving device integrity. Magneto-transport measurements reveal superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc,onset ~ 3.5 K and the occurrence of a transverse resistance, including both symmetric and antisymmetric field components, which is attributed to the symmetric-in-field component to non-uniform currents. These results establish an advanced fabrication method for intercalated graphene devices, providing access to systematic investigations of confined 2D superconductivity and emergent electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Compact Superconducting Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with On-chip rf Components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03608v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing systems and fundamental physics experiments using superconducting technologies frequently require signal amplification chains operating near the quantum limit of added noise. Both Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) and traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have been used as first-stage amplifiers to enable readout chains operating within a few quanta or less of the quantum limit. These devices are also presently entering the commercial industry. However, nearly all demonstrations and existing products require bulky external microwave components for interconnection and application of requisite biases. These components -- cabling interconnects, bias tees, directional couplers, and diplexers -- increase the overall amplifier footprint, installation complexity, and reduce already limited available cryogenic volumes. Additionally, these components introduce loss and reflections which impact the measurement efficiency and readout system noise performance; thus making it more difficult to operate near the quantum limit. Here we present the design and validation of microfabricated bias tees and directional couplers for operating three-wave mixing kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs). We report the performance of KITs integrated with the microfabricated rf components. Using these devices we demonstrate reduction in the amplifier installation footprint by a factor of nearly five and elimination of all external, lossy microwave components previously required to operate a KIT. Our device displays a 2.8 GHz 3 dB bandwidth with a median true gain of 17.5 dB and median system noise of 3.4 quanta. These efforts represent the first full integration of all rf components mandatory for TWPA operation on-chip. Our results mark significant progress towards the miniaturization and simplification of parametric amplifier setups and will aid in their more widespread applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pressure-driven superconductivity in the topological insulator GeBi4Te7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03281v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The van der Waals, pseudo-binary chalcogenides (ACh)m(Pn2Ch3)n (A = Ge, Mn, Pb, etc.; Pn = Sb or Bi; Ch = Te, Se) have recently been reported to host a vast landscape of topological phases of matter, including the quantum anomalous Hall state and topological axion state with quantized magnetoelectric effect. A subgroup in this series, like MnSb4Te7 and GeSb4Te7, can be driven to a superconducting state by applying a physical pressure, making them viable candidates to realize so-called topological superconductivity. However, the role of magnetic fluctuations in this pressure-induced superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we report the pressure-induced multiple superconducting phases in the nonmagnetic GeBi4Te7, accompanied by corresponding structural transitions evidenced from the high-pressure Raman scattering. In comparison with other members in this family, we find the superconducting transition temperature of the nonmagnetic subgroup is significantly higher than their magnetic homologues, possibly hinting at the detrimental role played by the magnetic fluctuations in the superconductivity formation, at least in this pseudo-binary chalcogenide family.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ephemeral Superconductivity Atop the False Vacuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02992v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A many body system in the vicinity of a first-order phase transition may get trapped in a local minimum of the free energy landscape. These so-called false-vacuum states may survive for exceedingly long times if the barrier for their decay is high enough. The rich phase diagram obtained in graphene multilayer devices presents a unique opportunity to explore transient superconductivity on top of a correlated false vacuum. Specifically, we consider superconductors which are terminated by an apparent first-order phase transition to a correlated phase with different symmetry. We propose that quenching across this transition leads to a non-equilibrium ephemeral superconductor, readily detectable using straightforward transport measurements. Besides enabling a simple detection scheme, the transient superconductor also generically enhances the false vacuum lifetime, potentially by orders of magnitude. In several scenarios, the complimentary effect takes place as well: superconductivity is temporarily emboldened in the false vacuum, albeit ultimately decaying. We demonstrate the applicability of these claims for two different instances of superconductivity terminated by a first order transition in rhombohedral graphene. The obtained decay timescales position this class of materials as a promising playground to unambiguously realize and measure non-equilibrium superconductivity.</p></details> | Published version |
| **[Nonuniform superconducting states caused by odd-frequency Cooper pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01673v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We discuss the origin of a nonuniform superconducting state in which Cooper pairs have a finite center of mass momentum. The instability to such a nonuniform superconducting state is analyzed by a pole of the pair fluctuation propagator for weak coupling superconductors. The results show that odd(even)-frequency Cooper pairs stabilize a nonuniform (uniform) superconducting phase below the transition temperature. We provide a theoretical framework that explains the reasons for appearing the nonuniform superconducting states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measurement of Many-Body Quantum Correlations in Superconducting Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12939v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Coexistence of topological surface states and superconductivity in Dirac semimetal NiTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01337v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The coexistence of topological bands around the Fermi level ($E_F$) and superconductivity provides a fundamental platform for exploring their interplay. However, few materials inherently display both properties. In this study, we demonstrate the coexistence of topological surface states at the $E_F$ and superconductivity in NiTe$_2$ single crystals, a material hitherto not recognized as superconducting. Quasiparticle interference measurements performed via scanning tunneling microscopy suggest the presence of topological surface states at the $E_F$, which is further corroborated by density functional theory simulations. Experimental evidence for superconductivity is provided via electronic transport measurements and specific heat capacity analyses. Our results suggest that NiTe$_2$ represents a promising platform for investigating the rich interplay between topological states and superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-momentum superconductivity in two-dimensional altermagnets with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08972v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically study finite-momentum superconductivity in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (RSOC). We show the phase diagrams obtained by solving a linearized gap equation, considering two directions of the N\'{e}el vector of the 2D altermagnet: parallel to the $xy$ plane (in-plane) and perpendicular to the $xy$ plane (out-of-plane). For the in-plane N\'{e}el vector, we find two different finite-momentum $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting states distinguished by a dominant pairing channel: an inter-band pairing or an intra-band pairing. Furthermore, it is shown that an anisotropic deformation of Fermi surfaces caused by spin-splitting effects due to the in-plane N\'{e}el vector and the RSOC can contribute to the stabilization of the finite-momentum superconductivity. We also perform the self-consistent calculations, and verify the existence of these superconducting states in addition to identifying other possible superconducting states and transition lines away from the phase boundary. For the out-of-plane N\'{e}el vector, the finite-momentum superconductivity is realized only in the inter-band pairing mechanism, which is in contrast to the in-plane case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integration of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits in 3D cavity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03985v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating 2D materials into circuit quantum electrodynamics (c-QED) devices is an emerging filed in recent years. This integration not only facilitates the exploration of potential applications in quantum information processing but also enables the study of material's fundamental properties using microwave techniques. While most studies employ 2D coplanar architectures with scalability potential, 3D cavity based c-QED devices, due to their simpler design, offer the advantage of a quicker turnaround to probe the composite Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, we construct the first flux-tunable, 3D cavity-compatible superconducting quantum circuit based on 2D materials, featuring a graphene superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) shunted by a capacitor that is accessible by both DC and microwave probes. We have shown how flux-modulated cavity frequency can be linked to the SQUID critical current under the influence of Fraunhofer pattern. In addition, we extracted the symmetry information of the SQUIDs based on DC analysis, and correlated this with the flux-modulated cavity frequency observed in microwave measurements. Our platform can extend to topological materials, holding the prospect of establishing valid topological JJs with DC probe while allowing fast microwave probe to avoid quasiparticle poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Condensation energy of superconducting BEC of non-interacting Cooper pairs in multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00473v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boson-Fermion models of superconductivity are getting attention as they are able to explain some of the high temperature superconductor's properties. Here we report on the condensation energy of a 3D non-interacting mixture of paired fermions (electrons) as Cooper pairs assumed to be composite bosons, which are responsible for carrying superconductivity, plus unpaired fermions both trapped in a periodic multilayer structure like that of the cuasi-two dimensional High-Temperature superconductor planes, generated by applying an external Dirac's comb potential in the direction perpendicular to the planes where superconductivity preferably occurs, while in the other two directions parallel to the planes the mixture moves freely. For bosons we give the Bose-Einstein condensation critical temperature, which we assume is equal to the superconducting critical one, while for both bosons and fermions we give the chemical potential, the internal energy and the entropy, all of them as functions of temperature, in order to calculate the Helmholtz free energy, which we use to obtain the condensation energy of a mixture of $N_F$ ideal fermions (electrons), which after turning on the attractive pair interaction become $N_B = N_{F}/2$ ideal bosons. For several plane impenetrability magnitudes, we calculate the condensation energy as the difference between the free energies of the fermions which are in the normal state minus that of the bosons in the condensed state, where we observe that as the plane impenetrability increases: the condensation energy increases; the critical temperature decreases, as expected for example for cuprate superconductors, and the behavior of the entropy and the internal energy show a dimensional crossover from 3D to 2D.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of Superconducting Behavior in Ruthenium Thin Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00233v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ruthenium (Ru) is a promising candidate for the next-generation of electronic interconnects due to its low resistivity, small mean free path, and superior electromigration reliability at nanometer scales. Additionally, Ru exhibits superconductivity below 1 K, with resistance to oxidation, low diffusivity, and a small superconducting gap, making it a potential material for superconducting qubits and Josephson Junctions. Here, we investigate the superconducting behavior of Ru thin films (11.9 - 108.5 nm thick), observing transition temperatures from 657.9 mK to 557 mK. A weak thickness dependence appears in the thinnest films, followed by a conventional inverse thickness dependence in thicker films. Magnetotransport studies reveal type-II superconductivity in the dirty limit ({\xi} >> l), with coherence lengths ranging from 13.5 nm to 27 nm. Finally, oxidation resistance studies confirm minimal RuOx growth after seven weeks of air exposure. These findings provide key insights for integrating Ru into superconducting electronic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Determination of Mid-Infrared Refractive Indices of Superconducting Thin Films Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00169v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a technique to determine the mid-infrared refractive indices of thin superconducting films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In particular, we performed FTIR transmission and reflection measurements on 10-nm-thick NbN and 15-nm-thick MoSi films in the wavelength range of 2.5 to 25 $\mu$m, corresponding to frequencies of 12-120 THz or photon energies of 50-500 meV. To extract the mid-infrared refractive indices of the thin films from FTIR measurements, we used the Drude-Lorentz oscillator model to represent the dielectric functions of the films and implemented an optimization algorithm to fit these oscillator parameters, minimizing the error between the measured FTIR spectra and the simulated spectra calculated using the dielectric functions of the films. To evaluate the consistency of the extracted dielectric functions, we compared the refractive index values extrapolated from these dielectric functions in the UV to near-infrared wavelengths with the values separately measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. For further validation, we calculated the sheet resistance of the films from their extracted Drude oscillator parameters and compared with the experimental values. This FTIR-based refractive index measurement approach can be extended to measure the refractive indices of thin films at wavelengths beyond 25 $\mu$m, which will be useful for designing highly efficient photon detectors and photonic devices with enhanced optical absorption in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity and pair density waves from nearest-neighbor interactions in frustrated lattice geometries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20911v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider superconductivity and pair density waves (PDWs) arising from off-site pairing in frustrated lattice geometries. We express the pair susceptibility in a generic form that highlights the importance of both the density of states, and the quantum geometry of the eigenstates and calculate the superfluid weight (stiffness) as well as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. Paradigmatic bipartite (Lieb) and non-bipartite (kagome) lattices are studied as examples. For bipartite lattices, nearest-neighbor pairing vanishes in a flat band. In the Lieb lattice flat band, we find a PDW at a finite interaction and show that its pair wave vector is determined by the quantum geometry of the band. In the kagome flat band, nearest-neighbor pairing is possible for infinitesimal interactions. At the kagome van Hove singularity, the pair susceptibility predicts a PDW due to sublattice interference, however, we find that its stiffness is zero due to the shape of the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that nearest-neighbor pairing at flat band and van Hove singularities is strongly influenced by the geometric properties of the eigenfunctions, and it is crucial to determine the superfluid weight of the superconducting and PDW orders as it may contradict the predictions by pairing susceptibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance intertwined with superconducting gap in kagome metal CsV3-xCrxSb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20735v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The newly-discovered chromium-based kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 has garnered significant interest due to its strong electron correlations, intertwined orders and potential for unconventional superconductivity under high pressure. However, the nature of superconducting and magnetic interactions during the transition from the parent compound CsV3Sb5 to CsCr3Sb5 remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance which intertwines with the superconducting gap, facilitated by the introduction of magnetic Cr impurities into the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. In addition to the gradual suppression of long-ranged charge-density-wave orders, dilute Cr dopants induce local magnetic moments, giving rise to the emergence of Kondo resonances. In addition, the Kondo resonance forms spatially anisotropic ripple-like structures around the Cr dopants, breaking all local mirror symmetries. This anisotropy arises from the antiferromagnetic coupling between itinerant electrons and the Cr-induced spin-up electrons. Remarkably, as the Kondo screening develops, the coherence peak and depth of superconducting gap with finite zero-energy conductance significantly enhances. It indicates that non-superconducting pairs at the Fermi surface in the parent compound participate in the Kondo effect, effectively screening the magnetic moments of Cr dopants while simultaneously enhancing the superfluid density. Our findings pave a unique pathway for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and local magnetic moments in kagome systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Phase Diagram of D-wave Superconductivity in the Square-Lattice $t\text{-}J$ Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15092v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hubbard and closely related $t\text-J$ models are exciting platforms for unconventional superconductivity (SC). Through state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations using the grand canonical ensemble, we address open issues regarding the ground-state phase diagram of the extended $t\text{-}J$ model on a square lattice in the parameter regime relevant to cuprate superconductors. On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure $t\text{-}J$ model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of doping ($\delta=0.1-0.2$), hosts robust d-wave superconductivity possibly coexisting with weak unidirectional pair density wave. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping $t_2$ suppresses pair and charge density waves, resulting in a uniform d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems. Our work validates the $t\text-J$ model as a proper minimum model for the emergence of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting dynamics in thin film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04439v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. Yet, it remains experimentally challenging to investigate such dynamics with high spectroscopic resolution in both frequency and momentum space, particularly in two-dimensional correlated systems. Here, we leverage Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a powerful and non-invasive tool to study thin-film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO), revealing several distinct dynamical phenomena across the superconducting phase diagram. At zero magnetic field and low temperatures, NV depolarization ($T_1$) noise spectroscopy captures the low-frequency (GHz-scale) magnetic noise generated by nodal superconducting quasiparticle excitations, in agreement with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field theory. Near the critical temperature $T_c \approx 90$ K, supercurrent-fluctuation-induced noise leads to a sharp reduction of the NV $T_1$. By carefully analyzing the temperature-scaling of $T_1$, we observe clear deviations from the BCS prediction, reflecting the importance of order parameter fluctuations and enabling the determination of both static and dynamical critical exponents. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of NV $T_1$ near $T_c$; the field-induced smearing of the transition unveils the presence of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, NV decoherence ($T_2$) noise spectroscopy allows us to characterize magnetic noise at even lower MHz-scale frequencies and obtain evidence for complex vortex-solid fluctuations well below $T_c$. Our results establish quantum noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>[Vers...</summary><p>[Version 2] revised with Methods and Supplementary Information. 9 pages, 4 figures in main. 4 pages, 2 figures in methods. 7 pages, 5 figures in supplementary information.

| **[Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 Pa...</summary><p>21 Pages, 9 Figures, and 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20254v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which the parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We further develop a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, in which the concrete example for $d=3$ parafermions is studied in detail. We also examine the real parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in superconducting devices. This work extends previous methods for twist defects in superconducting qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Friedel oscillations and chiral superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00273v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 1965 Kohn and Luttinger proposed a genuine electronic mechanism for superconductivity. Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two electrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise to Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among the electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The nature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that superconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for screening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign, a key to the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The momentum-resolved gap equations predict two degenerate solutions at the critical temperature Tc, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing. Their complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry, provides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped chiral phase well below Tc is in excellent agreement with the spectral function extracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Experimental realization of a quantum heat engine based on dissipation-engineered superconducting circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20143v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum heat engines (QHEs) have attracted long-standing scientific interest, especially inspired by considerations of the interplay between heat and work with the quantization of energy levels, quantum superposition, and entanglement. Operating QHEs calls for effective control of the thermal reservoirs and the eigenenergies of the quantum working medium of the engine. Although superconducting circuits enable accurate engineering of controlled quantum systems, beneficial in quantum computing, this framework has not yet been employed to experimentally realize a cyclic QHE. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum heat engine based on superconducting circuits, using a single-junction quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) as a two-way tunable heat reservoir coupled to a flux-tunable transmon qubit acting as the working medium of the engine. We implement a quantum Otto cycle by a tailored drive on the QCR to sequentially induce cooling and heating, interleaved with flux ramps that control the qubit frequency. Utilizing single-shot qubit readout, we monitor the evolution of the qubit state during several cycles of the heat engine and measure positive output powers and efficiencies that agree with our simulations of the quantum evolution. Our results verify theoretical models on the thermodynamics of quantum heat engines and advance the control of dissipation-engineered thermal environments. These proof-of-concept results pave the way for explorations on possible advantages of QHEs with respect to classical heat engines.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Many-Body Localization and Particle Statistics in Disordered Bose-Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03712v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the potential influence of the particle statistics on the stability of the many-body localization in the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. Within the higher-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, we find that there is no apparent finite-size boundary drift between the thermal phase and the many-body localized regime. We substantiate this observation by introducing the Van Vleck perturbation theory into the field of many-body localization. The appropriateness of this method rests largely on the peculiar Hilbert-space structure enabled by the particles' Bose statistics. The situation is reversed in the lower-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, where the significant finite-size boundary drift pushes the putative many-body localized regime up to the greater disorder strengths. We utilize the algebraic projection method to make a connection linking the disordered Bose-Hubbard model in the lower-energy section to an intricate disordered spin chain model. This issue of the finite-size drift could hence be analogous to what happens in the disordered Heisenberg chain. Both trends might be traced back to the particles' intrinsic or emergent Fermi statistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual spectroscopy of quantum simulated Fermi-Hubbard systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03477v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides remarkable insights into the real space properties of many-body systems, but does not directly reveal the nature of their fundamental excitation spectrum. Here, we demonstrate that radio-frequency spectroscopy can reveal the quasi-particle nature of doped quantum many-body systems, crucial for our understanding of, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we showcase how the existence and energy of magnetic polaron quasi-particles in doped Fermi-Hubbard systems may be probed, revealed by hallmark peaks in the spectroscopic spectrum. In combination with fundamental dualities of the Fermi-Hubbard model, we describe how these findings may be tested using several experimental platforms.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Phase diagram of a coupled trimer system at half filling using the Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02278v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat band systems have recently attracted significant attention due to their instability under small perturbations, which can lead to the stabilization of many exotic quantum phases. We study a trimer ladder which shows a middle flat band in the absence of onsite Coulomb interaction. We investigate the quantum phases of the Hubbard model on this geometry using exact diagonalization (ED), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and perturbation theory. We construct a quantum phase diagram in the plane of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameter $t_2$ and onsite Coulomb interaction $U$, revealing five distinct quantum phases. At low $U$ and moderate to high magnitude of $t_2$, the system exhibits metallic behavior, while at large $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, it transitions to a ferrimagnetic insulator phase, similar to those observed in certain trimer materials. In the small $t_2$ limit, the Fermi energy is in the flat band, leading to localization of the electrons within the trimer. At low $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, the flat band mechanism favors insulating ferrimagnetism, whereas at large $U$, ferrimagnetic states emerge from singlet dimer formation between neighboring sites of a trimer and an isolated corner spin, which connect ferromagnetically. The insulating cell spin density wave phase displays an up-up-down-down spin configuration due to competing nearest neighbor hopping, $t_1$. Interestingly, in moderate $U$ and $|t_2|>0.3$, the ground state behaves like metallic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics in the Two-Component Bose-Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11726v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model for two-component bosons using a strong-coupling approach within the closed-time-path formalism and develop an effective theory for the action of this problem. We obtain equations of motion for the superfluid order parameters of both boson species for both the superfluid and Mott-insulating phases and study these in the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit during a quantum quench for various initial conditions. We find that an additional degree of freedom for bosons leads to a richer phase diagram and out-of-equilibrium dynamics than the single-component situation.</p></details> | 29 pages, 9 figures |
| **[First-principles Hubbard parameters with automated and reproducible workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01590v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an automated, flexible framework (aiida-hubbard) to self-consistently calculate Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters from first-principles. By leveraging density-functional perturbation theory, the computation of the Hubbard parameters is efficiently parallelized using multiple concurrent and inexpensive primitive cell calculations. Furthermore, the intersite $V$ parameters are defined on-the-fly during the iterative procedure to account for atomic relaxations and diverse coordination environments. We demonstrate the scalability and reliability of the framework by computing in high-throughput fashion the self-consistent onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ parameters for 115 Li-containing bulk solids. Our analysis of the Hubbard parameters calculated reveals a significant correlation of the onsite $U$ values on the oxidation state and coordination environment of the atom on which the Hubbard manifold is centered, while intersite $V$ values exhibit a general decay with increasing interatomic distance. We find, e.g., that the numerical values of $U$ for Fe and Mn 3d orbitals can vary up to 3 eV and 6 eV, respectively; their distribution is characterized by typical shifts of about 0.5 eV and 1.0 eV upon change in oxidation state, or local coordination environment. For the intersite $V$ a narrower spread is found, with values ranging between 0.2 eV and 1.6 eV when considering transition metal and oxygen interactions. This framework paves the way for the exploration of redox materials chemistry and high-throughput screening of $d$ and $f$ compounds across diverse research areas, including the discovery and design of novel energy storage materials, as well as other technologically-relevant applications.</p></details> |  |

At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</p></details> | 24 pages, 17 figures |

This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |

This involves transferring such scenarios from donor atoms to a target atom. This induction is based on the enhancement of quantum transitions in the presence of multiple photons of the same transition. We use the quantum master equation for the Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard (TCH) model with multiple cavities connected to the target cavity via waveguides. The dependence of the efficiency and transfer of the scenario on the number of donor cavities, the number of atoms in them, and the bandwidth of the waveguides is investigated.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

The information contained therein has profound effects on observable quantities such as superconducting weight, Drude weight, and optical responses. Motivated by the recent advances in flat-band interacting systems, we investigate the role of interaction effects on the quantum metric. By using the fermionic Creutz ladder as a representative system, we show that the repulsive Hubbard interaction monotonically suppresses the quantum metric. While the eigenstates and their overlap quantifying the quantum metric can be obtained exactly in the presence of interactions through exact diagonalization, this method is limited to small system sizes. Alternatively, two theoretical proposals, the generalized quantum metric and the dressed quantum metric, suggest using renormalized Green's functions to define the interacting quantum metric. By comparing these analytical approaches with results from exact diagonalization, we show that the dressed quantum metric provides a better fit to the exact diagonalization results. Our conclusion holds for both flat-band and dispersive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures; close to the published version</p></details> |

For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schl\"afli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.</p></details> | 21 pages, 18 figures |

Despite of intense studies of many decades, there still lacks rigorous understanding of transport behavior for various quantum phases at low temperatures. Here we report on universal properties of DWs in one-dimensional repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model with arbitrary magnetic fields. In addition to the usual charge and spin DWs, we also construct the cross DW that captures the cross influences between the two degrees of freedom in the transport dynamics, showing a subtle spin and charge coupling effect. Our analytical expressions of the DWs at different Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phases essentially establish general relations between the Luttinger parameters and the DWs. We further obtain explicit universal critical scaling laws for DWs across various phase boundaries and propose an experimental protocol to measure the DWs.We find that the DWs obtained from the direct numerical simulation of this protocol show qualitatively good agreement with the Bethe ansatz results.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+21 ...</summary><p>6+21 pages, 4+1 figures</p></details> |

The system is coupled to fermionic cold baths which by the exchange of particles and energy induce relaxation in the system. We eliminate the environment and describe the system effectively by Lindblad master equations in various versions valid for different coupling parameter regimes. The early relaxation phase proceeds in a universal way, irrespective of the relative couplings and approximations. The system settles down to its low--energy sector and is consecutively well approximated by the Heisenberg model. We compare different Lindblad approaches which, in the late relaxation, push the system towards different final states with opposite, extreme spin orders, from ferromagenetic to antiferromagnetic. Due to spin frustration in the trimer (a three site ring), degenerate ground states are formed by spin waves (magnons). The system described by the global coherent version of the Lindblad operators relaxes towards the final states carrying directed persistent spin currents. We numerically confirm these predictions.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

Nevertheless, relatively few non-perturbative studies of correlated SSH models have been conducted in dimensions greater than one, and those that have been done have primarily focused on bond models, where generalized displacements independently modulate each hopping integral. We conducted a sign-problem free determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of the optical SSH-Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice, where site-centered phonon modes simultaneously modulate pairs of nearest-neighbor hopping integrals. We report the model's low-temperature phase diagram in the challenging adiabatic regime ($\Omega/E_\mathrm{F} \sim 1/8$). It exhibits insulating antiferromagnetic Mott and bond-order-wave (BOW) phases with a narrow region of coexistence between them. We also find that a critical $e$-ph coupling is required to stabilize the BOW phase in the small $U$ limit. Lastly, in stark contrast to recent findings for the model's bond variant, we find no evidence for a long-range antiferromagnetism in the pure $(U/t=0)$ optical SSH model.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 pages of supplemental materials</p></details> |

While submatrix updates were originally developed for Hirsch-Fye QMC with onsite interactions at finite temperatures [Phys. Rev. B 80, 195111 (2009)], their comprehensive application in DQMC has remained unexplored despite noted algorithmic similarities. We present the first comprehensive application of submatrix updates in DQMC, significantly extending beyond the original scope by enabling simulations with extended interactions and at zero temperature. Building upon conventional fast updates and delay updates, our generalized implementation achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, enabling simulations of the half-filled Hubbard model on lattices up to 8,000 sites - a scale previously challenging with standard DQMC implementations. This enhanced computational capability allows us to accurately determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

At $\nu=1/2$ and small $U$, they observe an enhanced compressibility on the $p_{x,y}$ sites, pointing to a flat band near the Fermi energy. At $\nu=1/2$ and large $U$ they observe an insulating ferrimagnet. Both small and large $U$ observations at $\nu=1/2$ are consistent with theoretical expectations. Surprisingly, near $\nu=1/4$ and large $U$, they again observe a large $p_{x,y}$ compressibility, pointing to a flat $p_{x,y}$ band of fermions across the Fermi energy. Our Hartree-Fock computations near $\nu=1/4$ find states with canted magnetism (and related spiral states) at large $U$, which possess nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ bands near the Fermi level. We employ parton theories to describe quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order found in Hartree-Fock. We find a metallic state with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization possessing gapless, fermionic, spinless `chargons' carrying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges which have a nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ band near their Fermi level: this fractionalized metal is also consistent with observations. Our DMRG study does not indicate the presence of magnetic order, and so supports a fractionalized ground state. Given the conventional ferrimagnetic insulator at $\nu=1/2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalized metal at $\nu=1/4$ represents a remarkable realization of doping-induced fractionalization.</p></details> |  |

Oxygen vacancies, particularly in positively charged states, are suggested to profoundly impact the polymorphism kinetics and phase stability of hafnia, thereby affecting its ferroelectric behavior. The electronic structures of pristine and oxygen-deficient hafnia polymorph have been extensively studied using density functional theory, primarily employing (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals. However, these methods often underestimate band gaps and may not accurately capture the localized nature of $d$-electrons. In this work, we investigate hafnia in various phases using DFT + $U$ + $V$, with onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently via the pseudohybrid Hubbard density functional, ACBN0, and its extended version eACBN0. We find that the self-consistent DFT + $U$ method provides comparable accuracy to the computationally more expensive Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional in predicting relative thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and density of states. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective approach for estimating the formation energies of oxygen vacancies. Additionally, we demonstrate that environmentally dependent Hubbard parameters serve as useful indicators for analyzing bond strengths and electronic structures in real space.</p></details> |  |

The critical exponents also agree well with the accurate results obtained from the 3D XY model.

Here, the fermionic part is constructed by a pair-product state, which explicitly depends on the phonon configuration, thus including the electron-phonon coupling in a backflow-inspired way. We report the results for the Hubbard model in presence of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger coupling to optical phonons, both at half-filling and upon hole doping. At half-filling, the ground state is either a translationally invariant Mott insulator, with gapless spin excitations, or a Peierls insulator, which breaks translations and has fully gapped excitations. Away from half-filling, the charge gap closes in both Mott and Peierls insulators, turning the former into a conventional Luttinger liquid (gapless in all excitation channels). The latter, instead, retains a finite spin gap that closes only above a threshold value of the doping. Even though consistent with the general theory of interacting electrons in one dimension, the existence of such a phase (with gapless charge but gapped spin excitations) has never been demonstrated in a model with repulsive interaction and with only two Fermi points. Since the spin-gapped metal represents the one-dimensional counterpart of a superconductor, our results furnish evidence that a true off-diagonal long-range order may exist in the two-dimensional case.</p></details> |  |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |

However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

| **[Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

The VMC results are in good agreement with the exact diagonalization (ED) calculation. For the single-hole case, the degenerate ground states are characterized by quantum numbers of a spin-1/2 and an orbital angular momentum $L_z=\pm 2$. The latter is associated with the emergent chiral spin/hole currents mutually surrounding the hole/spin-1/2 as a composite object or ``twisted hole''. A vanishing quasiparticle spectral weight is shown in the large-sample limit. In the two-hole ground state, the holes form a spin-singlet pairing with $d$+$id$ symmetry in the Cooper channel, but are of $s$-wave symmetry as a tightly bound pair of the ``twisted holes''. Such a pairing mechanism of dichotomy can be attributed to eliminating the local spin currents which has nothing to do with the long-range antiferromagnetic correlation. Superconducting ground state at finite doping is briefly discussed in terms of the tightly bound hole pairs as the building blocks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

This discovery of new family of high-temperature superconductors has garnered significant attention in the condensed matter physics community. In this work, we assume the this high-temperature superconductor is mediated by phonons and investigate the pairing symmetry in two distinct models: (i) the full-coupling case, where the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals are treated equally in both interlayer and intralayer coupling interactions, and (ii) the half-coupling case, where the intralayer coupling involves only the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, while the interlayer coupling is restricted to the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital. Our calculations reveal that the interlayer coupling favors an $s\pm$-wave superconducting state, whereas the intralayer coupling promotes an $s++$-wave symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications of pair-hopping interactions on the superconducting properties. These findings provide valuable insights into the pairing mechanisms and symmetry of this newly discovered high-temperature superconductor.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

The superconducting pairing symmetry is $s_\pm$-wave and is robust against the variation of the interaction strength. In this model, although the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are away from the Fermi level, the superconducting pairing function on them is not tiny. Instead, since the top of the $\gamma$ band and bottom of the $\delta$ band are both located at $\sim$500 meV away from the Fermi level, and they are almost nested by the peak structure in the spin fluctuation, thus by forming an anti-phase pairing function on them, these two bands act constructively to superconductivity. Finally with detailed derivation and numerical calculation, we demonstrate that the Fermi surface approximated Eliashberg equation may lead to deviation of the pairing symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.11429</p></details> |

However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.</p></details> |  |

In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we propose that superconductivity in this compound is primarily driven by interlayer pairing mechanisms. This interlayer pairing results in an effective $s_\pm$ pairing gap, with the sign of the pairing gap varying across different Fermi pockets. In the superconducting state, our analysis reveals a striking absence of a spin resonance mode. Moreover, we reveal a spectrum of energy-dependent incommensurate spin excitations. The observed incommensurate structures are elegantly explained by the nesting effect of energy contours, providing a coherent and comprehensive account of experimental observations. The implications of these spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are profound, offering critical insights into the superconducting mechanism at play. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of this novel superconductor but also pave the way for further research into the interplay between spin dynamics and unconventional superconductivity in layered materials.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

For La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/LaAlO$_3$(001), we find that compressive strain and electron doping across the interface result in the unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states. In sharp contrast, no charge transfer is observed for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/SrTiO$_3$(001). Surprisingly, tensile strain drives a metallization of the bonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, rendering a Fermi surface topology akin to superconducting bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under high pressure, yet with spin fluctuations enhanced considerably beyond pressure effects. Concomitantly, significant octahedral rotations are retained. We discuss the fundamental differences between hydrostatic pressure versus epitaxial strain and establish that strain provides a much stronger control over the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization. The results suggest epitaxial La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, particularly under tensile strain, as interesting system to provide novel insights into the physics of bilayer nickelates and possibly induce superconductivity without external pressure.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we report the superconductor-insulator transition in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ interfaces, with corresponding electronic structures revealed using synchrotron low-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray linear dichroism (XLD). In addition to the valence states of each element within the films determined by XAS, XLD at the O K edge pre-peak reveals hybridizations involving both 2p$_{z}$ and 2p$_{x}$/2p$_{y}$ orbitals, which are concomitantly suppressed upon oxygen loss. Intriguingly, such oxygen loss that eliminates superconductivity, induces a qualitative XLD change at the Ni L$_{2}$ edge, implying significant transformations among 3d$_{x^{2}}$ $_{-y^{2}}$ and 3d$_{z^{2}}$ energy bands near the Fermi level.

Here, we successfully probe the energy gap and dispersion renormalization in one unit-cell La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates, by developing an ultra-high vacuum quenching technique for in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. The energy gap is observed on the underlying Fermi surface without showing a node along the Brillouin zone diagonal. This gap exhibits particle-hole symmetric behavior and persists to a temperature higher than the superconducting transition temperature, indicating the existence of a pseudogap. An abrupt band renormalization is observed with a dispersion anomaly at ~70 meV below Fermi level, pointing to another energy scale besides the energy gap. These observations provide initial information on fundamental properties of the superconducting state in bilayer nickelates under ambient pressure.</p></details> |  |

However, while zero resistance state has been observed, experimental characterization of the superconducting properties of pressurized nickelates is still limited and experimentally challenging. Here, we present the first full temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 measurement in La4Ni3O10 single crystal, achieved by combining high magnetic field and high-pressure techniques. Remarkably, the Hc2 of La4Ni3O10 is nearly isotropic, with the anisotropic parameter monotonically increasing from 1.4 near Tc to 1 at lower temperatures. By analyzing the Hc2 using the two-band model, we uncover that the anisotropic diffusivity of the bands, primarily originating from d(z2 ) and d(x2-y2 ) orbitals, is well compensated, resulting in an unusually isotropic superconducting state. These findings provide critical experimental evidence that underscores the significant role of the d(z2 ) orbital in enabling superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we investigate the fate of the SC properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the SC pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Previous experimental works have confirmed the existence of a tiny energy gap formed with Ni 3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Here we investigate the physical origin of this gap by analyzing symmetry properties of energy bands based on the group theory. The tiny gap comes from energy bands with opposite parity at the Brillouin zone center. In addition, we also find previously unknown Dirac points in some momentum directions around the Fermi level. An effective Hamiltonian is constructed to describe low energy physics of the tiny energy gap and Dirac points. Due to the low crystal symmetry of monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, its energy bands display strong anisotropic properties.</p></details> | 14 pages 5 figures |

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

It is believed that the density wave (DW) at ~150 K plays an important role in SC emergence, but its nature remains largely underexplored. Here, we utilized temperature-dependent in-situ Ni K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to probe the Ni-3d/4p electronic states of La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta samples down to 4.8 K, enabling us to witness the evolution of both in-plane d_(x^2-y^2)/p_x (p_y) and out-of-plane d_(3z^2-r^2)/p_z orbitals of NiO6 octahedron across the DW transition. Main edge energy associated with Ni 4p orbital shows an anomalous decline near DW transition, signifying the occurrence of lattice distortions as a hallmark of charge density wave. Below DW transition, the enlarged crystal field splitting (CFS) indicates an enhanced NiO6 octahedral distortion. Intriguingly, magnetic Pr substituents could activate the mutual interplay of d_(x^2-y^2) and d_(3z^2-r^2) orbitals. We discussed its relevance to the favored bulk SC in the pressurized polycrystalline La2PrNi2O7-delta than pristine.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and other multilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

We find significant hardening of optical Ni-O bond-stretching phonons when going from non-magnetic to paramagnetic state, and increasing Coulomb interaction will make them even harder. The electron correlation is found to be sensitive to the Ni-O bond-stretching distortions, indicating strong interplay between electron correlation and lattice. We find that the strong local electron correlation will not favor charge orders that couple to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons, in support of the recent experiment that a $3a_0$ charge order is absent in the infinite-layer nickelates. Our results emphasize that the effects of local magnetic fluctuations should be fully taken into account when describing the lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelates without long-range magnetic orders, and also provide evidence to ascribe the kink observed in the recent angle-resolved photoemission experiment to possible strong electron coupling to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Has b...</summary><p>Has been accepted for a publication in PRB</p></details> |

Here, we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistance, and Meissner effect in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with hydrostatic pressures up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase above 40 GPa. Zero resistance of the superconductivity was achieved with a maximum onset $T_c^{onset}$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed until it disappears above 80 GPa, resulting in a right-triangle-like superconducting region. The direct-current magnetic susceptibility technique successfully detected the Meissner effect in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure; the maximum superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be 62.7% at 22.0 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals under high pressure.

To gain deeper insights into the distinct superconducting states, it is essential to unravel the nature of the density-wave states at ambient pressure, a topic that remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the direct visualization of an incommensurate unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in real space. The density of states (DOS) is strongly depleted near $E_F$, indicating the opening of a CDW gap of $2{\Delta} \approx 71$ meV, which is unfavorable for the formation of superconductivity at ambient pressure. We propose that the CDW arises from Fermi surface nesting, and is likely a subsidiary phase of a spin density wave. Compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the weaker electronic correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is likely one reason for the lower $T_c$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe and WSe$_2$ nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to $2.2\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for SnSe$_2$ and up to $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for WSe$_2$.</p></details> |  |

The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p></details> |  |

Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript just accepted in Nature Communications.

The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized.

When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures (Published version)</p></details> |

In this work, we exploit the intense excitonic PL of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer combined with the high refractive index of bulk WS$_2$ to fabricate microdisk cavities with tunable light emission characteristics. These microdisks are created from a 50-nm-thick WS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure using frictional mechanical scanning probe lithography. The resulting cavities achieve a 4-10-fold enhancement in excitonic PL from the MoSe$_2$ monolayer at wavelengths near 800 nm. The excitonic PL peak is modulated by sharp spectral features, which correspond to whispering gallery modes (WGMs) supported by the cavity. A microdisk with a diameter of 2.35 $\mu$m demonstrates WGMs with a quality factor of up to 700, significantly surpassing theoretical predictions and suggesting strong potential for lasing applications. The spectral positions of the WGMs can be finely tuned by adjusting the microdisk's diameter and thickness, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. This approach offers a novel route for developing ultra-compact, all-TMDC double heterostructure light sources with record-small size.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures allow for tuning their electronic properties beyond their monolayer counterparts. We start by determining their electronic structure using density functional theory. We obtain the type-II band alignment and close in energy conduction band minima (valleys) at the $K$ and $Q$ points in the Brillouin zone. The valence band maxima, also energetically close, are located at the $K$ and $\Gamma$ points. By analyzing the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions, we describe the layer, spin, and orbital contributions. Next, we construct an \textit{ab initio}-based tight-binding model, which helps us to better understand the complexity of the interlayer interactions. We determine the effect of a vertical electric field, showing that vertical gating enables control of valleys extrema and their occupancy. Finally, we employ the tight-binding model to investigate laterally gated quantum dots and analyze the influence of a perpendicular electric field on their energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate that tuning the electric field enables control over the valley character of the quantum dot states, selectively localizing them in either the $K$ or $Q$ valleys, as evidenced by their characteristic degeneracies and wavefunctions.</p></details> |  |

In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporate the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir\'{e} unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferromagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Moreover, the hybridization of states from different layers and different valleys is allowed near the Fermi level. Those aspects are in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-gap superconductivity in a Janus MoSeLi monolayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08119v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) lithium-decorated materials have emerged as a significant area of study since the prediction of superconductivity in lithium-decorated graphene at temperatures around 8.1 K, with experimental evidence observed at Tc = 5.9 K. Following earlier studies, this paper focuses on the hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer as a promising candidate for Li-decorated 2D materials. Our research reveals that lithium substitution on a selenium layer of MoSe2 can produce a hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer, which exhibits metallic behavior with potential phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.5 K. Additionally, by solving the anisotropic gap equations derived from Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we found that the Janus MoSeLi monolayer exhibits two-gap superconductivity. This finding underscores the potential of hexagonal Janus MoSeLi as a significant Li-decorated 2D material for exploring two-dimensional superconductivity and sets the stage for further investigations into new families of Janus transition-metal chalcogenides.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir\'e patterns of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H-stacking at a twist angle of 3.89$^{\circ}$ without spin-orbit coupling effect. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15$^{\circ}$. Multiple ultra-flat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7$^{\circ}$. The spin-orbit coupling leads to a giant spin splitting comparable to that observed in the untwisted system (about 0.45 eV) and is nearly independent of twisting and stacking. As a result, the K-valley flat band remains the valence band maximum with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Band unfolding reveals that the ultra-flat bands formed by the $\Gamma$ and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The $\Gamma$-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by structural reconstruction. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13$^{\circ}$) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</p></details> |  |

Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled local moment ``swapover'' and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moir\'e systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De Gennes approach, we systematically analyze the local density states, whose subgap energy dependence enables us to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes and identify the magnetic nature of the impurity. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial dependence of the local density of states is a sensitive probe of the microscopic processes resulting in subgap impurity-induced bound states. The Fourier analysis evidences the wavevectors related to the momenta of the high transmissive channels in ballistic graphene.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figure, 3 appendices</p></details> |

However, systematic transport studies of intercalated graphene have been hindered by challenges in device fabrication, including processing-induced deintercalation and instability under standard lithographic techniques. Here, we introduce a lithographically controlled intercalation approach that enables the scalable fabrication of gallium-intercalated quasi-freestanding bilayer graphene (QFBLG) Hall bar devices. By integrating lithographic structuring with subsequent intercalation through dedicated intercalation channels, this method ensures precise control over metal incorporation while preserving device integrity. Magneto-transport measurements reveal superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc,onset ~ 3.5 K and the occurrence of a transverse resistance, including both symmetric and antisymmetric field components, which is attributed to the symmetric-in-field component to non-uniform currents. These results establish an advanced fabrication method for intercalated graphene devices, providing access to systematic investigations of confined 2D superconductivity and emergent electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This sheet is placed on a boron nitride/ferromagnetic substrate such as cobalt or nickel. By using the Floquet theory, we determine the solutions of the energy spectrum. We calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients by applying the boundary conditions along with the transfer matrix method. These coefficients help determine their probabilities by current densities and group delay times by their phases. We numerically show that the laser field plays a crucial role in this structure, as it completely suppresses Klein tunneling compared to the case without laser. Furthermore, in contrast to the Hartman effect, the group delay time becomes dependent on the barrier width with the appearance of additional peaks. This suggests that fermion-field interactions cause additional delays within the barrier and also help to reduce spin coupling. Adding BN layers increases the interval of transmission suppression and completely eliminates coupling after the addition of three BN layers. Total reflection is observed for incident fermions with an angle less than $-1$ or greater than one.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures.

Solving the Dirac equation over five regions, we calculate transmission and reflection coefficients using the transfer matrix method, and analyze group delay time using a Gaussian wave packet and the stationary phase method. Our results reveal spin-dependent features in transmission and group delay time, with notable shifts between spin orientations, especially for configurations with up to three layers of boron nitride (BN). We observe enhanced Klein tunneling peaks and full transmission conditions for certain combinations of system parameters. The double-barrier configuration also significantly improves the group delay time compared to the single-barrier case. In fact, we show that the group delay time oscillates as the barrier width increases without showing signs of saturation, indicating the absence of the Hartman effect. This is in contrast to the single-barrier case, where the group delay time is found to saturate as the barrier width increases. In addition, we identify critical angles and maximum energies for evanescent modes.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Systematic Modulation of Charge and Spin in Graphene Nanoribbons on MgO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03927v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphene nanostructures can be engineered with atomic precision to display customized electronic states with application in spintronics or quantum technologies. In order to take advantage of their full potential, their charge and spin state must be precisely controlled. Graphene systems exchange charge to reach thermodynamic equilibrium with their environment, requiring external gating potentials to tune their ground state. Alternative strategies like intrinsic doping or substrate modifications provided small variations of their equilibrium charge and poor control over their spin. Here, we show systematic manipulation of the electron occupation in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) laying on MgO layers grown on Ag(001). Owing to the extraordinary decoupling properties of MgO, and the electropositive character of the substrate, GNRs are found to host an integer number of electron charges that depend on their length and shape. This results in the alternation between a non-magnetic closed-shell state and an open-shell paramagnetic system for even and odd electron occupations respectively. For the odd case, we found the spectral fingerprint of a narrow Coulomb correlation gap, which is the smoking gun of its spin 1/2 paramagnetic state. Comparisons of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) data with mean-field Hubbard (MFH) simulations confirm the practical discretization of the GNR electronic states and point to charge excess of up to 19 electrons in a single ribbon. We anticipate that GNRs supported by MgO ultra-thin insulating films can open the door to customized devices for quantum sensing and quantum processing applications..</p></details> |  |

These non-equilibrium magic angles can be traced back to specific static twist angles where the bandwidth reaches a minimum \textit{without} the formation of isolated flat bands. We refer to these as minimum twist angles, in contrast to the magic angles observed in twisted bilayer graphene. We show that an applied displacement field can further flatten the optically induced topological flat bands accompanied by larger non-equilibrium magic angles. The discovery of these electrically tunable topological flat quasienergy bands is expected to open up a new avenue of exploring exotic Floquet-driven phenomena in AA-stacked twisted multilayer graphene.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures, plus Supplemental Material</p></details> |
| **[Growth dynamics of graphene buffer layer formation on ultra-smooth SiC(0001) surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01757v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study the growth process of epitaxial graphene on SiC was investigated systematically. The transition from the initial buffer layer growth to the formation of the first monolayer graphene domains was investigated by various techniques: atomic force microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, low energy electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The data show that the buffer layer formation goes along with a simultaneous SiC decomposition which takes place as a rapid step retraction of one specific type of SiC bilayer in good agreement with the step retraction model. Once the buffer layer coverage is completed, the resulting characteristic regular repeating terrace and step height pattern of one and two SiC bilayers turned out to be very stable against further SiC decomposition. The following initial growth of monolayer graphene domains occurs, interestingly, only along the two bilayer high terrace edges. This behavior is explained by a preferential SiC decomposition at the higher step edges and it has some potential for spatial graphene growth control. The corresponding earlier graphene growth on one terrace type can explain the different scanning tunneling spectroscopy nanoscale resistivities on these terraces.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

In this study, we employ time-series CBED to visualize single Au nanoparticles deposited on graphene. The real-space image of the probed region, with the amount, size, and positions of single Au nanoparticles, is directly observed in the zero-order CBED disk, while the atomic arrangement of the Au nanoparticles is available from the intensity distributions in the higher-order CBED disks. From the time-series CBED patterns, the movement of a single Au nanoparticle with rotation up to 4{\deg} was recorded. We also observed facet diffraction lines - intense bright lines formed between the CBED disks of the Au nanoparticle, which we explain by diffraction at the Au nanoparticle's facets. This work showcases CBED as a useful technique for studying adsorbates on graphene using Au nanoparticles as a model platform, and paves the way for future studies of different objects deposited on graphene.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thermopower probing emergent local moments in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08686v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) have revealed the formation of flatbands, suggesting that correlation effects are likely to dominate in this system. Yet, a global transport measurement showing distinct signatures of strong correlations like local moments arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower as a sensitive global transport probe for measuring entropy, we unveil the presence of emergent local moments through their impact on entropy. Remarkably, in addition to sign changes at the Dirac point ($\nu = 0$) and full band filling ($\nu = \pm 4$), the thermopower of MATBLG demonstrates additional sign changes at the location, $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$, which do not vary with temperature from $5K$ to $\sim 60K$. This is in contrast to sensitive temperature-dependent crossing points seen in our study on twisted bilayer graphene devices with weaker correlations. Further, we have investigated the effect of magnetic field ($B$) on the thermopower, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$. Our results show a $30\%$ and $50\%$ reduction, respectively, that is consistent with suppression seen in the layered oxide due to the partial polarization of the spin entropy. The observed robust crossing points, together with suppression in a magnetic field, cannot be explained solely from the contributions of band fermions; instead, our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the entropy of the emergent localized moments of a strongly correlated flatband.</p></details> |  |

This integration not only facilitates the exploration of potential applications in quantum information processing but also enables the study of material's fundamental properties using microwave techniques. While most studies employ 2D coplanar architectures with scalability potential, 3D cavity based c-QED devices, due to their simpler design, offer the advantage of a quicker turnaround to probe the composite Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, we construct the first flux-tunable, 3D cavity-compatible superconducting quantum circuit based on 2D materials, featuring a graphene superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) shunted by a capacitor that is accessible by both DC and microwave probes. We have shown how flux-modulated cavity frequency can be linked to the SQUID critical current under the influence of Fraunhofer pattern. In addition, we extracted the symmetry information of the SQUIDs based on DC analysis, and correlated this with the flux-modulated cavity frequency observed in microwave measurements. Our platform can extend to topological materials, holding the prospect of establishing valid topological JJs with DC probe while allowing fast microwave probe to avoid quasiparticle poisoning.</p></details> |  |

Despite the existence of numerous experimentally synthesized 2D materials, none of them have been reported to meet DUV NLO requirements. Herein, to the first time, an experimentally available graphene-like BeO monolayer only formed by NLO-active [BeO3] unit is suggested as a promising 2D DUV NLO material due to its ultrawide band gap (6.86 eV) and a strong SHG effect (\{chi}_"22" ^((2))(2D) = 6.81 {\AA}\times pm/V) based on the first-principles calculations. By applying stacking, strain, and twist engineering methods, several 2D BeO sheets have been predicted, and the flexible structural characteristics endow them with tunable NLO properties. Remarkably, the extremely stress-sensitive out-of-plane \{chi}_"15" ^((2))(2D) and \{chi}_"33" ^((2))(2D) (exceptional 30% change) and the robust in-plane \{chi}_"22" ^((2))(2D) against large strains can be achieved together in AC-, AAC-, AAE, and ACE-stacking BeO sheets under in-plane biaxial strain, exhibiting emergent phenomena uniquely not yet seen in other known 2D NLO materials. Our present results reveal that 2D BeO systems should be a new option for 2D DUV NLO materials.</p></details> | 18 pages,5 figures |

Despite the rise of orbital Chern insulators, electrically switchable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains rare, necessitating further investigation. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced reversal of orbital Chern insulators in a moire superlattice composed of rhombohedral heptalayer graphene (r-7LG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At one electron per moire unit cell, two emerging Chern insulating phases - one pointing away from and the other toward graphene's charge neutrality point in the phase diagram of carrier density (n) versus magnetic field (B) - exhibit energetic competition modulated by both n and B. This switchable QAHE chirality in r-7LG demonstrates a layer-number dependent response: similar phenomena in moire r-6LG require much higher magnetic fields and are absent in thinner rhombohedral graphene. Our findings establish moire-engineered rhombohedral graphene as a promising platform for exploring topological quantum materials with electrically controllable chiral edge modes and magnetic order.</p></details> | 21pages, 12 figures |

In these systems, magnetic exchange interactions are primarily governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an anomalously prolonged decay of r to the power of (-n), where r is the M-M separation distance and n is between 0.5 and 2. This study investigates the impact of strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers using ab-initio density functional theory (DFT). A novel strain-engineering approach is developed by applying controlled tension or compression to the layers. Our findings reveal that strain significantly modulates the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling. Notably, the CoN4-G layer demonstrates a pronounced enhancement in RKKY coupling strength, oscillation amplitude, and reduced decay rate under strain. Conversely, the CuN4-G layer exhibits distinct behavior, maintaining decoupled spin chains and invariant electronic and magnetic properties despite applied strain. This work underscores the tunability of magnetic interactions in MN4-G layers via strain engineering, providing insights into the design of strain-controlled magnetic materials for next-generation spintronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Typos...</summary><p>Typos corrected; Refs added</p></details> |

However, graphene's inertness inhibits the adsorption of closed films, thus favoring island growth, whose inhomogeneity might be reflected in the induced properties. In order to study the homogeneity of the doping profile induced by an inhomogeneous coverage and the spin orbit coupling (SOC) induced in graphene, we deposited Pb(111) islands with an average coverage of up to 30 ML on monolayer graphene (MLG) on SiC(0001) at room temperature (RT). We investigated the transport properties and the structure using magnetotransport, and scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron deflection, respectively. The Pb(111) islands act as donors, increasing the electron concentration of graphene by about $5\times10^{11}\;\text{ML}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}$. The doping was found to be homogeneous, in stark contrast to our previous results for Bi islands on MLG. Upon percolation of the Pb layer at around 5 ML, hole transport through the Pb islands has to be taken into account in order to describe the transport data. The Pb(111) islands do not induce any Rashba SOC, contrary to theoretical predictions for an interface between Pb(111) and graphene. Moreover, they seem to screen the defects in the graphene, resulting in a reduction of the intervalley scattering rate up to 5 ML.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This work presents a comprehensive theoretical characterization of pristine and porous 12-AGNRs based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. DFT calculations reveal substantial electronic modifications, including band gap widening and the emergence of localized states. Analyzed within the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) framework, optical properties highlight strong excitonic effects and significant absorption shifts. Thermal transport simulations indicate a pronounced reduction in conductivity due to enhanced phonon scattering at nanopores. At the same time, MD-based mechanical analysis shows decreased stiffness and strength while maintaining structural integrity. Despite these modifications, porous 12-AGNRs remain mechanically and thermally stable. These findings establish porosity engineering as a powerful strategy for tailoring graphene nanoribbons' functional properties, reinforcing their potential for nanoelectronic, optoelectronic, and thermal management applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03139v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength squeezing, and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable polaritonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</p></details> |  |

Their complicated morphologies feature an abundance of folds, creases and wrinkles that make each crumpled membrane unique. Here, we prepare four nanomechanical resonators based on crumpled membranes of few-layer graphene and measure their static response and the spectrum of their dynamic response. We tune both responses with a dc voltage applied between the membrane and an underlying gate electrode. Surprisingly, we find that all four resonators exhibit hysteretic responses as the gate voltage is increased and then decreased. Concomitant discontinuities in the static response and in the vibrational resonant frequencies indicate a sudden change in the shape and in the tensile strain of the membranes. We also find that the hystereses can be removed and regular responses can be restored by annealing the resonators. We hypothesize that the hysteretic nature of the responses may originate from an interplay between the rugged morphology of the membranes and adsorbates trapped within the confine of the folds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The following article has been submitted to Applied Physics Letters</p></details> |

Recent studies have demonstrated that Pt atoms can intercalate at the heterointerface between SiC(0001) and the C-rich $(6\sqrt{3}\times6\sqrt{3})$R30{\deg} reconstructed surface (hereafter referred as the buffer layer). However, key aspects such as intercalated phase structure and intercalation mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we investigate changes in morphology, chemistry, and electronic structure for both buffer layer and monolayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) following Pt deposition and annealing cycles, which eventually led to Pt intercalation at temperatures above 500{\deg}C. Atomic-resolution imaging of the buffer layer reveals a single intercalated Pt layer that removes the periodic corrugation of the buffer layer, arising from partial bonding of C-atoms with Si-atoms of the substrate. In monolayer graphene, the Pt-intercalated regions exhibit a two-level structure: the first level corresponds to a Pt layer intercalated below the buffer layer, while the second level contains a second Pt layer, giving rise to a $(12\times12)$ superstructure relative to graphene. Upon intercalation, Pt atoms appear as silicides, indicating a reaction with Si atoms from the substrate. Additionally, charge neutral $\pi$-bands corresponding to quasi-free-standing monolayer and bilayer graphene emerge. Analysis of multiple samples, coupled with a temperature-dependent study of the intercalation rate, demonstrates the pivotal role of buffer layer regions in facilitating the Pt intercalation in monolayer graphene. These findings provide valuable insight into Pt intercalation, advancing the potential for applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Precision reconstruction of rational CFT from exact fixed point tensor network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18005v5)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in developing a controlled real space renormalization group (RG) scheme. Numerically approximate fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the "boundary-changing operators" (BCO) on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide concrete examples, such as Ising, Yang-Lee and Tri-critical Ising models to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. The BCO descendants turn out to be an optimal basis such that truncation in bond dimensions naturally produces comparable accuracies with the leading existing FP algorithms. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door towards understanding CFT in higher dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 12 tables; Published version</p></details> |

| **[Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 16 figures.

In this way we demonstrate that Markov processes with constrained occupation measures are realised optimally by self-interacting dynamics. We use a tensor network framework to guide our derivations. We illustrate our general results with new perspectives on well-known examples of self-interacting processes, such as random walk bridges, excursions, and forced excursions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages + References, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Robust ultra-shallow shadows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06022v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a robust shadow estimation protocol for wide classes of low-depth measurement circuits that mitigates noise as long as the effective measurement map including noise is locally unitarily invariant. This is in practice an excellent approximation, encompassing for instance the case of ideal single-qubit Clifford gates composing the first circuit layer of an otherwise arbitrary circuit architecture and even non-Markovian, gate-dependent noise in the rest of the circuit. We argue that for weakly-correlated local noise, the measurement channel has an efficient matrix-product representation, and show how to estimate this directly from experimental data using tensor-network tools, eliminating the need for analytical or numeric calculations. We illustrate the relevance of our method with both numerics and proof-of-principle experiments on an IBM Quantum device. Numerically, we show that unmitigated shallow shadows with noisy circuits become more biased as the depth increases. In contrast, using the same number of samples, robust ultra-shallow shadows become more precise with increasing depth for relevant parameter regimes. The gain in sample efficiency is still limited by the noise per gate, resulting in an optimal circuit depth per noise level. Experimentally, we observe improved precision in two simple fidelity estimation tasks using five-qubit circuits with up to two layers of entangling gates, by about an order of magnitude. Under the practical constraints of current and near-term noisy quantum devices, our method maximally realizes the potential of shadow estimation with global rotations and identifies its fundamental limitations in the presence of noise.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Compactfying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00627v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00497v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a method that generates ground state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for local observables and correlation functions. We also point out an interesting connection between this ansatz and a well-studied sequence in analytical number theory and the one-dimensional classical Ising model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient quantum tomography of a polynomial subspace](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00255v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum tomography is crucial for characterizing the quantum states of multipartite systems, but its practicality is often limited by the exponentially large dimension of the Hilbert space. Most existing approaches, such as compressed sensing and tensor network-based tomography, impose structural constraints on the state to enable more resource-efficient characterization. However, not all physical states can be well-approximated with highly structured states. Here, we develop a partial quantum tomography method based on direct fidelity estimation (DFE) that focuses on a neighborhood subspace -- the subspace spanned by states physically close to a given target state. Using this generalized DFE method, we estimate elements of the density operator within this subspace in a self-verifying manner. We investigate the efficiency of this approach under different sets of available measurements for various states and find that the set of available measurements significantly impacts the cost of DFE. For example, we show that Pauli measurements alone are insufficient for performing efficient DFE on all product states, whereas the full set of product measurements is sufficient. This method can be applied in many situations, including characterizing quantum systems with confined dynamics and verifying preparations of quantum states and processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universality in the Anticoncentration of Chaotic Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00119v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish universal behavior in the anticoncentration properties of random quantum circuits, demonstrating its broad independence from the circuit architecture. Specifically, universality emerges in a certain scaling limit and extends beyond the leading order, incorporating subleading corrections arising from the finite system size $N$. We compute these corrections through exact calculations on ensembles of random tensor network states and corroborate the results with analytical findings in the random phase model. We then identify a heuristic framework for generic brickwork circuits, conjecturing the universality of these corrections. We further support our claim of anticoncentration universality through extensive numerical simulations, capturing the distribution of overlaps for systems up to $N = 64$ qudits and computing collision probabilities for systems up to $N \leq 1024$. Collectively, our results highlight the critical role of finite-size corrections and lead to a thorough understanding of the core phenomenology governing anticoncentration in quantum circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 153 references</p></details> |

Here we introduce a new algorithm for gauging tensor networks using belief propagation, a method that was originally formulated for performing statistical inference on graphical models and has recently found applications in tensor network algorithms. We show that this method is closely related to known tensor network gauging methods. It has the practical advantage, however, that existing belief propagation implementations can be repurposed for tensor network gauging, and that belief propagation is a very simple algorithm based on just tensor contractions so it can be easier to implement, optimize, and generalize. We present numerical evidence and scaling arguments that this algorithm is faster than existing gauging algorithms, demonstrating its usage on structured, unstructured, and infinite tensor networks. Additionally, we apply this method to improve the accuracy of the widely used simple update gate evolution algorithm.</p></details> | 45 Pages. 11 Figures |

However, obtaining dynamical correlators at non-zero temperatures is generically hard even using these methods. Here, we introduce a practical approach to computing such correlators using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). While our primary method directly computes dynamical correlators of physical operators in real time, we propose extensions where correlations are evaluated in the complex-time plane. The imaginary time component bounds the rate of entanglement growth and strongly alleviates the computational difficulty allowing the study of larger system sizes. To extract the physical correlator one must take the limit of purely real-time evolution. We present two routes to obtaining this information (i) via an analytic correlation function in complex time combined with a stochastic analytic continuation method to obtain the real-time limit and (ii) a hermitian correlation function that asymptotically captures the desired correlation function quantitatively without requiring effort of numerical analytic continuation. We show that these numerical techniques capture the finite-temperature dynamics of the Shastry-Sutherland model - a model of interacting spin one-half in two dimensions.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth, namely higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic resource injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling and benchmarking of computational quantum advantage.</p></details> | 14 pages |

The tensor network constructed is one dimension higher than the lattice of the physical system, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes in 3D space. The network directly generalizes the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the order parameter of in the spin sector from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, and the correlation in the color sector.</p></details> |  |

The approach involves downfolding the full Hilbert space into a low-energy subspace that captures the most significant electron correlations, leading to an effective Hubbard model. This generalized model is then solved using tensor network methods. Our work focuses on one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional materials, for which we employ the machinery of matrix product states. We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps exhibit quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy.

| **[An Analysis of First- and Second-Order Optimization Algorithms in Variational Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19576v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, recent second order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first order methods. However, the relative performance of first order and second order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first order and second order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first order and second order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: second order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting away from the ground state. This makes second order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.</p></details> | 21 pages, 17 figures |

We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and non-stabilizer random circuits, with up to $1000$ qubits and $100$ layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with tens of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Quantum Non-Linear Bandit Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03023v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study non-linear bandit optimization where the learner maximizes a black-box function with zeroth order function oracle, which has been successfully applied in many critical applications such as drug discovery and hyperparameter tuning. Existing works have showed that with the aid of quantum computing, it is possible to break the $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ regret lower bound in classical settings and achieve the new $O(\mathrm{poly}\log T)$ upper bound. However, they usually assume that the objective function sits within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and their algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose the new Q-NLB-UCB algorithm which uses the novel parametric function approximation technique and enjoys performance improvement due to quantum fast-forward and quantum Monte Carlo mean estimation. We prove that the regret bound of Q-NLB-UCB is not only $O(\mathrm{poly}\log T)$ but also input dimension-free, making it applicable for high-dimensional tasks. At the heart of our analyses are a new quantum regression oracle and a careful construction of parameter uncertainty region. Our algorithm is also validated for its efficiency on both synthetic and real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Melting of devil's staircases in the long-range Dicke-Ising model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02734v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Identifying two-dimensional topological phase transition by entanglement spectrum : A fermion Monte Carlo study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02679v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among many types of quantum entanglement properties, the entanglement spectrum provides more abundant information than other observables. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group method could handle the system in one-dimension properly, while in higher dimension, it exceeds the capacity of the algorithms. To expand the ability of existing numerical methods, we takes a different approach via quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. By exploiting particle number and spin symmetry, we realize an efficient algorithms to solve the entanglement spectrum in the interacting fermionic system. Taking two-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger as example, we verify the existence of topological phase transition under different types of many-body interactions. The calculated particle number distribution and wave-function of entanglement Hamiltonian indicate that the two belong distinct types of topological phase transitions.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Machine-learned nodal structures of Fermion systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02257v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Ising phase transitions and thermodynamics of correlated fermions in a two-dimensional spin-dependent lattice potential](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20843v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a {\it numerically exact} study of the Hubbard model with spin-dependent anisotropic hopping on the square lattice using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. At half filling, the system undergoes Ising phase transitions upon cooling, leading to the formation of Ising-type antiferromagnetic order for repulsive interactions and charge-density wave order for attractive interactions at finite temperatures. By elegantly implementing the sign-problem-free condition and Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, we achieve significant improvements in precision control of the numerical calculations and obtain highly accurate results of the transition temperatures from weak to strong interactions across representative anisotropies. We further characterize the system by examining the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties, including the energy, double occupancy, specific heat and charge susceptibility. Specifically, we provide unbiased numerical results of the entropy map on temperature-interaction plane, the critical entropy, and the spin, singlon and doublon correlations, all of which are directly measurable in optical lattice experiments. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and investigate the possible emergence of stripe spin-density wave order in the system with repulsive interaction.</p></details> | 17 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with quantum selected configuration interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21081v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose using the wave function generated by the quantum selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method as the trial wave function in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). In the QSCI framework, electronic configurations are sampled from the quantum state realized on a quantum computer. These configurations serve as basis states for constructing an effective Hamiltonian, which is then diagonalized to obtain the corresponding eigenstate. Using this wave function, ph-AFQMC is performed to recover the dynamical electron correlation across the whole orbital space. The use of the QSCI trial wave function is expected to improve the feasibility of the quantum-classical (QC) hybrid quantum Monte Carlo approach [Nature, 603, 416 (2022)]. We call this integrated approach QC-QSCI-AFQMC, or QSCI-AFQMC for short. This method is validated across several molecular systems. For H2O and a linear H4 chain, we achieved chemical accuracy in most investigations relative to full configuration interaction while utilizing superconducting quantum computers at Osaka University and RIKEN. Additionally, the application of QSCI-AFQMC to the O-H bond dissociation in an organic molecule highlights the complementary synergy between capturing static correlation on quantum hardware and incorporating dynamical correlation via classical post-processing. For the N2, when QSCI-AFQMC is executed with a noiseless simulator, it ranks among the most accurate methods compared to various multireference electronic structure theories. Although the proposed method is demonstrated using small active spaces on current quantum devices, the concept is not limited to few-qubit problems. The QSCI-AFQMC can compete with state-of-the-art classical computational techniques, particularly in larger active spaces, displaying considerable potential for resolving classically intractable problems in quantum chemistry.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Enhancing quantum computations with the synergy of auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo and computational basis tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20066v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In general, quantum chemical calculations using quantum computers do not accurately describe dynamical correlation effects. The quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) algorithm proposed by Huggins et al. [Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)] addresses this challenge effectively. However, approaches such as classical and matchgate shadow tomography often require deeper circuits or large numbers of shots, making them less practical on current quantum hardware. In contrast, computational basis tomography (CBT) employs shallow circuits and is thus more suited to realistically constrained shot budgets, enabling efficient extraction of CI coefficients even with near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QC-CBT-AFQMC on molecular systems such as the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and the nitrogen molecule. The resulting potential energy curves agree closely with established classical benchmarks, including CCSD(T) and NEVPT2. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active-space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques. These results highlight the potential of QC-CBT-AFQMC as a practical method for quantum computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |

Our algorithm uses population dynamics to continuously suppress the sign problem, preventing its accumulation throughout the evolution. We apply it to a variety of quantum circuits and demonstrate significant speedups over state-of-art quantum trajectory methods and convergence to exact solutions even in non-Markovian regimes where trajectory methods fail. Our approach improves the efficiency of classical simulation of gate-based quantum computing, quantum annealing, and general open system dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[ByteQC: GPU-Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Package for Large-Scale Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17963v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying quantum chemistry algorithms to large-scale systems requires substantial computational resources scaled with the system size and the desired accuracy. To address this, ByteQC, a fully-functional and efficient package for large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, has been open-sourced at https://github.com/bytedance/byteqc, leveraging recent advances in computational power and many-body algorithms. Regarding computational power, several standard algorithms are efficiently implemented on modern GPUs, ranging from mean-field calculations (Hartree-Fock and density functional theory) to post-Hartree-Fock methods such as M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, random phase approximation, coupled cluster methods, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. For the algorithmic approach, we also employ a quantum embedding method, which significantly expands the tractable system size while preserving high accuracy at the gold-standard level. All these features have been systematically benchmarked. For standalone algorithms, the benchmark results demonstrate up to a 60$\times$ speedup when compared to 100-core CPUs. Additionally, the tractable system sizes have been significantly expanded: 1,610 orbitals for coupled cluster with single and double excitations (1,380 orbitals with perturbative triple excitations), 11,040 orbitals for M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order, 37,120 orbitals for mean-field calculations under open boundary conditions, and over 100,000 orbitals for periodic boundary conditions. For the advanced quantum embedding feature, two representative examples are demonstrated: the water cluster problem (2,752 orbitals) and a water monomer adsorbed on a boron nitride surface (3,929 orbitals), achieving the gold-standard accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Renormalization Group Flow at a Quantum Phase Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18622v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a controlled numerical study of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model at unit filling, providing evidence of the characteristic logarithmic finite-size scaling of the BKT transition. Employing density matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo simulations under periodic boundary conditions, together with a systematic finite-size scaling analysis of bipartite particle number fluctuations, we resolve boundary-induced complications that previously obscured critical scaling. We demonstrate that a suitably chosen central region under open boundaries reproduces universal RG signatures, reconciling earlier discrepancies. Finally, leveraging a non-parametric Bayesian analysis, we determine the critical interaction strength with high precision, establishing a benchmark for BKT physics in one-dimensional quantum models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Ground state of the S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12911v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L > 0$, where $\mu > \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Phases and Exotic Phase Transitions of a Two-Dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07613v5)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.</p></details> | 17 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices: Metal-insulator transitions, global antiferromagnetism, and enhanced boundary fluctuations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03416v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schl\"afli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.</p></details> | 21 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the restricted Hilbert space of Rydberg atom arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00482v5)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum and restore entanglement Hamiltonian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16709v6)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reduced density matrix (RDM) plays a key role in quantum entanglement and measurement, as it allows the extraction of almost all physical quantities related to the reduced degrees of freedom. However, restricted by the degrees of freedom in the environment, the total system size is often limited, let alone the subsystem. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum Monte Carlo scheme with a low technical barrier, enabling precise extraction of the RDM. To demonstrate the power of the method, we present the fine levels of the entanglement spectrum (ES), which is the logarithmic eigenvalues of the RDM. We clearly show the ES for a $1$D ladder with a long entangled boundary, and that for the $2$D Heisenberg model with a tower of states. Furthermore, we put forward an efficient way to restore the entanglement Hamiltonian in operator-form from the sampled RDM data. Our simulation results, utilizing unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish a practical computational framework for determining entanglement quantities based on the RDM, such as the ES, particularly in scenarios where the environment has a huge number of degrees of freedom.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal~\cite{ran2024hidden} experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+7 p...</summary><p>8+7 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |

This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms.

The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                |

However, direct implementation of three-qubit gates reduces the depth of quantum circuits, streamlines quantum programming, and facilitates efficient circuit optimization, thereby enhancing overall performance in quantum computation. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity scheme for implementing a three-qubit controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gate in a flip-chip superconducting quantum processor with tunable couplers. This direct CCZ gate is implemented by simultaneously leveraging two tunable couplers interspersed between three qubits to enable three-qubit interactions, achieving an average final state fidelity of $97.94\%$ and a process fidelity of $93.54\%$. This high fidelity cannot be achieved through a simple combination of single- and two-qubit gate sequences from processors with similar performance levels. Our experiments also verify that multi-layer direct implementation of the CCZ gate exhibits lower leakage compared to decomposed gate approaches. To further showcase the versatility of our approach, we construct a Toffoli gate by combining the CCZ gate with Hadamard gates. As a showcase, we utilize the CCZ gate as an oracle to implement the Grover search algorithm on three qubits, demonstrating high performance with the target probability amplitude significantly enhanced after two iterations. These results highlight the advantage of our approach, and facilitate the implementation of complex quantum circuits.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `<details><summary>`main ...`</summary><p>`main text: 8 pages, 4 figures; supp: 11 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables`</p></details>`           |

Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.`</p></details>`                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                |

A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems leading to a universal description of the nature of information dynamics.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 6 figures, 26 pages                                                                                                                            |

Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.`</p></details>` | 18 pages, 16 figures                                                                                                                           |

Here, we propose cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson junction devices.

We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive.

Superconducting qubits have emerged as a frontrunner among many competing technologies, primarily because of their speed of operations, relatively well-developed and offer a promising path toward scalability. Here, we address the challenges of optimizing superconducting qubit hardware through the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework that spans the entire process - from design to the calibration of hardware through quantum gate execution. We develop this framework in four key steps: circuit design, electromagnetic analysis, spectral analysis, and pulse sequencing with calibration. We first refine the qubit's core components - such as capacitance, Josephson junctions, and resonators - to set the foundation for strong performance. The electromagnetic analysis, using the Lumped Oscillator model, allows us to map out the capacitance matrix, ensuring that we minimize spectral dispersion while maximizing coherence times. Following this, we conduct spectral analysis to fine-tune the qubit's frequency spectrum and coherence properties, ensuring that the qubit parameters are optimized. Finally, we focus on pulse sequencing, including pulse-width optimization, DRAG optimization, and randomized benchmarking, to achieve high gate fidelity. We applied this framework to both Transmon and Fluxonium qubits, obtaining results that closely match those found in experimental studies. This work provides a detailed and practical approach to the design, optimization, and calibration of superconducting qubits, contributing to the broader effort to develop scalable quantum computing technologies.`</p></details>`                                                   | `<details><summary>`17 pa...`</summary><p>`17 pages, 18 fugures, 6 tables`</p></details>`                                                |

Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response bellow Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%.

We analyze the effects of zero and antiphase ({\pi}) pairing among different bands on the development of nonreciprocal effects and find that the rectification is not influenced by {\pi}-pairing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating multiband superconductors that break time-reversal symmetry produces significant signatures in rectification. The rectification exhibits an even parity dependence on the magnetic field and the average rectification amplitude across quantum flux multiples does not equal zero.

Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state.

Elemental superconductor Sn with a body-centered tetragonal structure, $\beta$-Sn, exhibits superconductivity below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}=3.72$ K) at ambient pressure. $T_{\rm c}$ of Sn increases with lowering dimension such as in thin film and nanowire growth, or by high-pressure application. For thin films, $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits a slight increase up to approximately 4 K compared to the bulk value, attributable to the crystalline size and lattice disorder. By applying pressure on a bulk Sn, $T_{\rm c}$ decreases with increasing pressure from 3.72 K to 5.3 K with the structural transformation into $\gamma$-Sn around 10 GPa. However, the combination of these effects on thin films of Sn, namely, thin-film growth and pressure effects, remains underexplored. In this study, we combined film-growth and pressure-application techniques to further increase $T_{\rm c}$ using a diamond anvil cell with boron-doped diamond electrodes. The drop of the electrical resistance suggesting the onset of $T_{\rm c}$ on the thin film reached above 6 K in $\gamma$-Sn phase. Further, the upper critical magnetic field was drastically enhanced. Atomic force microscopy suggests that the refinement of the grain size of the thin film under the non-hydrostatic pressure conditions contributes to stabilizing the higher $T_{\rm c}$ of $\gamma$-Sn.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                |

It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.`</p></details>`                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Similarly to conventional DFT, lattice DFT computes the ground-state energy of a given Hubbard model, by minimising a universal energy functional of the on-site occupations. Here we use machine learning to construct a class of scalable `semi-local' exchange-correlation functionals with an arbitrary degree of non-locality for the one-dimensional spinfull Hubbard model. Then, by functional derivative we construct an associated Kohn-Sham potential, that is used to solve the associated Kohn-Sham equations. After having investigated how the accuracy of the semi-local approximation depends on the degree of non-locality, we use our Kohn-Sham scheme to compute the polarizability of linear chains, either homogeneous or disordered, approaching the thermodynamic limit. approaching the thermodynamic limit.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 15 pages, 14 figures                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states.

Our focus is on comparing their dominant pairing symmetries. The results indicate that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is significantly enhanced at low temperatures in both doped nickelates and cuprates, whereas other typical pairing symmetries are effectively suppressed, highlighting the dominance of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing form. Additionally, we find that the effective pairing interaction for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing in doped nickelates is slightly lower than that in doped cuprates, which may be attributed to the different degrees of Fermi surface warping caused by the third-nearest hopping $t''$. Further studies show that the hole doping and interaction strength have significant effects on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction within the selected parameter range. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is notably weakened when the hole doping increases, whereas it is significantly enhanced with increasing Coulomb interaction strength $U$. This comparative analysis reveals the similarities and differences in the pairing behaviors of doped nickelates and cuprates, which may provide further insights into understanding the superconducting properties of these two classes of materials.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `<details><summary>`8 pag...`</summary><p>`8 pages and 12 figures.

In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances.

We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate Hubbard models on hexagonal lattice fragments and periodic hexagonal lattices, analyze gate costs, and provide commutator bounds for evaluating Trotter errors, including new commutator bounds for the extended Hubbard model. We compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, which we optimize for the hexagonal lattice Hubbard model, and demonstrate that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size.

The magnetic response of hole carriers, contributing to an emergent branch of spin excitations, is strongly suppressed. This effect is the consequence of d-wave-like pairing, enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude through a large nearest-neighbor attractive interaction.

Here, we report a constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) study of the square-lattice extended Hubbard model with on-site Coulomb repulsion U and nearest-neighbor (NN) electron attraction V. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.125, we find that the NN electron attraction V can notably drive an exotic spin-triplet (p-wave) superconducting (SC) phase, and enhance the p-wave SC correlations with the increase of V. But in the intermediate coupling regime, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (d-wave) does not significantly increase with the increase of V, indicating that the d-wave is not affected by V in strongly correlated system. Besides the pairing phase, a spin density wave (SDW) only exists near the half-filling in the particle-hole channel, and doping disrupts the formation of SDW order. Especially, the NN electron attraction V has no significant effect on SDW, reflecting the consistent relationship between d-wave SC and spin correlation. Moreover, as doping increases, the dominant region of p-wave also expands, further suppressing the presence of d-wave, which may help explain the disappearance of d-wave SC in overdoped cuprate superconductors. We also find the d-wave exhibits a singular nonzero (near point ($2{\pi}/3, {\pi}$)) condensation structure in momentum space, resulting in a different staggered behavior in the x and y direction with distance in real space. On the contrary, the p-wave condensed at zero momentum, and the p-wave correlation exhibits exponential decay in real space. Our work suggests the p-wave SC region can be induced and further broadened by the NN electron attraction V, offering a feasible mechanism to realize p-wave superconductivity in realistic cuprate materials.`</p></details>` | `<details><summary>`7 pag...`</summary><p>`7 pages, 4 figures in the main text and 4 page, 4 figure in the supplemental material`</p></details>`                                                                     |

State-of-the-art numerical simulations of the Hubbard model, such as those based on Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, often suffer from ergodicity issues, potentially leading to biased estimates of physical observables. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that leveraging i.i.d.\ sampling from the normalizing flow effectively addresses these issues.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `<details><summary>`14 pa...`</summary><p>`14 pages, 5 figures, contribution to the 41st International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2024), July 28th - August 3rd, 2024, Liverpool, UK`</p></details>` |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `<details><summary>`23 pa...`</summary><p>`23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added`</p></details>` |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                           |

Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 5 + 6 pages                                                                                                                               |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 5 + 5 pages                                                                                                                               |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane.

When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system.

The model parameters can be controlled independently, with dipolar couplings tuned by electric fields and motion regulated by optical lattices. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. These observations are supported by theory models established in different motional regimes that provide intuitive pictures of the underlying physics.

Recent experiments indicate that La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may be in the charge transfer regime, challenging the previous models based purely on the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. In this study, we propose a low energy model that incorporates doped holes in the oxygen $p$ orbitals. Given that the parent nickel state is in the $3d^{8}$ configuration with a spin-one moment, doped hole only screens it down to spin-half, in contrast to the Zhang-Rice singlet in cuprate. We dub the single hole state as Zhang-Rice spin-half and build an effective model which includes three spin-one states ($d^8$) and two Zhang-Rice spin-half states ($d^8 L$). At moderate pressure around $20$ GPa, the dominated oxygen orbital is an in-plane Wannier orbital with the same lattice symmetry as the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The resulting model reduces to the bilayer type II t-J model previously proposed in the Mott-Hubbard regime. Notably, the hopping between the in-plane $p$ orbitals of the two layers is still suppressed. Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation reveals a pairing dome with the optimal hole doping level at $x=0.4\sim0.5$, distinct from the hole doped cuprate where optimal doping occurs around $x=0.19$. Further increasing pressure initially raises the critical temperature ($T_c$) until reaching an optimal pressure beyond which the $p_z$ orbital of oxygen becomes favorable and superconductivity is diminished. This shift from in-plane $p$ orbital to $p_z$ orbital may elucidate the experimentally observed superconducting dome with varying pressure. As an extension, we also suggest a trilayer version of the type II t-J model as the minimal model for pressured La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, which is distinct from the models in the Mott-Hubbard regime.`</p></details>` | `<details><summary>`7+10 ...`</summary><p>`7+10 pages, 3+9 figures, 0+1 table`</p></details>`                                       |

The DFT calculations reveal that both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are active, which suggests a minimal two-orbital model to capture the low-energy physics of this system. In this work, we study a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model within multiband Gutzwiller approximation, and discuss the magnetism as well as the superconductivity over a wide range of the hole doping. Owing to the inter-orbital super-exchange process between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, the induced ferromagnetic coupling within layers competes with the conventional antiferromagnetic coupling, and leads to complicated hole doping dependence for the magnetic properties in the system. With increasing hole doping, the system transfers to A-AFM state from the starting G-AFM state. We also find the inter-layer superconducting pairing of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals dominates due to the large hopping parameter of $d_{z^2}$ along the vertical inter-layer bonds and significant Hund's coupling between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Meanwhile, the G-AFM state and superconductivity state can coexist in the low hole doping regime.

Such electron incoherence manifests itself most evidently in the non-Drude behavior of the optical response of the system and the anomalous density fluctuation behavior in the long wave length limit. The spectral weight transfer related to such dissipative response, which is absent in conventional Fermi liquid metal, has direct consequence on the dc transport property of the system in the normal state and the superfluid stiffness in the superconducting state. It is found that such electron incoherence remains significant even in the clean limit and at low temperature and thus must be attributed to the strong electron correlation effect in the cuprate superconductors. Here we study such an intrinsic effect in the 2D $t-J$ model through the variational calculation of its optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$. We assume a resonating valence bond ground state as our starting point and find that a significant portion of the total optical spectral weight remains incoherent throughout the phase diagram. The optical absorption is found to extend all the way to an energy of the order of the bare band width. We find that both the total optical weight $\bar{K}$ and the integrated incoherent optical weight $I$ increase monotonically with doping, with their ratio $R_{incoh}=I/\bar{K}$ decreasing monotonically with doping. Our results indicate that the majority part of electron incoherence in the 2D $t-J$ model can be attributed to the electron fractionalization mechanism assumed in such a treatment. We also find that the Drude weight deduced from $D=\bar{K}-I$ scales linearly with hole doping, without any sign of a non-monotonic behavior in the overdoped regime.`</p></details>`                                                                      | 11 pages,8 figures                                                                                                                        |

On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure t-J model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of hole doping ($\delta = 0.1 - 0.2$), hosts an exotic SC state where the d-wave and unidirectional pair density wave SC co-exist with spin and charge bond orders. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping $t_2$ suppresses the pair density wave and other co-coexisting orders, leading to a d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems. We reveal a simple mechanism for SC in the t-J model, in which the nearest neighbor hopping plays an essential role in driving the formation of Cooper pairs with real-space sign oscillations balancing the competition between the kinetic and exchange energies.

One naive expectation is to describe this system in terms of a two-orbital t-J model. However, we emphasize the importance of Hund's coupling $J_H$ and the $x=0$ limit should be viewed as a spin-one Mott insulator. Especially, the significant Hund's coupling shares the inter-layer super-exchange $J_\perp$ of the $d_{z^2}$ orbital to the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, an effect that cannot be captured by conventional perturbation or mean-field approaches. In this study, we first explore the limit where the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is Mott localized, dealing with a one-orbital bilayer t-J model focused on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Notably, we find that strong inter-layer pairing survives up to $x=0.5$ hole doping driven by the transmitted $J_\perp$, which explains the existence of a high Tc superconductor in the experiment at this doping level. Next, we uncover the more realistic situation where the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is slightly hole-doped and cannot be simply integrated out. We take the $J_H\rightarrow +\infty$ limit and propose a type II t-J model with four \textit{spin-half} singlon ($d^7$) states and three \textit{spin-one} doublon ($d^8$) states. Employing a parton mean-field approach, we recover similar results as in the one-orbital t-J model, but now with the effect of the $J_\perp$ automatically generated.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the conduction electrons are from the doped Cu atoms with valence close to $d^{9}$. Motivated by this picture, we build a two-orbital Hubbard model on a triangular lattice formed by the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals with total hole density (summed over spin and orbital) $n=1-p$. When $p=0$, the system is in a Mott insulator within this model. When $p>0$, we derive a $t-J$ model and perform a self-consistent slave boson mean field calculation. Interestingly we find a s-wave pairing in contrast to the one-orbital t-J model which favors $d+id$ pairing. S wave pairing should be more robust to disorder and may lead to high Tc superconductor with sufficiently large values of $t$ and $J$. However, the DFT calculations predict a very small value of $t$ and then the $T_c$ is expected to be small. If LK99 is really a high Tc superconductor, ingredients beyond the current model are needed. We conjecture that the doped Cu atoms may distort the original lattice and form local clusters with smaller Cu -Cu distance and thus larger values of $t$ and $J$. Within these clusters, we may locally apply our t-J model calculation and expect high Tc s-wave superconductor. Then the superconducting islands couple together, which may eventually become a global superconductor, an insulator or even an anomalous metal depending on sample details.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 6 pages, 2 figures                                                                                                                        |

In this paper we study possible superconductors from a t-J model with valley contrasting flux $\Phi$ using the slave boson mean field theory. We obtain a phase diagram with doping $x$ and $\Phi$. A finite $\Phi$ breaks spin rotation symmetry and the pairing symmetry is a superposition of spin singlet $d-id$ and spin triplet $p+ip$. There are two topological phase transitions when tuning $\Phi$ from $0$ to $\pi$, with three Dirac nodes at one transition and one single Dirac node at the other transition. We also discuss the effects of van Hove singularity and a three-site correlated hopping term on the pairing strength. Lastly, we demonstrate that a small anisotropy term breaking the $C_3$ rotation can lead to a time reversal invariant nodal superconductor connected to the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconductor on square lattice.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                           |

We choose a basis of two composite operators -- the constrained electrons and their spin-fluctuation dressing -- and approximate their currents in order to compute the corresponding Green's functions. We exploit the algebraic constraints obeyed by the basis operators to close a set of self-consistent equations that is numerically solved. This allows to determine the physical parameters of the system such as the spin-spin correlation function and the kinetic energy. Our results are compared to those of an exact numerical method on a finite system to asses their reliability. Indeed, a very good agreement is achieved through a far less numerically demanding and a more versatile procedure. We show that by increasing the hole doping, anti-ferromagnetic correlations are replaced by ferromagnetic ones. The behavior on changing temperature and exchange integral is also studied and reported.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                           |

This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved-photo-emission-spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants and is insensitive to the c-axis one. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `<details><summary>`4.1 p...`</summary><p>`4.1 pages, 5 figures with Appendix`</p></details>`           |
| **[Sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting in the nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07316v2)**  | 2025-01-28     | `<details><summary>`Show`</summary><p>`The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has drawn great attention. However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is $d_{xy}$, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged. Our work highlights the sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on low-energy electronic structure in multi-orbital superconductors, which calls for care in the downfolding procedure when one calculates their pairing symmetry.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `<details><summary>`29 pa...`</summary><p>`29 pages and 5 figures`</p></details>`                       |

Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons.

These nickelates crystallize in an orthogonal/monoclinic structure with tilted NiO$_6$ octahedra at ambient pressure and enter a density-wave-like phase at low temperatures. The application of pressure suppresses the octahedral tilting and triggers a transition to tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), which is believed to be a key prerequisite for the emergence of superconducting state. Here, by developing a high oxidative environment growth technology, we report the first tetragonal nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ microcrystals without octahedral tilting at ambient pressure. In tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, transport measurements find that both density-wave and superconducting transitions are absent up to 160 GPa, indicating a robust tetragonal metallic ground state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the band structure of ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ involves more $d_{z2}$ orbital contribution to the Fermi surface, compared to the monoclinic phase or the high-pressure superconducting tetragonal phase. The concurrent absence of density-wave state and high-pressure superconductivity in our ambient-pressure tetragonal crystals of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ suggests an underlying correlation between these two orders. It suggests that the tetragonal structure is not necessary, while the density-wave state is crucial for the superconductivity in nickelates.

Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.`</p></details>` | `<details><summary>`4 fig...`</summary><p>`4 figures, 3 tables, 15 supplemental figures`</p></details>` |

However, the precise crystal structure of the superconducting phase of the layered nickelates has not been fully clarified. Here, I use first principles calculations to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in the single-layer-trilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which is one member of the layered nickelates family that also shows signatures of superconductivity. I find a nearly dispersionless nondegenerate phonon branch in the parent $P4/mmm$ phase that is unstable along the Brillouin zone edge $M$ $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ $\rightarrow$ $A$ $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ at all investigated pressures up to 30 GPa. Calculations show additional doubly-degenerate instabilities along the edge $MA$ at lower pressures. I used group-theoretical analysis to identify the distinct low-symmetry distortions possible due to these instabilities and generated them using the eigenvectors of the unstable modes. Structural relaxations show that the lowest energy structures at 0 and 10 GPa involve condensation of both the nondegenerate and doubly-degenerate instabilities, which is in contrast to the experimental refinements that involve condensation of only the doubly-degenerate branch. I also find that structural distortions are energetically favorable at 20 GPa, contrary to the experiments that do not observe any distortions of the parent $P4/mmm$ structure at high pressures.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                               |

For a filling of n = 3.0 which corresponds roughly to the material which realizes the superconductivity of about 80 K under moderately high pressures above 14 GPa, the MEs exhibit a square-like pattern centered at (0,0) which originates from the intrapocket particle-hole scatterings. Furthermore, it was found that the MEs show very strong modulations on the interlayer momentum qz. With the increasing of qz, the patterns of the MEs change dramatically. In the large qz regime, they turn to be ruled by the interpocket excitation modes with significantly larger intensity which may play a vital role in the superconducting pairing. This hidden feature of the MEs was not revealed by previous studies. The established features of the MEs are found to be very robust against doping. They persist in the wide hole- or electron-doping regime around n = 3.0. However, in the heavily electron-doped regime, a Lifshitz transition will occur. Consequently, the behaviors of the MEs change qualitatively across this transition. With the absence of the hole pocket, we predict that a strong tendency toward the spin-density-wave (SDW) order will develop due to the perfect nesting between the electron and the hole pockets at n = 4.0. Thus, we have investigated the normal state behaviors of the MEs and their doping evolutions which may shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 9 pages, 9 figures                                                                                            |

Compared to other ambient-pressure superconductors, such as copper-oxide and iron-oxypnictides, unraveling the mechanisms of the pressure-induced superconductivity poses significant and unique challenges. A critical factor in this phenomenon seems to be related to the electronic configuration of 3d orbitals, which may play a fundamental role in driving high-Tc superconductivity. However, the pressure effects on the mixed-valence states of 3d-orbital cations and their influence on the emergence of high-Tc superconductivity remain poorly understood. Here, we use high-pressure (P) and low-temperature synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the influence of pressure on the mean valence change of Ni ions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results demonstrate that at a low-temperature of 20 K, the mean valence remains relatively stable across the pressures range from 1 atm to 40 GPa. Based on analyzing the absorption data, we find that, at a critical pressure, the ambient-pressure ordered phases disappear and both the structural and the superconducting phase transition occur. The pressure-induced structural phase transition revealed by our absorption results is consistent with that determined by X-ray diffraction, offering new information for a comprehensive understanding on the pressure-induced superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.`</p></details>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `<details><summary>`10 pa...`</summary><p>`10 pages and 4 figures`</p></details>`                       |

Unlike the $d$-wave superconductivity driven by the nearly half-filled $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in finite- and infinite-layers nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and coulomb interactions, we delve into the pressure dependent electronic structure of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster. We find that several possible charge and spin ordering states are nearly degenerate at ambient pressure but become strongly mixed leading to a more homogeneous phase at high pressure. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, the apical bridging O $2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states.

The addition of the other bands gradually suppresses the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation and enhances the antiferromagnetic ones. The superconducting pairing then evolves from a spin triplet into a $d$-wave spin singlet, and finally into an $s_\pm$-wave one.

An unstable orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. Quasi-particle peaks appear at the Fermi level due to an interorbital hopping between the localized ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ and delocalized Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness.

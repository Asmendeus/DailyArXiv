| **[Superconducting properties of thin film $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ studied via the NMR of implanted $^8$Li](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14591v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report measurements of the normal-state and superconducting properties of thin-film $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ using $^{8}$Li $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR). In these experiments, radioactive $^{8}$Li$^{+}$ probes were implanted $\sim21$ nm below the surface of a $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$(91 nm) film in $\mathrm{Nb_{0.75}Ti_{0.25}N}$(91 nm)/AlN(4 nm)/Nb and its NMR response recorded (via $^{8}$Li's $\beta$-emissions) between 4.6 K and 270 K in a 4.1 T field applied normal to its surface. Resonance measurements reveal wide, symmetric lineshapes at all temperatures, with significant additional broadening below the film's superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}(0 \; \mathrm{T}) = 15.4 \pm 0.7$ K due to vortex lattice formation. Fits to a broadening model find a magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(0 \; \mathrm{K})= 180.57 \pm 0.30$ nm and upper critical field $B_\mathrm{c2}(0 \; \mathrm{K})= 18 \pm 4$ T, consistent with literature estimates. Spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) measurements find a Korringa response at low temperatures, with dynamic (i.e., thermally activated) contributions dominating above $\sim100$ K. Below $T_\mathrm{c}$, we observe a small Hebel-Slichter coherence peak characterized by a superconducting energy gap $\Delta(0 \; \mathrm{K}) = 2.60 \pm 0.12$ meV and modest Dynes-like broadening. Our measurements suggest a gap ratio $2\Delta(0 \; \mathrm{K})/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{c}(0 \; \mathrm{T}) = 3.92 \pm 0.25$, consistent with strong-coupling behavior. Sources for the dynamic high-$T$ relaxation are suggested.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Superconducting Qubits: CMOS-Compatible Processing and Room Temperature Characterization for Scalable Quantum Computing beyond 2D Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18173v5)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on an industry-grade CMOS-compatible qubit fabrication approach using a CMOS pilot line, enabling a yield of functional devices reaching 92.8%, with a resistance spread evaluated across the full wafer 200 mm diameter of 12.4% and relaxation times (T1) approaching 80 us. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wafer-scale room temperature (RT) characteristics collected from multiple wafers and fabrication runs, focusing on RT measurements and their correlation to low temperature qubit parameters. From defined test structures, a across-wafer junction area variation of 10.1% and oxide barrier variation of 7.2% was calculated. Additionally, we notably show a close-correlation between qubit junction resistance and frequency in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation with a critical temperature Tc of about 0.71 K. This overarching relation sets the stage for pre-cooldown qubit evaluation and sorting. In particular, such early-on device characterization and validation are crucial for increasing the fabrication yield and qubit frequency targeting, which currently represent major scaling challenges. Furthermore, it enables the fabrication of large multichip quantum systems in the future. Our findings highlight the great potential of CMOS-compatible industry-style fabrication of superconducting qubits for scalable quantum computing in a foundry pilot line cleanroom.</p></details> | <details><summary>S.

We present the utilized proof-of-concept chip designs for qubit- and carrier chip, as well as the respective front-end and back-end fabrication techniques. In characterization of the newly developed microbump technology based on metallized KOH-etched Si-islands, we observe a superconducting transition of the used metal stacks and radio frequency (RF) signal transfer through the bump connection with negligible attenuation.

By automated waferprober resistance measurements at room temperature, we demonstrate a Josephson junction fabrication yield of 99.7% (shorts and opens) across more than 10000 junctions and a qubit frequency prediction accuracy of 1.6%. In cryogenic characterization, we provide statistical results regarding energy relaxation times of the qubits with a median T1 of up to 100 us and individual devices consistently approaching 200 us in long-term measurements. This represents the best performance reported so far for superconducting qubits fabricated by industry-grade, wafer-level subtractive processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>T.

| **[An engineering guide to superconducting quantum circuit shielding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14274v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this review, we provide a practical guide on protection of superconducting quantum circuits from broadband electromagnetic and infrared-radiation noise by using cryogenic shielding and filtering of microwave lines. Recently, superconducting multi-qubit processors demonstrated quantum supremacy and quantum error correction below the surface code threshold. However, the decoherence-induced loss of quantum information still remains a challenge for more than 100 qubit quantum computing. Here, we review the key aspects of superconducting quantum circuits protection from stray electromagnetic fields and infrared radiation, namely, multilayer shielding design, materials, filtering of the fridge lines and attenuation, cryogenic setup configurations, and methods for shielding efficiency evaluation developed over the last 10 years. In summary, we make recommendations for creation of an efficient and compact shielding system as well as microwave filtering for a large-scale superconducting quantum systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coexistence of high electron-mobility, unpaired spins, and superconductivity at high carrier density SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03824v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The $t_{2g}$ band-structure of SrTiO$_3$-based two-dimensional electron gasses (2DEGs), have been found to play a role in features such as the superconducting dome, high-mobility transport, and the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. This adds to the already very diverse range of phenomena, including magnetism and extreme magnetoresistance, exhibited by this particular material platform. Tuning and/or combining these intriguing attributes could yield significant progress within quantum and spintronics technologies. Doing so demands precise control of the parameters, which requires a better understanding of the factors that affect them. Here we present effects of the $t_{2g}$ band-order inversion, stemming from the growth of spinel-structured $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ onto perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Electronic transport measurements show that with LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ as the reference, the carrier density and electron mobility are enhanced, and the sample displays a reshaping of the superconducting dome. Additionally, unpaired spins are evidenced by increasing Anomalous Hall Effect with decreasing temperature, entering the same temperature range as the superconducting transition, and a Kondo-like upturn in the sheet resistance. Finally, it is argued that the high-mobility $d_{xz/yz}$-band is more likely than the $d_{xy}$-band to host the supercurrent.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Emergence of cross-layer composite spins in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure and possible routes to enhance its superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13442v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has been recently found to exhibit superconductivity in its high-pressure phase, similar to the previously discovered bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but with a notably lower transition temperature. To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |
| **[Demonstrating Coherent Quantum Routers for Bucket-Brigade Quantum Random Access Memory on a Superconducting Processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13958v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum routers (QRouters) are essential components of bucket-brigade quantum random access memory (QRAM), enabling quantum applications such as Grover's search and quantum machine learning. Despite significant theoretical advances, achieving scalable and coherent QRouters experimentally remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate coherent quantum routers using a superconducting quantum processor, laying a practical foundation for scalable QRAM systems. The quantum router at the core of our implementation utilizes the transition composite gate (TCG) scheme, wherein auxiliary energy levels temporarily mediate conditional interactions, substantially reducing circuit depth compared to traditional gate decompositions. Moreover, by encoding routing addresses in the non-adjacent qutrit states $|0\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$, our design inherently enables eraser-detection capability, providing efficient post-selection to mitigate routing errors. Experimentally, we achieve individual QRouter fidelities up to 95.74%, and validate scalability through a two-layer quantum routing network achieving an average fidelity of 82.40%. Our results represent a significant advancement in quantum routing technology, providing enhanced fidelity, built-in error resilience, and practical scalability crucial for the development of future QRAM and large-scale quantum computing architectures.</p></details> | 5 pages,4 figures |
| **[Lorentz force on superconducting vortices near line defects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13798v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In type-II superconductors, magnetic flux penetrates in the form of quantized vortices whose dissipative motion, driven by the Lorentz force, can degrade superconductivity. Understanding vortex dynamics in both homogeneous regions and near unavoidable structural defects is crucial for superconducting applications. This study examines a scenario in which a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) scans across a thin-film superconductor containing line defects. We first estimate the radial Lorentz force on a vortex in a homogeneous region using both analytical methods and numerical simulations based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm. For a film with a Pearl length of 400 micrometers and a SQUID height of 4 micrometers, we find that the SQUID tip can exert a force of approximately 3 femtonewtons on a vortex. We then evaluate the Lorentz force on vortices near two parallel line defects. Our results show that the Lorentz force is enhanced for vortices pinned on or between line defects. Vortices pinned on the line defects experience force enhancement predominantly perpendicular to the defects, while vortices in between experience enhancement along the defect direction. These findings enable more accurate estimation of Lorentz forces on vortices near line defects in thin-film superconductors and contribute to the broader understanding of vortex pinning and dynamics in defect-engineered superconductors. The methods can be extended to bulk superconductors and generalized to other defect geometries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06701v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

| **[A strong-driving toolkit for topological Floquet energy pumps with superconducting circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17915v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological Floquet energy pumps -- which use periodic driving to create a topologically protected quantized energy current -- have been proposed and studied theoretically, but have never been observed directly. Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

We present convincing evidence for spin-triplet pairing by soft point-contact spectroscopy experiments, using both spin-polarized and unpolarized electrons and additionally, by detailed analysis of the upper critical field, as inferred from the four probe resistance measurements. The experimental data are described in terms of the Anderson-Brinkman-Morel model of p-wave electron pairing. Our results confirm the predictions on strain-induced topological superconductivity by E.Tang and L. Fu (Nature Physics, 10, 964, 2014).</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Intertwined superconductivity and orbital selectivity in a three-orbital Hubbard model for the iron pnictides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13634v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a three-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model relevant for iron-based superconductors using variational wave functions explicitly including spatial correlations and electron pairing. We span the nonmagnetic sector from filling $n=4$, which is representative of undoped iron-based superconductors, to $n=3$, where a Mott insulating state with each orbital at half filling is found. In the strong-coupling regime, when the electron density is increased, we find a spontaneous differentiation between the occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, leading to an orbital-selective state with a nematic character that becomes stronger at increasing density. One of these orbitals stays half-filled for all densities while the other one hosts (together with the $d_{xy}$ orbital) the excess of electron density. Most importantly, in this regime long-range pairing correlations appear in the orbital with the largest occupation. Our results highlight a strong link between orbital-selective correlations, nematicity, and superconductivity, which requires the presence of a significant Hund's coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (inclusive of supplemental material), 4 figures in the main text, 5 figures in the supplemental material</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Properties of Two Superconducting Artificial Atoms Coupled to a Resonator in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15437v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We experimentally investigate a superconducting circuit composed of two flux qubits ultrastrongly coupled to a common LC resonator. Owing to the large anharmonicity of the flux qubits, the system can be described well by a generalized Dicke Hamiltonian containing spin spin interaction terms. In the experimentally measured spectrum, we observed two key phenomena. First, an avoided level crossing provides evidence of the exotic interaction that allows the simultaneous excitation of two artificial atoms by absorbing one photon from the resonator. Second, we identified a pronounced spectral asymmetry that is a clear signature of light matter decoupling. This multi atom ultrastrongly coupled system opens the door to studying novel processes for quantum optics and quantum-information tasks on a chip.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previous title: One photon simultaneously excites two atoms in a ultrastrongly coupled light-matter system</p></details> |
| **[Unifying Strain-driven and Pressure-driven Superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$: Suppressed charge/spin density waves and enhanced interlayer coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12733v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent strain-stabilized superconductivity at ambient pressure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ films opens new avenues for nickelates research, in parallel with its pressure-induced counterpart. Using density functional theory calculations, we elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ by comprehensively analyzing structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics. Consistent with recent scanning transmission electron microscopy observations, we find an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at $-0.9\%$ strain, preceding superconductivity onset. Electronic analysis shows compressive strain lowers Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital energy levels, while interfacial Sr diffusion effectively reconstructs the $d_{z^2}$ pockets, quantitatively matching angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. The interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\perp$ under pressure or strain closely tracks experimental superconducting $T_c$ variation. The dome-shaped pressure dependence and monotonic strain dependence of $J_\perp$ mainly arise from modulations in the apical oxygen $p_z$ energy levels. Moreover, compressive strain suppresses both charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities analogous to pressure effects, with SDW vanishing concurrently with the structural transition and CDW disappearing at $\sim-3.3\%$ strain. Our results indicate that suppressed density waves and enhanced $J_\perp$ are crucial for both strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity. Accordingly, we propose several candidate substrates capable of achieving greater compressive strain, thereby potentially increasing $T_c$.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconductivity and phase diagram in Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12603v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated ambient pressure superconductivity in compressively strained La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films, yet the phase diagram of heterovalent doping$-$critical for advancing the field$-$remains unexplored. Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Strange metallicity encompasses high magnetic field-induced superconductivity in UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12131v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The heavy fermion material UTe$_2$ hosts a suite of exotic superconducting phases, the most extreme of which resides in a narrow angular window of intense magnetic fields $>$ 40 T. Here we report that in the angular and field regime in which field-induced superconductivity is most robust, the normal-state resistivity exhibits a linear temperature dependence characteristic of strange metallicity, sharply contrasting with the Fermi-liquid behavior observed at low fields and away from this angular window. Through angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements in high magnetic fields, we find that the strange metal state is confined to a narrow angular range where field-induced superconductivity is also maximized, suggesting a shared underlying mechanism. These findings reveal a novel setting for strange metallicity - proximate to spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity - and point to the presence of quantum critical fluctuations, likely of a magnetic origin. The coexistence of strange metallicity and putatively spin-triplet pairing challenges prevailing paradigms of non-Fermi-liquid phenomenology, and highlights UTe$_2$ as a unique platform for exploring the interplay between unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH2 under extreme conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12062v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride, successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase P21m BiH2 exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 70 K among MH2type hydrides apart from H2S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for P21m and C2m BiH2 indicate that the upper critical fields miu0Hc2(0) is 12 to 16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar Tc. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH2, about 1.1 106 m s, which allows to classify BiH2 as a soft molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum Jc(0) is 10 kA mm2), which indicates the presence of two s wave superconducting gaps in BiH2 at 172 to 176 GPa: deltaL(0) is 6.9 1.2 meV and deltaS(0) is 1.5 meV.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Ab initio modeling of nonequilibrium dynamics in superconducting detectors and qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13791v3)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonequilibrium quasiparticle (QP) and phonon dynamics are central to the operation of superconducting devices. Superconducting detectors, such as the superconducting nanowire single-photon detector, perform best when a large QP population is generated in response to small perturbations. Conversely, for superconducting qubits and topologically protected Majorana fermions, even relatively small QP densities can lead to significant performance degradation, and thus, ideal materials are less susceptible to QP poisoning. However, existing models of these devices lack a rigorous description of the QP and phonon dynamics, relying on approximations and phenomenology. In this article, we combine kinetic equations with density functional theory to model the nonequilibrium dynamics of a superconducting film ab initio. To demonstrate the universality of our model, we illustrate two examples: (1) we develop a model for the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires, and (2) we calculate the energy-relaxation rate of a transmon qubit due to the presence of excess QPs. Our examples demonstrate from first principles that NbN is well-suited for single-photon detection and that Ta transmon qubits possess reduced sensitivity to QP poisoning relative to other materials, which is likely in part responsible for their longer coherence times. In contrast to previous models, our ab initio approach makes these predictions without experimental input and thus can be used to accelerate progress in device development. Moreover, by considering the full-bandwidth electron-phonon coupling, our approach can incorporate strong-coupling effects. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with nonequilibrium theory of superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Taking strong correlations into account carefully, we find a ferromagnetically ordered state, in which one of the three components becomes dominant, when holes are doped away from one-third filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this ferromagnetically ordered phase undergoes a first-order transition to a paramagnetic state. We clarify the stability of the ferromagnetically ordered state against interaction strength, hole doping, and temperatures. The relevance of generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism is also addressed, by comparing the results on the Bethe lattice.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: II. Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09910v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid (NF). In contrast, the insulating phases that survive at high temperatures in the presence of disorder are the Bose glass and the normal fluid. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09311v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Superconductor-Insulator transition in a two-orbital attractive Hubbard model with Hund's exchange](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08597v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a two-orbital attractive Hubbard model with a repulsive Hund's exchange coupling $J$ as an idealized model for a two-band superconductor. This framework is motivated by a system where a large isotropic electron-phonon coupling drives the on-site Hubbard repulsion $U$ negative, while leaving the exchange term unaffected. We focus on the intra-orbital (intra-band) singlet superconducting phase and we solve the model at zero temperature and half-filling using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. Already at $J=0$, the two-orbital model features a superconductor-insulator transition as $\vert U\vert$ grows, as opposed to the single-orbital case which remains superconducting for any $U < 0$. We find that a finite $J$ strengthens the effect of the attractive $U$, both in the normal state and, more significantly, in the superconducting state. However, this pushes the system towards an effectively stronger coupling, hence to a faster transition to the insulating state. Remarkably, the transition from a superconductor to an insulator occurs with a vanishing quasi-particle weight $Z$ and in a scenario that recalls strongly correlated superconductivity close to a Mott transition, even though the present model is dominated by attractive interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Since lattice dynamical properties are closely linked to electronic structures, the Hubbard-corrected density functional perturbation theory (DFPT+$U$) can calculate them at the same level of accuracy. To investigate the effects of $U$ on electron-phonon (el-ph) interactions, we implemented DFPT+$U$ with a Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism to determine $U$ self-consistently and applied our method to compute optical and transport properties of transparent conductive oxides of CdO and ZnO. For CdO, we find that opening a band gap due to $U$ restores the long-range Fr\"ohlich interaction and that its calculated mobility and absorption spectrum are in excellent agreement with experiments. For ZnO where a band gap already appears at the DFT level, DFPT+$U$ brings the results into much closer alignment with experiment, thus demonstrating improved accuracy of our method in dealing with el-ph interactions in these technologically important materials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classical Benchmarks for Variational Quantum Eigensolver Simulations of the Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00836v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the Hubbard model is of great interest to a wide range of applications within condensed matter physics, however its solution on classical computers remains challenging in dimensions larger than one. The relative simplicity of this model, embodied by the sparseness of the Hamiltonian matrix, allows for its efficient implementation on quantum computers, and for its approximate solution using variational algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver. While these algorithms have been shown to reproduce the qualitative features of the Hubbard model, their quantitative accuracy in terms of producing true ground state energies and other properties, and the dependence of this accuracy on the system size and interaction strength, the choice of variational ansatz, and the degree of spatial inhomogeneity in the model, remains unknown. Here we present a rigorous classical benchmarking study, demonstrating the potential impact of these factors on the accuracy of the variational solution of the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, for systems with up to $32$ qubits. We find that even when using the most accurate wavefunction ans\"{a}tze for the Hubbard model, the error in its ground state energy and wavefunction plateaus for larger lattices, while stronger electronic correlations magnify this issue. Concurrently, spatially inhomogeneous parameters and the presence of off-site Coulomb interactions only have a small effect on the accuracy of the computed ground state energies. Our study highlights the capabilities and limitations of current approaches for solving the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, and we discuss potential future avenues of research.</p></details> |  |

We find that the electron-phonon interaction is strongly suppressed by electronic correlations, while electron-electron correlation effects at Fermi liquid scales are only weakly modified by coupling to phonons, with phonon-induced modifications most evident at high frequencies on the order of the electronic bandwidth. Implications for beyond-density functional theories of the electron-phonon interaction are discussed.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In the paradigmatic case of the Hubbard model, Nagaoka famously proved that introducing a single itinerant charge can transform a paramagnetic insulator into a ferromagnet through path interference. However, a microscopic observation of such kinetic magnetism induced by individually imaged dopants has been so far elusive. Here we demonstrate the emergence of Nagaoka polarons in a Hubbard system realized with strongly interacting fermions in a triangular optical lattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we reveal these polarons as extended ferromagnetic bubbles around particle dopants arising from the local interplay of coherent dopant motion and spin exchange. In contrast, kinetic frustration due to the triangular geometry promotes antiferromagnetic polarons around hole dopants, as proposed by Haerter and Shastry. Our work augurs the exploration of exotic quantum phases driven by charge motion in strongly correlated systems and over sizes that are challenging for numerical simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+12 ...</summary><p>9+12 pages, 4+7 figures, accepted version with author correction</p></details> |
| **[Comparative analysis of methods for calculating Hubbard parameters using cRPA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11142v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a systematic comparison of various approaches within the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) for calculating the Coulomb interaction parameter $U$. While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO$_{2}$ (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO$_{3}$ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.</p></details> |  |

To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagom\'e geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moir\'e TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

The paper is devoted to the reduced version of this task in which one only computes the real quantities called singular values. It is shown that in such an approach (and under suitable constraints including the tridiagonality of the Hamiltdonian) the singular values can be sought as poles of an auxiliary Green's function expressible in terms of a doublet of matrix continued fractions. A family of multi-bosonic Bose-Hubbard-like complex Hamiltonians is recalled for illustration purposes.</p></details> | 31 pp., 3 pictures |
| **[A Hubbard exciton fluid in a photo-doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05566v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The undoped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator naturally has one charge carrier per lattice site. When it is doped with additional carriers, they are unstable to spin fluctuation-mediated Cooper pairing as well as other unconventional types of charge, spin, and orbital current ordering. Photo-excitation can produce charge carriers in the form of empty (holons) and doubly occupied (doublons) sites that may also exhibit charge instabilities. There is evidence that antiferromagnetic correlations enhance attractive interactions between holons and doublons, which can then form bound pairs known as Hubbard excitons, and that these might self-organize into an insulating Hubbard exciton fluid. However, this out-of-equilibrium phenomenon has not been detected experimentally. Here, we report the transient formation of a Hubbard exciton fluid in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ using ultrafast terahertz conductivity. Following photo-excitation, we observe rapid spectral weight transfer from a Drude metallic response to an insulating response. The latter is characterized by a finite energy peak originating from intra-excitonic transitions, whose assignment is corroborated by our numerical simulations of an extended Hubbard model. The lifetime of the peak is short, approximately one picosecond, and scales exponentially with Mott gap size, implying extremely strong coupling to magnon modes.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages main text, 4 figures, 4 extended figures, 19 pages supplementary information</p></details> |
| **[Magnetic ground states of highly doped two-leg Hubbard ladders with a particle bath](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05350v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the ground-state magnetism of a Hubbard model in a system consisting of a main frame (subsystem) and a particle bath (center sites). The hole doping in the main frame is controlled by adjusting the chemical potential of the particle bath. In the weakly doped region, the saturated ferromagnetic state emerges due to the Nagaoka mechanism [Phys. Rev. B 90, 224426 (2014)]. However, in the highly doped region, a variety of intriguing magnetic states are observed, including partially polarized states and nonmagnetic states. To understand these states, we analyze the state of the subsystem by comparing its properties with those of a two-leg ladder system, which corresponds to the subsystem with the center sites removed. Furthermore, to gain insight into the microscopic origin of the magnetic phase diagram, we study the ground state of the corresponding effective t-J model, derived from the Hubbard model by considering the second-order processes of the electron hopping. The phase diagram is well reproduced by the effective t-J model, which includes the three-site pair-hopping term. To elucidate the competition among different energy contributions, such as potential, kinetic, and magnetic energies, we classify the energies within the effective t-J model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present the rich phase diagram of interacting bosons in disordered two-dimensional optical lattice, modelled by the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. We systematically probe the effect of long-range interaction truncated to the nearest neighbors and next-nearest neighbors on the phase diagram. We investigate the zero-temperature ground-state quantum phases using the single-site Gutzwiller mean field (SGMF) theory. We also employ strong-coupling perturbative expansion to identify the nature of ground-state solid phases analytically. At sufficiently high disorder strength, we observe a quantum phase transition between the DS and BG phases. We have investigated this transition in greater detail using cluster Gutzwiller mean field theory to study the effect of inter-site correlations which is absent in the SGMF method. We have also studied this phase transition from the perspective of percolation theory.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Magnons from time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory and nonempirical Hubbard functionals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19504v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin excitations play a fundamental role in understanding magnetic properties of materials, and have significant technological implications for magnonic devices. However, accurately modeling these in transition-metal and rare-earth compounds remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a fully first-principles approach for calculating spin-wave spectra based on time-dependent (TD) density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), using nonempirical Hubbard functionals. This approach is implemented in a general noncollinear formulation, enabling the study of magnons in both collinear and noncollinear magnetic systems. Unlike methods that rely on empirical Hubbard $U$ parameters to describe the ground state, and Heisenberg Hamiltonians for describing magnetic excitations, the methodology developed here probes directly the dynamical spin susceptibility (efficiently evaluated with TDDFPT throught the Liouville-Lanczos approach), and treats the linear variation of the Hubbard augmentation (in itself calculated non-empirically) in full at a self-consistent level. Furthermore, the method satisfies the Goldstone condition without requiring empirical rescaling of the exchange-correlation kernel or explicit enforcement of sum rules, in contrast to existing state-of-the-art techniques. We benchmark the novel computational scheme on prototypical transition-metal monoxides NiO and MnO, showing remarkable agreement with experiments and highlighting the fundamental role of these newly implemented Hubbard corrections. The method holds great promise for describing collective spin excitations in complex materials containing localized electronic states.</p></details> |  |

When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+25 ...</summary><p>5+25 pages; 4 figures</p></details> |

Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in the intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Type II t-J model in charge transfer regime in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00092v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent observations of an 80 K superconductor in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure have attracted significant attention. Recent experiments indicate that La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may be in the charge transfer regime, challenging the previous models based purely on the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. In this study, we propose a low energy model that incorporates doped holes in the oxygen $p$ orbitals. Given that the parent nickel state is in the $3d^{8}$ configuration with a spin-one moment, doped hole only screens it down to spin-half, in contrast to the Zhang-Rice singlet in cuprate. We dub the single hole state as Zhang-Rice spin-half and build an effective model which includes three spin-one states ($d^8$) and two Zhang-Rice spin-half states ($d^8 L$). At moderate pressure around $20$ GPa, the dominated oxygen orbital is an in-plane Wannier orbital with the same lattice symmetry as the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The resulting model reduces to the bilayer type II t-J model previously proposed in the Mott-Hubbard regime. Notably, the hopping between the in-plane $p$ orbitals of the two layers is still suppressed. Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation reveals a pairing dome with the optimal hole doping level at $x=0.4\sim0.5$, distinct from the hole doped cuprate where optimal doping occurs around $x=0.19$. Further increasing pressure initially raises the critical temperature ($T_c$) until reaching an optimal pressure beyond which the $p_z$ orbital of oxygen becomes favorable and superconductivity is diminished. This shift from in-plane $p$ orbital to $p_z$ orbital may elucidate the experimentally observed superconducting dome with varying pressure. As an extension, we also suggest a trilayer version of the type II t-J model as the minimal model for pressured La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, which is distinct from the models in the Mott-Hubbard regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+10 ...</summary><p>7+10 pages, 3+9 figures, 0+1 table</p></details> |

We adopt both periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions along the circumference direction to explore the finite size effect. We study doping levels of $1/6$, $1/8$, and $1/12$ which represent the most interesting region in the phase diagram of electron-doped cuprates. We find that for width-4 and 6 systems, the ground state for fixed doping switches between anti-ferromagnetic Neel state and stripe state under different boundary conditions and with system widths, indicating the presence of large finite size effect in the $t-t'-J$ model. We also have a careful analysis of the $d$-wave pairing correlations which also changes quantitatively with boundary conditions and widths of the system. However, the pairing correlations are enhanced when the system becomes wider for all dopings, suggesting the existence of possible long-ranged superconducting order in the thermodynamic limit. The width-8 results are found to be dependent on the starting state in the DMRG calculation for the kept states we can reach. For width-8 system only Neel (stripe) state can be stabilized in DMRG calculation for $1/12$ ($1/6$) doping, while both stripe and Neel states are stable in the DMRG sweep for $1/8$ doping, regardless of the boundary conditions. These results indicate that $1/8$ doping is likely to lie in the boundary of a phase transition between the Neel phase with lower doping and the stripe phase with higher doping, consistent with the previous study. The sensitivity of ground state on boundary conditions and size observed in this work is similar to that in the $t'$- Hubbard model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

The DFT calculations reveal that both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are active, which suggests a minimal two-orbital model to capture the low-energy physics of this system. In this work, we study a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model within multiband Gutzwiller approximation, and discuss the magnetism as well as the superconductivity over a wide range of the hole doping. Owing to the inter-orbital super-exchange process between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, the induced ferromagnetic coupling within layers competes with the conventional antiferromagnetic coupling, and leads to complicated hole doping dependence for the magnetic properties in the system. With increasing hole doping, the system transfers to A-AFM state from the starting G-AFM state. We also find the inter-layer superconducting pairing of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals dominates due to the large hopping parameter of $d_{z^2}$ along the vertical inter-layer bonds and significant Hund's coupling between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Meanwhile, the G-AFM state and superconductivity state can coexist in the low hole doping regime. To take account of the pressure, we also analyze the impacts of inter-layer hopping amplitude on the system properties.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Such electron incoherence manifests itself most evidently in the non-Drude behavior of the optical response of the system and the anomalous density fluctuation behavior in the long wave length limit. The spectral weight transfer related to such dissipative response, which is absent in conventional Fermi liquid metal, has direct consequence on the dc transport property of the system in the normal state and the superfluid stiffness in the superconducting state. It is found that such electron incoherence remains significant even in the clean limit and at low temperature and thus must be attributed to the strong electron correlation effect in the cuprate superconductors. Here we study such an intrinsic effect in the 2D $t-J$ model through the variational calculation of its optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$. We assume a resonating valence bond ground state as our starting point and find that a significant portion of the total optical spectral weight remains incoherent throughout the phase diagram. The optical absorption is found to extend all the way to an energy of the order of the bare band width. We find that both the total optical weight $\bar{K}$ and the integrated incoherent optical weight $I$ increase monotonically with doping, with their ratio $R_{incoh}=I/\bar{K}$ decreasing monotonically with doping. Our results indicate that the majority part of electron incoherence in the 2D $t-J$ model can be attributed to the electron fractionalization mechanism assumed in such a treatment. We also find that the Drude weight deduced from $D=\bar{K}-I$ scales linearly with hole doping, without any sign of a non-monotonic behavior in the overdoped regime.</p></details> | 11 pages,8 figures |

To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors.

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation.

| **[Superconductivity in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Under Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06450v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity (SC) in the trilayer nickelate compound La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has generated significant interest. In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incommensurate spin-fluctuations and competing pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05254v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K under I4/mmm space group. The susceptibility measurements confirm bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Our research provides a new platform for the investigation of the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in Ruddlesden-Popper trilayer perovskite nickelates.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity. Our findings indicate that interlayer Coulomb interactions are crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, achieving superconductivity in this system currently requires relatively high pressures. In this study, we propose a chemical pressure strategy via Sr substitution to stabilize high-Tc superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient conditions.Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1) at ambient pressure and identify two dynamically stable phases:La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$.Our calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallization of the $\sigma$-bonding bands dominated by Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals-a key feature associated with high-Tc superconductivity, as reported in the high-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Further analysis using tight-binding models shows that the key hopping parameters in La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$ closely resemble those of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, indicating that strong super-exchange interactions between interlayer Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals are preserved. These findings suggest that Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a promising candidate for realizing high-Tcsuperconductivity at ambient pressure.</p></details> |  |

The La(2)$_{\rm a}$ site of the ideal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ is clearly distinguished from the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site close to the local defects. Below 150K, almost half of the intrinsic La(2)$_{\rm a}$ sites are dominated by a finite internal field within the $ab$ plane, while the other half are dominated by zero internal field. The result is fully consistent with the single spin-spinless stripe order of ($\cdots\uparrow\circ\downarrow\circ\uparrow\circ\cdots$), where the reduced Ni magnetic moments are parallel to the $ab$-plane. Even for the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site, the result is also explained within the same model by considering the inhomogeneous internal magnetic fields enhanced around the nearby defects such as oxygen vacancies. These findings provide unambiguous microscopic evidence for the single spin-spinless stripe order below 150 K at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures.

We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03361v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

Here, we demonstrate that exposing WSe$_2$ to chloroform provides simple and stable p-type doping. In monolayer WSe$_2$ transistors with Pd contacts, chloroform increases the maximum hole current by over 100$\times$ (>200 $\mu$A/$\mu$m), reduces $R_\textrm{C}$ to ~2.5 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m, and retains an on/off ratio of $10^{10}$ at room temperature. These improvements persist for over 8 months, survive annealing above 150 {\deg}C, and remain effective down to 10 K, enabling a cryogenic $R_\textrm{C}$ of ~1 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Density functional theory indicates that chloroform strongly physisorbs to WSe$_2$, inducing hole doping with minimal impact on the electronic states between the valence band and conduction band edges. Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy reveal that chloroform intercalates at the WSe$_2$ interface with the gate oxide, contributing to doping stability and mitigating interfacial dielectric disorder. This robust, scalable approach enables high-yield WSe$_2$ transistors with good p-type performance.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p></details> |  |

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |

Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band's natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters; 7 + 9 pages, 4 + 6 figures</p></details> |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively.

In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe and WSe$_2$ nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to $2.2\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for SnSe$_2$ and up to $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for WSe$_2$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Schottky-barrier-height in high-symmetry 2D WSe$_2$: Momentum-space anisotropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11005v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is usually supposed that only low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit anisotropy, here we show that high-symmetry 2D semiconductors can show significant anisotropy in momentum space due to the band structure anisotropy in k-space. The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04131v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p></details> |  |

The spin relaxation is assisted by the emission of acoustic phonons via the bond-length change and deformation potential mechanisms and $1/f$ charge noise. In the perpendicular magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$, we predict a monotonic increase of $T_1^{-1}$ at higher fields where the electron-phonon coupling via the deformation potential plays a dominant role in spin relaxation. We show a less pronounced dip in $T_1^{-1}$ at lower magnetic fields due to the competition between the electron-phonon coupling due to bond-length change and $1/f$ charge noise. Finally, detailed comparisons of the magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation with the existing experiments by Banszerus et al. [Nat. Commun. 13, 3637 (2022)] and G\"achter et al. [PRX Quantum 3, 020343 (2022)] are reported.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

To this end, we employ the inverse graph method, whereby non-zeros of the Green's functions are represented graphically by a segment connecting two atomic sites, to visually signal the existence of a conductance zero as a line that is missing. In rectangular graphene structures the topological properties of the inverse graph determine the existence of two types of Green's function zeros that correspond to absolute conductance cancellations with distinct behavior in the presence of external disorder. We discuss these findings and their potential applications in some particular cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid low-temperature synthesis of graphene-coated SiC substrates for remote and van der Waals epitaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17799v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-conventional epitaxial techniques, such as van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) and remote epitaxy, have attracted substantial attention in the semiconductor research community for their capability to repeatedly produce high-quality free-standing films from a single mother wafer. Successful implementation of these epitaxial techniques depends on creating a robust, uniform two-dimensional (2D) material surface. The conventional method for fabricating graphene on silicon carbide (SiC) is high-temperature graphitization. However, the extremely high temperature required for silicon sublimation (typically above 1500 {\deg}C) causes step-bunching of the SiC surface, forming non-uniform multilayer graphene stripes and an unfavorable surface morphology for epitaxial growth. Here, we developed a wafer-scale graphitization technique that allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at ultra-low temperatures by metal-assisted graphitization (MAG). We found annealing conditions that enable SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation, producing uniform single-crystalline graphene while maintaining the surface morphology of the substrate. The graphene thickness can be controlled by varying the metal thickness or annealing temperature, enabling remote epitaxy or vdWE. We successfully produced freestanding single-crystalline III-N (AlN, GaN) films on graphene/SiC via the 2D material-based layer transfer technique. Our results show that low-temperature graphene synthesis via MAG offers a promising route to producing large-scale ultra-wide bandgap free-standing crystalline membranes.</p></details> |  |

One is the transfer of graphene and the other is the evaporation of alloys onto graphene. The formation energy of a NiFe alloy substrate and the adsorption energy of graphene on the NiFe alloy substrate are investigated by a density functional theory calculations to reveal the difference in the atomic structure of the interface between the two processes. It is found that Ni-rich surfaces are preferable for the bare substrate, whereas Fe surfaces are stable for the graphene adsorbed on the substrate. This result indicates that the composition ratio of the surface layer depends on the interface fabrication process.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Semiregular tessellation of electronic lattices in untwisted bilayer graphene under anisotropic strain gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14007v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a versatile platform for uncovering exotic quantum phases, many of which arise in bilayer systems exhibiting Archimedean tessellation patterns such as triangular, hexagonal, and kagome lattices. Here, we propose a strategy to engineer semiregular tessellation patterns in untwisted bilayer graphene by applying anisotropic epitaxial tensile strain (AETS) along crystallographic directions. Through force-field and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that AETS can induce a rich variety of semiregular tessellation geometries, including truncated hextille, prismatic pentagon, and brick-phase arrangements. The characteristic electronic bands (Dirac and flat bands) of the lattice models associated with these semiregular tessellations are observed near the Fermi level, arising from interlayer interactions generated by the redistribution of specific stacking registries (AB, BA, and SP). Furthermore, the electronic kagome, distorted Lieb, brick-like, and one-dimensional stripe lattices captured in real-space confirm the tunable nature of the semiregular tessellation lattices enabled by AETS. Our study identifies AETS as a promising new degree of freedom in moir\'e engineering, offering a reproducible and scalable platform for exploring exotic electronic lattices in moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free energy barrier and thermal-quantum behavior of sliding bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04532v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multilayer graphene, the stacking order of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity. By applying shear stress, it is possible to induce sliding between different layers, altering the stacking order. Here, focusing on bilayer graphene, we analyze how ionic fluctuations alter the free energy barrier between different stacking equilibria. We calculate the free energy barrier through the state-of-the-art self-consistent harmonic approximation, which can be evaluated at unstable configurations. We find that above 100 K there is a large reduction of the barrier of more than 30% due to thermal vibrations, which significantly improves the agreement between previous first-principles theoretical work and experiments in a single graphite crystal. As the temperature increases, the barrier remains nearly constant up to around 500 K, with a more pronounced decrease only at higher temperatures. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 29 figures |
| **[Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott localization and pseudogap metal in twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17430v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent experimental studies of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) raise a fundamental question: how do we understand Mott localization in a topological band? In this work, we offer a new perspective of Mott physics, which can be generalized to TBG directly in momentum space. In our theory, the Mott gap is understood as from an exciton-like hybridization $\Phi(\mathbf k) c^\dagger(\mathbf k)\psi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical electron $c$ and an ancilla fermion $\psi$. In the conventional Mott insulator of trivial band, the hybridization is $s$-wave with $\Phi(\mathbf k)=\frac{U}{2}$, where $U$ is the on-site Hubbard interaction. On the other hand, the band topology in TBG enforces a topological Mott hybridization with $\Phi(\mathbf k)\sim k_x \pm i k_y$ in a small region around $\mathbf{k}=0$. We dub this new Mott state as topological Mott localization because of the $p\pm ip$ order parameter analogous to the topological superconductor. At $\nu=0$, we find a topological Mott semimetal with a low energy effective theory resembling that of the untwisted bilayer graphene. For $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we show transitions from correlated insulators to Mott semimetals at smaller $U$. In the most intriguing density region $\nu=-2-x$, we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Interestingly, the quasiparticle is primarily formed by ancilla fermion, which we interpret as a composite fermion formed by a hole bound to a particle-hole pair. Our theory offers a unified language to describe the Mott localization in both trivial and topological bands in momentum space, and we anticipate applications in other moir\'e systems with topological Wannier obstruction, such as the twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayer.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 24 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The Hamiltonian of the system possesses this symmetry under certain assumptions. In such a model the multicomponent order parameter can be presented as a $4\times4$ matrix $\hat{Q}$. Using a mean field approximation, we derive a self-consistency equation for $\hat{Q}$. Among possible solutions of the obtained equation there are anomalous quantum Hall states, spin, charge, spin-valley density waves, inter-layer excitonic phases and their combinations. We argue that the proposed approach is a useful tool for classification of the ordered states in AB-BLG. The ordered states of the SU(4)-symmetric model demonstrate extensive degeneracies. The degeneracies can be removed by taking into account the neglected non-SU(4)-symmetric terms, disorder, substrate, as well as other perturbations. The ordered states have varying sensitivity to these factors. This suggests that, for AB-BLG, a ground state ordering type is a non-universal property, susceptible to particulars of extrinsic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, almost identical to published version</p></details> |

We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

Twisting adjacent layers introduces moire patterns that strongly influence the material's electronic and thermal behavior. In twisted graphene systems, the twist angle critically alters phonon transport, leading to reduced thermal conductivity compared to Bernal-stacked configurations. However, experimental investigations into thermal transport in twisted structures remain limited. Here, we study the local thermal properties of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) using Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). We find a reduction in thermal resistance of 0.3 +/- 0.1 x 10^6 K W^-1 compared to untwisted bilayers, attributed to changes in both intrinsic thermal conductivity and the tip-sample interface. These results, supported by analytical modeling, provide new insight into thermal transport mechanisms in twisted 2D systems and offer a pathway toward thermal engineering in twistronic devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intrinsic layer polarization and multi-flatband transport in non-centrosymmetric mixed-stacked multilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12478v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphene multilayers exhibit electronic spectra that depend sensitively on both the number of layers and their stacking order. Beyond trilayer graphene, mixed stacking sequences (alternating Bernal and rhombohedral layers) give rise to multiple coexisting low-energy bands. Here we investigate ABCBC-stacked pentalayer graphene, a less-studied non-centrosymmetric mixed sequence. This stacking can be regarded as an ABC (rhombohedral) trilayer on top of an AB (Bernal) bilayer, so its low-energy band structure contains both a cubic band and a parabolic band that hybridize. In transport measurements, we observe an intrinsic band gap at charge neutrality whose magnitude changes asymmetrically under an applied perpendicular displacement field. This behavior reflects the spontaneous layer polarization inherent to the broken inversion symmetry and mirror symmetry. By tuning the displacement field and carrier density, we drive multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Fermi surface topology and realize Landau levels with different degeneracies arising from the multi-flatband system. Remarkably, a v = -6 quantum Hall state emerges at an exceptionally low magnetic field (~20 mT), indicating the interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and Berry curvatures. Our results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a tunable platform with various broken symmetries and multiple flatbands, suitable for exploring emergent correlated electronic states.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a reactive MLIP for graphene, trained on an extensive dataset generated via \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The model accurately reproduces key mechanical and vibrational properties, including stress-strain behavior, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, and vibrational density of states. Notably, it captures temperature-dependent fracture mechanisms and the emergence of linear acetylenic carbon chains upon tearing. The phonon analysis also reveals the expected quadratic ZA mode and excellent agreement with experimental and DFT benchmarks. Our MLIP scales linearly with system size, enabling simulations of large graphene sheets with \textit{ab initio}-level precision.

Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.</p></details> | 32 pages, 12 figures |

Twist angle, pressure, and strain directly modify the lattice, and thus act as highly effective tuning parameters. Here we examine electrical transport in twisted bilayer graphene subjected to continuous uniaxial strain. Near the magic angle ($\approx 1.1^{\circ}$), devices exhibit a pronounced elastoresistance that depends on band filling and temperature, with a gauge factor more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional metals. In selected doping regimes the elastoresistance exhibits a Curie-Weiss-like temperature divergence. We discuss possible microscopic origins, including nematic fluctuations and enhanced electronic entropy from fluctuating isospin moments. Our work establishes uniaxial strain as a versatile probe of correlated physics in a moir\'e material.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Chiral near-field control of quantum light generation using magneto-optical graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10276v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically explore strategies to actively control photon emission from quantum light sources by leveraging the large magneto-optical response of graphene. The quantum electrodynamic response of graphene -- characterized by the Purcell factor and the Lamb shift of a proximal emitter -- is analyzed for extended two-dimensional sheets, one-dimensional nanoribbons, and zero-dimensional nanodisks, all of which are endowed with an intrinsic chiral near-field response under a static perpendicular magnetic field. Using rigorous semianalytical models of these systems, we reveal that the emission properties can be readily tuned by variations in doping charge carrier density and applied magnetic field strength, both with respect to magnetoplasmon resonances (at infrared frequencies) and Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations (entering telecommunication bands) associated with optical transitions between discrete Landau levels. Localized magnetoplasmons in graphene nanoribbons are predicted to induce large dissymmetry in the spontaneous emission from left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized transitions in a proximal quantum emitter, presenting applications for chiral quantum optical waveguiding. This chiral dissymmetry is further enhanced in gyrotropic graphene nanodisks, signaling that the spatial shaping of near-fields in nanostructured graphene can significantly boost the intrinsic chiral response induced by the magnetic field. These results indicate that magneto-optical graphene constitutes a versatile and highly tunable platform for quantum light generation and manipulation at the nanoscale.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

Accurate simulations of electrons in materials interacting with quantum photon fluctuations of a cavity are crucial for understanding and predicting cavity-induced phenomena. In this article, we develop a non-perturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between electrons and cavity photons in crystalline materials. We apply this theoretical approach to investigate graphene coupled to the vacuum field fluctuations of cavity photon modes with different types of polarizations. The cavity photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, originating from the quantum nature of light, that lead to significant renormalization of the Dirac bands. In contrast to the case of graphene coupled to a classical circularly polarized light field, where a topological Dirac gap emerges, the nonlocal interactions induced by a quantum linearly polarized photon mode give rise to the formation of flat bands and the opening of a topologically trivial Dirac gap. When two symmetric cavity photon modes are introduced, Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the relevant role of nonlocal interactions. These effects disappear in the classical limit for coherent photon modes. This new self-consistent theoretical framework paves the way for the simulation of non-perturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems, and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of novel cavity-induced quantum phenomena.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

By adjusting the carrier density so that the Fermi energy lies in the vicinity of these singularities, recent experiments observe a plethora of highly correlated electronic phases including isospin polarized phases and high-resistance states with non-linear electric transport indicative of a possible Wigner crystal. We perform Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions and allowing for translational and rotational symmetry breaking. We obtain the displacement field vs. carrier density phase diagram which shows isospin polarized metallic phases tracking the Van-Hove singularity in the valence band. Between these metallic phases we observe regions where the ground state is a Wigner crystal. The isospin polarization of the Wigner crystals tracks the isospin polarization of the nearby metallic phases. Depending on whether we have four, three, two or one isospin flavours, we obtain a full, three-quarter, half or quarter Wigner crystal.</p></details> |  |

Herein, we develop a unified bonding entropy model (BEM) to quantitatively characterize the magnetic properties in GNFs within a statistical framework, providing an entropy-based criterion for understanding and predicting bond occupancy numbers and unpaired electron distributions. While non-Kekul\'e systems naturally favor high-spin configurations due to topological frustration, the BEM reveals that even Kekul\'e-type GNFs can exhibit magnetic character when the entropy gain from unpaired electrons outweighs the loss of aromatic stabilization. The model predictions show excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations in terms of spin density distributions and unpaired electron counts. Our results establish bonding entropy as a general guiding principle for designing carbon-based magentic materials with tunable magnetic properties.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 + ...</summary><p>22 + 12 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

This approach allows us to distinguish different subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases and uncover new ones. We focus on the cases where the mixed anomaly exists within the adjacent subsystems. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the power of this method by identifying strong and weak $Z_2^\tau\times Z_2^\sigma$ SSPT phases in a tunable tensor network state. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic $Z_2$ SSPT phase characterized by its degenerate entanglement spectrum. Furthermore, we extend the anomaly indicator to mixed-state density matrices and show that quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetry can persist under both uniform and alternating disorders. This finding establishes a connection between boundary quantum anomalies in pure and mixed states. Our work provides a numerical method to detect quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetries, offering new insights into the study of topological quantum phases.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |

Here we demonstrate the existence of a learning transition, having signatures in the long distance behavior of conditional correlation functions, in the two-dimensional classical Ising model. This transition, which arises when learning local energy densities, extends all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our methods can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</p></details> | <details><summary>all-t...</summary><p>all-to-all model and 2-replica model added</p></details> |
| **[Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of tensor networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19269v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Realization of Color Codes for Quantum Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10693v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color codes are a leading class of topological quantum error-correcting codes with modest error thresholds and structural compatibility with two-dimensional architectures, which make them well-suited for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Here, we propose and analyze a distributed architecture for realizing the (6.6.6) color code. The architecture involves interconnecting patches of the color code housed in different quantum processing units (QPUs) via entangled pairs. To account for noisy interconnects, we model the qubits in the color code as being subject to a bit-flip noise channel, where the qubits on the boundary (seam) between patches experience elevated noise compared to those in the bulk. We investigate the error threshold of the distributed color code under such asymmetric noise conditions by employing two decoders: a tensor-network-based decoder and a recently introduced concatenated Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm. Our simulations demonstrate that elevated noise on seam qubits leads to a slight reduction in threshold for the tensor-network decoder, whereas the concatenated MWPM decoder shows no significant change in the error threshold, underscoring its effectiveness under asymmetric noise conditions. Our findings thus highlight the robustness of color codes in distributed architectures and provide valuable insights into the practical realization of FTQC involving noisy interconnects between QPUs.</p></details> |  |

This entanglement barrier restricts classical simulations and, conversely, underpins the quantum advantage anticipated from future devices. Here we show that, for one-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the spatio-temporal tensor network encoding the evolved wave-function amplitudes can be contracted efficiently along the left-right (spatial) direction. Exploiting this structure, we develop a hybrid Tensor-Network/Monte-Carlo (TN-MC) algorithm that samples the wave function and evaluates expectation values of generic local operators with computational cost that scales only polynomially in time. We benchmark the method on the chaotic transverse-field Ising chain. By tracking the time dependence of the generalised temporal entropies governing the TN contraction, we find that their real part either saturates or grows logarithmically with time, revealing new instances of continuous dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). Our results therefore place the claim that the entanglement barrier can be bypassed with a TN-MC blend on firm theoretical footing.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures. comments welcome</p></details> |

In this work, we explore their connections from a quantum resource perspective on simulating $UOU^\dag$ with $O$ an arbitrary operator ranging from pure state density matrices to Pauli operators. For the tensor network approach, we show that its complexity, quantified by entanglement, is governed by the interplay of two other types of quantum resources, coherence and magic. Crucially, which one has the predominant influence on entanglement is elucidated by what we term the time entanglement of $O$. As time entanglement increases, the dominant resource shifts from coherence to magic. Numerical experiments are conducted to support this claim. For the stabilizer formalism approach, we propose an operator stabilizer formalism to enable its application to arbitrary $O$, whose complexity always relies on magic. The operator stabilizer formalism is also powerful than the standard one for simulating some quantum circuits with special structures. Therefore, as the time entanglement increases, the governing resources between the two approaches change from being uncorrelated to highly correlated.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+11 ...</summary><p>7+11 pages; 3+1 figures</p></details> |

Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates this design process, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise, severely impacting performance. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, a scalable framework that combines tensor network (TN) methods with RL for designing quantum circuits. By warm-starting the architecture search with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits, accelerating convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces function evaluations by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to $98\%$, and achieves up to $50\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems-far exceeding the $<1\%$ rates of baseline approaches. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of up to 8-qubit. These advancements establish TensorRL-QAS as a promising candidate for a scalable and efficient quantum circuit discovery protocol on near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be available soon!

The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry exploited. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures and 1 table; add more explanations for TNRG and details of the numerical calculations</p></details> |

A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis: 150 pages, 54 figures</p></details> |

We optimize the algorithm with tensor networks in one and two dimensions. The optimization has two stages. In stage one, a shallow translationally-invariant circuit is optimized in an infinite lattice. In stage two, the infinite-lattice gate sequence is used as a starting point for a finite lattice where it remains optimal in the bulk. The prepared state requires optimization only at its boundary, within a healing length from lattice edges, and the gate sequence needs to be modified only within the causal cone of the boundary. We test the procedure in the 1D and 2D quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point employing, respectively, the matrix product state (MPS) and the pair-entangled projected state (PEPS). At the boundary already the infinite-lattice sequence turns out to provide a more accurate state than in the bulk.</p></details> | 8 pages |

A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.</p></details> |  |

Central to this framework is the introduction of magic holes, a topological feature that captures the global source of computational hardness in simulating quantum systems. Unlike conventional measures, the complexity of QCS is governed by the topological entanglement entropy associated with these magic holes. We show that Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of magic holes and thus efficiently simulable within our model. To capture the interaction structure of magic holes, we define a topological tensor network representation and develop novel skein relations and reduction algorithms to simplify circuit representations. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of classical simulations and provides a unified explanation for the tractability of various known quantum circuit classes.

Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures, Mathematica codes accompanying this paper are available at https://github.com/lagrenge94/Mathematica-codes-for-Hopf-algebras-and-solvable-unitary-circuits</p></details> |

We study a Fermi Hubbard model with altermagnetic order arising from the spin-anisotropic hopping near half-filling using constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo.

We find that increasing anisotropy suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and significantly enhances effective $d$-wave pairing correlations. Our results demonstrate a doping-free route to unconventional superconductivity mediated by short-range spin fluctuations in an altermagnetic background.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03882v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+15 ...</summary><p>8+15 pages, 3+7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating many-body stabilizer Rényi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146v3)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling \emph{reduced Pauli strings} within a \emph{reduced configuration space}, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. We first isolate the free energy part in $2$-SRE, which is a trivial term. Notably, at quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the \emph{characteristic function} contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, analyzing the volume-law correction to SRE reveals a discontinuity tied to criticalities, suggesting that it is more informative than the full-state magic. For conformal critical points, we claim it could reflect nonlocal magic residing in correlations. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm of quantum Monte Carlo to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324v6)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a quantum Monte Carlo scheme capable of extracting large-scale data of R\'enyi entanglement entropy (EE) with high precision and low technical barrier. Instead of directly computing the ratio of two partition functions within different space-time manifolds, we obtain them separately via a reweight-annealing scheme and connect them from the ratio of a reference point. The incremental process can thus be designed along a path of real physical parameters within this framework, and all intermediates are meaningful EEs corresponding to these parameters. In a single simulation, we can obtain many multiples ($\sim \beta L^d$, d is the space dimension) of EEs, which has been proven to be powerful for determining phase transition points and critical exponents. Additionally, we introduce a formula to calculate the derivative of EE without resorting to numerical differentiation from dense EE data. This formula only requires computing the difference of energies in different space-time manifolds. The calculation of EE and its derivative becomes much cheaper and simpler in our scheme. We then demonstrate the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points, critical exponents, and various phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10358v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities in an extended Hubbard model on honecycomb lattice incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \( t'' \). Using quantum Monte Carlo methods, we identify a crossover between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations near higher-order Van Hove singularities filling, where \( t'' \) enhances ferromagnetic correlations below while suppressing antiferromagnetic fluctuations toward half-filling. At low doping, \( f_n \)-wave pairing dominates, amplified by higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states. Remarkably, despite general suppression of \( f_n \)-wave pairing by increasing next-nearest neighbor hopping \( t' \) and \( t'' \), a critical \( t'' = 0.15 \) triggers anomalous enhancement via higher-order Van Hove singularities renormalization at a fix $t'$. The nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions \( V \) suppress superconducting correlation, which exhibiting sign-independent suppression proportional to \( |V| \). These results highlight the interplay of higher-order Van Hove singularities-driven electronic structure, magnetic fluctuations, and pairing symmetry competition in electron correlated systems.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry of Tilted Non-Hermitian Dirac Semimetals at Quantum Criticality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18621v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dirac materials, hosting linearly dispersing quasiparticles at low energies, exhibit an emergent Lorentz symmetry close to a quantum critical point (QCP) separating semimetallic state from a strongly-coupled gapped insulator or superconductor. This feature appears to be quite robust even in the open Dirac systems coupled to an environment, featuring non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac fermions: close to a strongly coupled QCP, a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry emerges in terms of a unique terminal velocity for both the fermion and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations, while the system can either retain non-Hermiticity or completely decouple from the environment thus recovering Hermiticity as an emergent phenomenon. We here show that such a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry can emerge at the quantum criticality even when the NH Dirac Hamiltonian includes a tilt term at the lattice scale. As we demonstrate by performing a leading order $\epsilon=3-d$ expansion close to $d=3$ upper critical dimension of the theory, a tilt term becomes irrelevant close to the QCP separating the NH Dirac semimetal and a gapped (insulating or superconducting) phase. Such a behavior also extends to the case of the linear-in-momentum non-tilt perturbation, introducing the velocity anisotropy for the Dirac quasiparticles, which also becomes irrelevant at the QCP. These predictions can be numerically tested in quantum Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the NH Hubbard-like models hosting low-energy NH tilted Dirac fermions.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures, published version</p></details> |
| **[High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20009v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). Here, $N$ is the total number of sites and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature or projection length. To tackle this problem, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. We benchmark the developed algorithm by calculating the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The obtained phase diagram including Fermi surface and Goldstone modes validates the correctness of the algorithm. Remarkably, our method shows the high-efficiency with respect to the existing algorithms, while keeping the high computation precision. We proceed to apply this algorithm to explore the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy and particularly its derivative at Gross-Neveu criticality. Our results elucidate that such critical behavior can be quantified by the correlation length exponent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Entanglement islands in 1D and 2D lattices with defects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02612v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the spatial structure of quantum entanglement in one- and two-dimensional lattice systems containing structural defects, using the Time-Dependent Quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method. By constructing reduced density matrices from ensembles of guide waves, we resolve spatial variations in both Coulomb-mediated entanglement and coherence without requiring full many-body wavefunctions. This approach reveals localized regions, entanglement islands, where quantum correlations are enhanced or suppressed due to the presence of vacancies or interaction inhomogeneities. In 1D systems, entanglement tends to concentrate near defects, while in 2D we observe bridge-like and radially symmetric domains. Our results demonstrate that TDQMC offers a scalable and physically transparent framework for real-space quantum information analysis, with implications for quantum materials, entanglement-based sensing, and coherent state engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08397v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Contemporary tensor network approaches to gapless and topological phases in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00106v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of numerically efficient computational methods has facilitated in depth studies of various correlated phases of matter including critical and topological phases. A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.</p></details> |  |

Tuning the transverse field $h$ and the dilution $p$, the quantum phase diagram of both models is explored. Both quantum phase diagrams show long-range order for small $h$ and small $p$. The ordered phase of each is separated from the disordered (quantum) Griffiths phase by second-order phase transitions on two critical lines touching at a multi-critical point. Using Binder ratios we locate quantum critical points with high accuracy. The order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the average correlation-length exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ are determined along the critical lines and at the multi-critical points for the first time via finite-size scaling. We find three internally consistent sets of critical exponents and compare them with potentially connected universality classes. The quantum Griffiths phase in the vicinity of the phase transition lines is analyzed through the local susceptibility. Our results indicate that activated scaling occurs not only at the percolation transition, but also at the phase transition line for $p$ smaller than the percolation threshold $p_c$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18937v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave function in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo description of correlated electrons in two-dimensional FeSe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05883v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic correlation effects on the structural properties of double-layer FeSe are studied using variation and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods. The Slater-Jastrow many-body wavefunction with two different forms for the homogeneous two-body pair-correlation term is used. The ground-state energy of the system is obtained at the thermodynamic limit using two different trial wave functions called JDFT and JSD. Only the Jastrow factor is fully optimized in the JDFT wave function, while the Slater determinant comes from the density functional approximation. In the JSD trial wave function, the Slater determinant and the Jastrow factor are fully optimized simultaneously. We calculated the VMC and DMC energies as a function of interlayer separation for two different in-plane iron-iron bond lengths. Our QMC results indicate that the optimized interlayer separation decreases with increasing iron-iron bond length, driven by stretch. We found that a three- to two-dimensional phase transition increases the electron-electron correlation effects and shifts the system from moderately correlated to strongly correlated. The value of correlation energy implies that the Hubbard $U$ value, which is widely used in DFT+U calculations, for two-dimensional FeSe is larger than its value in bulk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo study of the quasiparticle effective mass of the two-dimensional uniform electron liquid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05879v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real-space variation quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to calculate the quasiparticle energy bands and the quasiparticle effective mass of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic two-dimensional uniform electron liquid (2D-UEL)\@. The many-body finite-size errors are minimized by performing simulations for three system sizes with the number of electrons $N=146$, 218, and 302 for paramagnetic and $N=151$ for ferromagnetic systems. We consider 2D-UEL to be within the metallic density range $1\leq r_s \leq 5$. The VMC and DMC results predict that the quasiparticle effective mass $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL at high density $r_s=1$ is very close to 1, suggesting that effective mass renormalization due to electron-electron interaction is negligible. We find that $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL obtained by the VMC and DMC methods increases by $r_s$ but with different slopes. Our VMC and DMC results for ferromagnetic 2D-UEL indicate that $m^*$ decreases rapidly by reducing the density due to the strong suppression of the electron-electron interaction.</p></details> |  |

However, the phase diagram and excitations as functions of twist angle and permittivity are still largely unknown. Here, via a newly developed momentum-space continuous-field quantum Monte Carlo method fully taking into account long-ranged Coulomb interactions and flat bands' quantum metrics with system sizes that were not accessible before, we show that charge-neutral TBG realizes an angle-tuned quantum phase transition from a gapped Kramers intervalley coherence (KIVC) state to a Dirac semimetal with critical angles around 1.2$\deg$. In single-particle spectra we demonstrate the evolution of a minimum gap at $\Gamma$ at the magic angle and towards touching points at Brillouin zone corners as the angle increases. The free energy and KIVC order parameter show that the transition belongs to fermionic Gross-Neveu criticality, and is robust upon varying the permittivity or the interlayer hopping.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

Previous studies have focused mainly on periodic arrangements of the optical tweezers, which host various spatially ordered magnetic phases. Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state of quantum Ising models for amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms. These models are designed to feature well-controlled local structural properties in the absence of long-range order. Notably, by determining the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, we find evidence of a quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a spin-glass phase. The magnetic structure factor indicates short-range isotropic antiferromagnetic correlations. For the feasible sizes, the spin-overlap distribution features a nontrivial structure with two broad peaks and a sizable weight at zero overlap. The comparison against results for the clean kagome lattice, which features local structural properties similar to those of our amorphous arrays, highlights the important role of the absence of long-range structural order of the underlying array. Our findings indicate a route to experimentally implement the details of a Hamiltonian which hosts a quantum spin-glass phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Without this proviso, the number of complex amplitudes would grow exponentially with the number of qubits and would eventually overwhelm the memory and processing power of a classical computer. However, the action of Clifford group elements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without resorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow an extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that can be studied in this way. The method is also illustrated using the Transverse-Field Ising model.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures.

Because of their localized orbitals, the electronic states are often strongly correlated, which has led to a proliferation of quantum embedding techniques to treat this correlation. In these techniques, a weakly correlated reference such as density functional theory is used to treat most of the one-particle states, while certain states are singled out as an active space to be treated with an effective interaction. We assess these techniques in the context of an iron defect in aluminum nitride by referencing to a fully correlated quantum Monte Carlo description. This comparison allows us to have access to detailed information about the many-body wave functions, which are not available experimentally. We find that errors in the underlying density functional theory calculation, and thus choice of the active space, lead to qualitatively incorrect excited states from the embedded model. These errors are extremely difficult to recover from by adding corrections such as double counting or many-body perturbation theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables; includes Supplementary Material (15 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables)</p></details> |

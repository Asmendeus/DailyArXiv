| **[Balanced cross-Kerr coupling for superconducting qubit readout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09010v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dispersive readout, the standard method for measuring superconducting qubits, is limited by multiphoton qubit-resonator processes arising even at moderate drive powers. These processes degrade performance, causing dispersive readout to lag behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. In this work, we propose a novel readout method, termed "junction readout". Junction readout leverages the nonperturbative cross-Kerr interaction resulting from coupling a qubit and a resonator via a Josephson junction. Furthermore, by adding a capacitive coupling in parallel to the junction, Purcell decay can be suppressed without the need for a Purcell filter. We also show that junction readout is more robust against deleterious multiphoton processes, and offers greater flexibility for resonator frequency allocation. Crucially, junction readout achieves superior performance compared to dispersive readout while maintaining similar hardware overhead. Numerical simulations show that junction readout can achieve fidelities exceeding $99.99\%$ in under $30$ ns, making it a promising alternative for superconducting qubit readout with current hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting diode effect in fractal superconductors: fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau theory for Josephson junctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02187v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for nonreciprocal superconducting transport in Josephson junctions formed by fractal superconductors or superconducting media with nonlocal correlations, separated by a noncentrosymmetric normal layer. We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Developments in superconducting erasure qubits for hardware-efficient quantum error correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02183v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers are inherently noisy, and a crucial challenge for achieving large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing is to implement quantum error correction. A promising direction that has made rapid recent progress is to design hardware that has a specific noise profile, leading to a significantly higher threshold for noise with certain quantum error correcting codes. This Perspective focuses on erasure qubits, which enable hardware-efficient quantum error correction, by concatenating an inner code built-in to the hardware with an outer code. We focus on implementations of dual-rail encoded erasure qubits using superconducting qubits, giving an overview of recent developments in theory and simulation, and hardware demonstrators. We also discuss the differences between implementations; near-term applications using quantum error detection; and the open problems for developing this approach towards early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-Lattice Relaxation in Two-Dimensional Superconducting BKT Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13486v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional superconductors undergo a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by vortex-antivortex unbinding, yet experimental signatures beyond transport remain limited. Here, we show that the spin-lattice relaxation rate provides a direct probe of this transition. In a 2-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor, $1/T_1T$ develops a Hebel-Slichter-like peak around $T_{\rm{BKT}}$, originating from the emergence of coherence peaks in the density of states, while no peak appears at the pair formation scale $T_{\rm{BCS}}$. We further extend our analysis to the $d$-wave superconductor. Our results highlight spin-lattice relaxation rate as a sensitive tool to detect the superconducting BKT transition and open routes to exploring its manifestation in unconventional pairing states.</p></details> | 4 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Impact of Pressure and Apical Oxygen Vacancies on Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14324v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has recently emerged as a promising system for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the fate of the superconducting properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Multiple nodal superconducting phases and order-parameter evolution in pressurized UTe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01843v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin-triplet superconductivity (SC) offers a unique avenue for realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes and thus the fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, and has attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle Δ_{z}\rangle/\langleΔ_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>21+14...</summary><p>21+14 pages, 5+9 figures, 1+1 tables</p></details> |
| **[Evidence of anisotropic bulk superconductivity in disorder-induced ZrTe$_{3-x}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01815v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition-metal trichalcogenides distinguish themselves from other two-dimensional materials in nanoscience and materials science due to their remarkable range of intrinsic properties, including various electronic, optical, and magnetic behaviors. Here, we report a comprehensive study of superconductivity in disordered ZrTe$_{3-x}$ ($x$ = 0.2) with suppressed charge density wave. We observe a type-II bulk anisotropic superconductivity with a superconducting transition at $T_c$ = 3.59(4) \si{K}. Angle-dependent upper critical field measurements and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition confirm the inherent quasi-two-dimensional nature of superconductivity in this disordered system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Demonstration of Discrete-Time Quantum Walks and Observation of Topological Edge States in a Superconducting Qutrit Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01759v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum walk serves as a versatile tool for universal quantum computing and algorithmic research. However, the implementation of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) with superconducting circuits is still constrained by some limitations such as operation precision, circuit depth and connectivity. With improved hardware efficiency by using superconducting qutrits (three-level systems), we experimentally demonstrate a scalable DTQW in a superconducting circuit, observing the ballistic spreading of quantum walk in a qutrit chain. The usage of qutrits in our implementation allows hardware efficiently encoding of the walker position and the coin degree of freedom. By exploiting the flexibility and intrinsic symmetries of qutrit-based DTQWs, we successfully prepare two topological phases in the chain. For the first time, particle-hole-symmetry-protected edge states, bounded at the interface between these two topological phases, are observed in the superconducting platform. Measured parameter dependencies further validate the properties of edge states. The scalability and gate-control compatibility of the demonstrated DTQWs enable a versatile tool for superconducting quantum computing and quantum simulation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital Separation of Charge Order and Superconductivity in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01643v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a combined x-ray absorption (XAS) and oxygen $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge order in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.125$) under uniaxial $c$-axis pressure. We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Phase transitions in a three dimensional $U(1) \times U(1)$ lattice London superconductor: Metallic superfluid and charge-4e superconducting states](https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3311v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a three-dimensional lattice $U(1) \times U(1)$ and $[U(1)]^N$ superconductors in the London limit, with individually conserved condensates. The $U(1) \times U(1)$ problem, generically, has two types of intercomponent interactions of different characters. First, the condensates are interacting via a minimal coupling to the same fluctuating gauge field. A second type of coupling is the direct dissipationless drag represented by a local intercomponent current-current coupling term in the free energy functional. In this work, we present a study of the phase diagram of a $U(1) \times U(1)$ superconductor which includes both of these interactions. We study phase transitions and two types of competing paired phases which occur in this general model: (i) a metallic superfluid phase (where there is order only in the gauge invariant phase difference of the order parameters), (ii) a composite superconducting phase where there is order in the phase sum of the order parameters which has many properties of a single-component superconductor but with a doubled value of electric charge. We investigate the phase diagram with particular focus on what we call ``preemptive phase transitions.'' These are phase transitions unique to multicomponent condensates with competing topological objects. A sudden proliferation of one kind of topological defects may come about due to a fluctuating background of topological defects in other sectors of the theory. For $U(1) \times U(1)$ theory with unequal bare stiffnesses where components are coupled by a non-compact gauge field only, we study how this scenario leads to a merger of two $U(1)$ transitions into a single $U(1) \times U(1)$ discontinuous phase transition. We also report a general form of vortex-vortex bare interaction potential and possible phase transitions in an $N$-component London superconductor with individually conserved condensates.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: u...</summary><p>v2: updated with the version published in Physical Review B.

| **[Electronic structures and superconductivity in Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08194v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% ($\sim$ 2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Isotropic Superconductivity in Room-temperature Superconductor LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01398v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$ represents a milestone in the quest for room-temperature superconductivity, yet the microscopic mechanism underlying its superior performance remains unclear. Through a comprehensive revisit of theoretical calculations, we uncover a pivotal transition from the anisotropic two-gap superconductivity of LaH$_{10}$ to the isotropic single-gap superconductivity in LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$ upon the introduction of scandium, thereby enhancing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$). This enhancement is rooted in a critical dual role of Sc $3d$ electrons: i) the Sc-derived Jahn-Teller effect promotes hydrogen metallization via the elongation of specific interlayer H-H bonds and enhances electron-phonon coupling (EPC) through the softening of associated phonon modes; ii) Sc $3d$ electrons reconstruct the electronic structure into an MgB$_{2}$-like configuration, generating novel Sc-H-Sc $σ$- and $π$-bonding states with EPC strengths comparable to LaH$_{10}$. Crucially, the pronounced hybridization between Sc and the hydrogen cages effectively unifies these two contributions on the Fermi surface. This Sc-induced gap unification bridges the high-EPC H-H states with widespread Sc-H states, establishing an isotropic single-gap nature with a large overall EPC strength. Our findings identify this Sc-induced gap unification as the fundamental mechanism for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$, offering a theoretical blueprint for the future design of superior superconducting hydrides.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Distant Entanglement Generation between Magnon and Superconducting Qubits in Magnon-Mediated Hybrid Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01394v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an efficient two-stage protocol for generating distant entanglement in a magnon-mediated hybrid quantum system, where magnons serve dual roles as both interaction mediators and qubits. This integrated design reduces the physical component count while leveraging the inherent advantages of magnons, such as their strong coupling via magnetic dipole interactions, low dissipation, and high integrability. In our setup, a superconducting resonator interfaces between a local superconducting qubit (SQ) and a local magnonic system (QM1), which is waveguide-coupled to a remote magnonic system (QM2). The protocol comprises two stages: (i) deterministic Bell-state generation between the SQ and QM1 using shortcuts to adiabaticity, and (ii) coherent state transfer to QM2 via engineered Hamiltonian dynamics. This adiabatic characteristic enhances robustness against environmental dissipation. Numerical simulations under realistic noise conditions confirm strong resilience to decoherence, achieving fidelity $F > 0.90$ and negativity $\mathcal{N}_2 > 0.40$. These results establish the protocol as a scalable and practical building block for distributed quantum networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tripling of the Superconducting Critical Current Density in BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ Retained After Pressure Release](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01328v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting performance is tunable not only via chemical modification or defect engineering, but also through external parameters such as pressure, though this method remains less readily accessible. In this work, we study how compression influences vortex dynamics and critical currents in an iron-based superconductor. Specifically, we perform magnetization measurements using an off-the-shelf pressure cell to investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressures up to 1.08 GPa on the magnetic properties of BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.62}$P$_{0.38}$)$_2$ crystals across a range of temperatures $T$ and magnetic fields $H$. Although these pressures minimally affect the superconducting critical temperature, they produce a clear increase in the critical current density $J_c(T,H)$, a pronounced reduction in the rate of thermally activated vortex motion $S(T,H)$, and can change the dominant vortex pinning mechanism. Furthermore, the effects of pressure are irreversible: after pressurization and subsequent release at room temperature, the crystals retain their enhanced critical current densities. The second magnetization peak vanishes at 22 K after the pressure cycle, which we attribute to a transition from predominantly $δκ$ pinning to a mixed mechanism of $δT_c$ and surface pinning. Lastly, a threefold increase in $J_c$ and more than 40\% reduction in $S$ at 8~K and 0.5~T was achieved after $1-2$ pressure cycles. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of pressure cycling for improving $J_c$, which may offer a simpler alternative to approaches such as chemical doping or the introduction of artificial pinning centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strain-triggered high-temperature superconducting transition in two-dimensional carbon allotrope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01100v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving non-superconducting materials into a superconducting state through specific modulation is a key focus in the field of superconductivity. Pressure is a powerful method that can switch a three-dimensional (3D) material between non-superconducting and superconducting states. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, strain engineering plays a similar role to pressure. However, purely strain-induced superconductivity in 2D systems remains exceedingly scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K. This work not only provides a notable example of controlling metal-superconductor transition in 2D system just via strain, but also sets a new record of superconducting transition temperature for 2D elemental superconductors.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in CuxTiSe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00723v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay among electronic nematicity, charge density wave, and superconductivity in correlated electronic systems has induced extensive research interest. Here, we discover the existence of nematic fluctuations in TiSe2 single crystal and investigate its evolution with Cu intercalation. It is observed that the elastoresistivity coefficient mEg exhibits a divergent temperature dependence following a Curie-Weiss law at high temperature. Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized. Further intercalation of Cu leads to the sign change of T* and the suppression of superconductivity. These results strongly indicate that nematic phase transition may play a vital role in enhancing superconductivity in CuxTiSe2. Therefore, CuxTiSe2 provides a unique material platform to explore the nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Rev. B 98, 235109 (2018)] with the random hopping disorder that breaks the flat-band degeneracy. Through Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field calculations, we find that the superfluid weight is much more robust under the flat-band-preserving disorder, while the system eventually undergoes a transition to an insulator as disorder becomes strong enough. The almost linear interaction-dependence of the superfluid weight in the weak coupling limit found with the flat-band-preserving disorder confirms the persistent flat-band signature, whereas the exponential behavior of a dispersive-band character arises with the random hopping counterpart. In addition, in the exact diagonalization of the one-particle density matrix, we identify an occupation spectrum structure attributed to the flat-band states, demonstrating the connection between the resilient flat band and the enhanced robustness of superconductivity.</p></details> |  |

All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into a superconducting-like inductive response. This assignment was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report an experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties, which has so far been elusive due to the high equilibrium reflectivity and the need to evaluate minute changes in the optical response. We report the appearance of a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2Δ\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, both consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</p></details> | 42 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Chip scale superconducting quantum gravimeter based on a SQUID transmon mechanical resonator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00425v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise gravitational measurements are vital for geophysics and inertial navigation, but current platforms struggle to combine absolute accuracy with high-bandwidth tracking. We address this challenge with a chip-scale superconducting gravimeter that couples a flux-tunable transmon qubit to a high-$Q$ mechanical resonator. We embed the mechanical element inside the qubit's SQUID loop. This allows us to exploit the Josephson potential's nonlinearity, creating a motion-dependent inductance that maps gravitational displacement onto the qubit's geometric phase. Using a stroboscopic measurement protocol, we suppress mechanical decoherence at revival times. This yields a predicted sensitivity of $10^2\,\mathrm{nGal}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, approaching the performance of atomic sensors but with kilohertz-rate sampling. With electrical {in situ} tunability and SI traceability via microwave spectroscopy, this architecture offers a practical route to high-speed, quantum-limited on-chip gravimetry.</p></details> | 16figs |

By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assembling a Bose-Hubbard superfluid from tweezer-controlled single atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24374v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating triangle Hofstadter-Hubbard model with fermionic projected entangled simplex states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21503v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The triangular Hofstadter-Hubbard model, realizable in moiré bilayers, provides a fertile ground for discovering correlated topological states. We investigate this model in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fermionic infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS) approach, which offers direct access to the stability of the emergent correlated states at the thermodynamic limit. Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility. Finite-correlation-length scaling of the magnetization reveals a transition into a large-$U$ $120^\circ$ Néel phase at $U_{c_2} \approx 22.5$. Remarkably, with finite hole doping $δ$, we identify a uniform superconducting state with a finite pairing amplitude, whose order parameter displays a nearly universal phase winding across the $U$-$δ$ phase diagram.

Such phase diagrams are traditionally constructed numerically, but we argue that, by using asymptotic techniques, it is possible to obtain analytic formulas approximating the curves separating the different phases to very high accuracy. To illustrate the new method, we apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at zero temperature. This yields formulas for the Hartree-Fock phase boundaries that agree with, but also improve on, earlier numerical results. In particular, our results provide the first rigorous proof of the existence of mixed phases in this model.</p></details> | 59 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Comparing Hubbard parameters from linear-response theory and Hartree-Fock-based approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16803v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06284v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical state-vector simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to ${6\times 6}$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including different on-site electron-electron interaction strengths and magnetic flux values, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons (charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation), dynamical symmetry-breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled background state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that meaningful programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now feasible on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p></details> | 94 pages, 76 figures |

In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</p></details> |  |

It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $Δ$, vanishes like $\exp(-2π\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U>0$ and $t>0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages; v2: shorter proof of main result</p></details> |

We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 Main text figures, 9 Supplementary figures</p></details> |

By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly-interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled approach for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages with 2 figures; to appear in PRA</p></details> |

Specifically, we apply this method to the driven Bose-Hubbard chain to illustrate the competition between coherent driving, hopping, and on-site interactions. Unlike the asymptotic high-dimensional statistics regime in random systems, here the randomness emerges dynamically from the interplay between the driving field $F$ and the nonlinearity $U$. We reveal the relation between the UV cutoff of the effective momentum space (related to the particle number truncation) and the system's chaotic behavior (SYK-like features). The inverse of the effective Hilbert space cutoff, acting as an essential degree-of-freedom (DOF) other than the bosonic modes, relates to the distribution and statistical variance of the interaction-induced coupling. By mapping the 1D chain to a high-dimensional feature space via a Gaussian-based self-attention mechanism, we replace the direct diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian with a predictive algorithm where the flavor number $O(M)$ is determined by the local potential difference generated by the Kerr non-linearity $\frac{1}{2}U$. The resulting system follows statistics intermediate between the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), contingent on the ratio $U/J$. Our algorithm allows for the automatic optimization and prediction of the resulting many-body spectrum to arbitrary accuracy, revealing non-Fermi liquid-like behavior in the strongly interacting bosonic phase.</p></details> |  |

Using Jordan-Wigner transformation, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the subsystem Loschmidt echo, and systematically investigate how its properties vary with subsystem size. It is found that when the subsystem is sufficiently large, it exhibits logarithmic divergence identical to that of the full system Loschmidt echo, yielding a critical exponent of zero. We also obtain the required subsystem size and temporal resolution for detecting dynamical quantum phase transitions using the subsystem Loschmidt echo. It is expected that the present results provide a reliable foundation for further experimental investigations.</p></details> |  |

Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $ν=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $ν=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $ν=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figures |

Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal superconductivity(SC) occurs at a moderate imbalance. Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. In addition, the SC can be possibly hosted by a single layer, which is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |

Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order.

In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($δ\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity in a bilayer $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07545v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $δ= 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $δ= 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the fate of the superconducting properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Electronic Nematicity Revealed by Polarized Ultrafast Spectroscopy in Bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01702v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a polarized ultrafast pump-probe study of the normal-state electronic dynamics in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals at ambient pressure. While both nickelates exhibit density-wave (DW) transitions accompanied by the opening of a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck, their electronic responses display strikingly different symmetry properties. La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ maintains an isotropic optical response across the entire temperature range. In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K. The presence of macroscopic electronic anisotropy in the bilayer system, and its absence in the trilayer system, suggests an intimate relation between electronic nematic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ that worth for deeper explorations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% ($\sim$ 2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures.

Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\rm DW} \approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Magnetism of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22371v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the magnetic ground state of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates is crucial, as these materials exhibit superconductivity under high pressure and host competing electronic orders that may play a key role in the pairing mechanism. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $ΔT_{SDW} \simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p></details> |  |

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\it within} the $γ$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Using fully self-consistent DFT+$U$ calculations on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures, we identify that intrinsic hole doping via interfacial Sr interdiffusion is the decisive factor in stabilizing the metallic state. Our 1-unit-cell model accurately reproduces the ARPES-observed Fermi surface, particularly the critical Ni-$d_{z^2}$ derived $γ$ hole pocket, which originates exclusively from the interface-proximal bilayer. Furthermore, comparative tight-binding analysis suggests that the reduced superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in thin films stems from the synergistic suppression of the electronic density of states (DOS) and vertical superexchange coupling ($J \perp Z$). These findings highlight that interface engineering plays a critical role beyond simple strain imposition in modulating nickelate orbital physics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional Hubbard model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p></details> |  |

A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+3 ...</summary><p>10+3 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, supplemental material</p></details> |

In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $χ({\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the Néel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping).</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.</p></details> |  |

Yet, despite intense recent activity, we lack experimentally testable protocols for distinguishing between different pairing scenarios. In this Letter, we construct a minimal two-band model that reproduces the Fermi-surface topology observed in recent ARPES measurements and DFT calculations, and we analyze superconductivity arising from two distinct pairing mechanisms. We show that these mechanisms yield sharply different responses to an applied perpendicular electric field. Thus, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers the unique opportunity to cleanly distinguish between different pairing scenarios. Finally, we propose three concrete experimental proposals designed to distinguish these scenarios and thereby identify the pairing mechanism most relevant to the real material.</p></details> |  |

Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.</p></details> |  |

Our results reveal two coexisting density waves that can be selectively manipulated with light. We directly identify a spin-density wave (SDW) with electronic nematicity emerging below $T_{\rm SDW}$ $\approx$ 140 K by measuring its spin dynamics, and discover a distinct, nonmagnetic charge order appearing below $T_{\rm DW}$ $\approx$ 115 K. The central finding is the demonstration of differential optical control: the charge order is fragile, completely suppressed by a pump fluence of approximately 40 $μ$J/cm$^2$, while the SDW is remarkably robust, persisting to 200 $μ$J/cm$^2$. This work establishes a clear hierarchy in the stability of competing electronic orders and provides a powerful method for disentangling their interplay in quantum materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, including 5 pages and 4 figures of Supplementary Material, accepted for publication in Phys.

The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle Δ_{z}\rangle/\langleΔ_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>21+14...</summary><p>21+14 pages, 5+9 figures, 1+1 tables</p></details> |

Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity are observed in the longitudinal elastic mode $c_{11}$ for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$ from $b$-axis. We confirm an upper critical field of $H_{\rm c2}\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and bulk superconductivity which survives up to $T\approx 2$ K for fields above the metamagnetic transition. The $c_{11}$ mode has propagation and displacement vectors along the $a$-axis, and for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$, this mode is sensitive to the elasticity of the vortex lattice. The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material included</p></details> |

Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures (including SI)</p></details> |

We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $μ_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted as regular article</p></details> |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

We show that the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit $H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to $\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry. It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.</p></details> | 41pages, 14figures |

In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $χ^b > χ^a > χ^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $χ^a > χ^c > χ^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |

In ultra-clean single crystals, we identify a field-induced phase transition within the superconducting state at 5.6 T, driven by metamagnetism. This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.</p></details> |  |

At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($κ$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$κ$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $κ$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</p></details> | 21 pages. 17 figures |

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18564v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982v4)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum XY model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two-dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moiré twisted bi-layer graphene and bilayer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear-in-temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those caused by Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature-independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln ω_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p></details> | 65 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Artificial electrostatic crystals: a new platform for creating correlated quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12769v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electronic properties of solids are determined by the crystal structure and interactions between electrons, giving rise to a variety of collective phenomena including superconductivity, strange metals and correlated insulators. The mechanisms underpinning many of these collective phenomena remain unknown, driving interest in creating artificial crystals which replicate the system of interest while allowing precise control of key parameters. Here we demonstrate the formation of highly tunable artificial crystals by superimposing a periodic electrostatic potential on the 2D electron gas in an ultra-shallow (25 nm deep) GaAs quantum well. The 100 nm period artificial crystal is identified by the formation of a new bandstructure, different from the original cubic crystal and specific to the artificial triangular lattice: transport measurements show the Hall coefficient changing sign as the chemical potential sweeps through the artificial bands. Uniquely, the artificial bandstructure can be continuously tuned to form linear graphene-like and flat kagome-like bands in a single device. A strong insulating state is observed at half filling of the kagome flat band, which is not expected in the absence of strong interactions. This state, unique to the kagome lattice, is consistent with a loop-current Wigner insulator, which arises from long-range Coulomb interaction and delocalised electrons between neighbouring empty sites. The ability to continuously tune the bandstructure and access flat bands through electrical gating within a single device opens a new route to studying collective quantum states.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Suppl.: 16 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01738v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hopf terms are topological theta terms that are associated with a host of interesting physics, including anyons, statistical transmutation, chiral edge states, and the quantum spin-Hall effect. Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $θ$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $π$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital Altermagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00509v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of \emph{orbital altermagnetism}, a symmetry-protected magnetic order of pure orbital degrees of freedom. It is characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking. First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$, so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand, it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO. The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.</p></details> | 16 Page, 9 Figures |
| **[Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagomé metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting state in a kagomé lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |

Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagomé lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagomé lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagomé metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagomé lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09316v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |

However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $κ_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120°, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Fate of chiral order and impurity self-pinning in flat bands with local symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01780v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interacting bosons on a single plaquette threaded by a $π$-flux can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a chiral loop current. Connecting such bosonic $π$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $π$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04601v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</p></details> |  |

| **[Random-Matrix-Induced Simplicity Bias in Over-parameterized Variational Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01877v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-parameterization is commonly used to increase the expressivity of variational quantum circuits (VQCs), yet deeper and more highly parameterized circuits often exhibit poor trainability and limited generalization. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Quantum Circuits for Matrix-Product Unitaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08160v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this Letter, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^α)$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $α$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^β \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $β\le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.</p></details> | Published version |
| **[Clifford Circuits Augmented Grassmann Matrix Product States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04164v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor-network (TN) methods have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can suppress substantial portions of the entanglement structure, effectively alleviating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, once the natural Grassmann-evenness requirement of the fermionic formulation is taken into account and Clifford gates with identical entanglement action are grouped together, the original set of 11520 two-qubit Clifford gates reduces to only 12 distinct gates. This strong reduction leads to a more efficient disentangling scheme within the fermionic framework. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures; v2: references and end matter added</p></details> |
| **[Biased-Noise Thresholds of Zero-Rate Holographic Codes with Tensor-Network Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06232v3)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial insight for practical quantum error correction is that different types of errors, such as single-qubit Pauli operators, typically occur with different probabilities. Finding an optimal quantum code under such biased noise is a challenging problem, related to the (generally unknown) maximum capacity of the corresponding noisy channel. A benchmark for this capacity is given by the hashing bound, which describes the performance of random stabilizer codes and leads to the matter of identifying codes that come close to the bound while also being efficiently decodable. In this work, we perform the first comprehensive analysis of asymptotically zero-rate holographic codes under biased noise. We show that many representatives from such models of this code class fulfill both the channel optimality and efficient decoding guarantees for tensor-network codes. In fact, all holographic codes tested were found to reach the hashing bound in some bias regime, while several built from the $\codepar{5,1,2}$ surface code and $\codepar{6,1,3}$ code exceed state-of-the-art code performance in the 2-Pauli noise regime. Furthermore, we consider Clifford deformations which allow all considered codes to reach the hashing bound for 1-Pauli noise as well. Our results establish that holographic codes, which were previously shown to possess efficient tensor-network decoders, also exhibit competitive thresholds under biased noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEGO_HQEC: Automating the Analysis, Construction, and Decoding of Holographic Quantum Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22861v3)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is a crucial prerequisite for future large-scale quantum computation. Finding and analyzing new QEC codes, along with efficient decoding and fault-tolerance protocols, is central to this effort. Holographic codes are a recent class of generalized concatenated codes derived from holographic bulk/boundary dualities. In addition to exploring the physics of such dualities, these codes possess useful QEC properties such as tunable encoding rates, distance scaling competitive with other well-studied code classes,and excellent recovery thresholds. To allow for a comprehensive analysis of holographic code constructions, we introduce LEGO_HQEC, a software package utilizing the quantum LEGO formalism. This package allows for the construction and analysis of holographic codes on regular hyperbolic tilings, computing their stabilizer generators and logical operators for a specified number of seed codes and layers. Three decoders are included: an erasure decoder based on Gaussian elimination; an integeroptimization decoder; and a tensor-network decoder. With these tools, LEGO_HQEC enables systematic studies of both previously known holographic codes and novel variants. As a demonstration, we provide new numerical results on the holographic blackhole pentagon code, establishing its threshold behavior under the erasure channel as a benchmark example.</p></details> |  |

| **[Tensor-Network Analysis of Root Patterns in the XXX Model with Open Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24182v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The string hypothesis for Bethe roots represents a cornerstone in the study of quantum integrable systems, providing access to physical quantities such as the ground-state energy and the finite-temperature free energy. While the $t-W$ scheme and the inhomogeneous $T-Q$ relation have enabled significant methodological advances for systems with broken $U(1)$ symmetry, the underlying physics induced by symmetry breaking remains largely unexplored, due to the previously unknown distributions of the transfer-matrix roots. In this paper, we propose a new approach to determining the patterns of zero roots and Bethe roots for the $Λ-θ$ and inhomogeneous Bethe ansatz equations using tensor-network algorithms. As an explicit example, we consider the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with non-diagonal boundary conditions. The exact structures of both zero roots and Bethe roots are obtained in the ground state for large system sizes, up to ($N\simeq 60$ and $100$). We find that even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, the Bethe and zero roots still exhibit a highly structured pattern. The zero roots organize into bulk strings, boundary strings, and additional roots, forming two dominant lines with boundary-string attachments. Correspondingly, the Bethe roots can be classified into four distinct types: regular roots, line roots, arc roots, and paired-line roots. These structures are associated with a real-axis line, a vertical line, characteristic arcs in the complex plane, and boundary-induced conjugate pairs. Comparative analysis reveals that the $t-W$ scheme generates significantly simpler root topologies than those obtained via off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz.</p></details> | 64 pages, 34 figures |

However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |

By performing time-evolution along a complex-time contour, the approach balances computational cost with the difficulty of spectral recovery, offering greater flexibility than methods confined to the real or imaginary axis. By complementing the complex-time evolution with an exponential fitting scheme, we faithfully extract real-time information at negligible cost. The resulting method obtains high-resolution spectra at a significantly lower computational cost than real-time evolution, offering a promising tool for ab initio studies of strongly correlated materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22720v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 + 7...</summary><p>8 + 7 pages; 6 + 6 figures</p></details> |

Quantum inspired generative models, such as Born machines based on the matrix product state framework, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in unsupervised learning tasks. This study advances the Born machine paradigm by introducing trainable token embeddings through positive operator valued measurements, replacing the traditional approach of static tensor indices. Key technical innovations include encoding tokens as quantum measurement operators with trainable parameters and leveraging QR decomposition to adjust the physical dimensions of the MPS. This approach maximizes the utilization of operator space and enhances the model's expressiveness. Empirical results on RNA data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces negative log likelihood compared to one hot embeddings, with higher physical dimensions further enhancing single site probabilities and multi site correlations. The model also outperforms GPT2 in single site estimation and achieves competitive correlation modeling, showcasing the potential of trainable POVM embeddings for complex data correlations in quantum inspired sequence modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph restricted tensors: building blocks for holographic networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23005v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze few-body quantum states with particular correlation properties imposed by the requirement of maximal bipartite entanglement for selected partitions of the system into two complementary parts. A novel framework to treat this problem by encoding these constraints in a graph is advocated; the resulting objects are called ``graph-restricted tensors''. This framework encompasses several examples previously treated in the literature, such as 1-uniform multipartite states, quantum states related to dual unitary operators and absolutely maximally entangled states (AME) corresponding to 2-unitary matrices. Original examples of presented graph-restricted tensors are motivated by tensor network models for the holographic principle. In concrete cases we find exact analytic solutions, demonstrating thereby that there exists a vast landscape of non-stabilizer tensors useful for the lattice models of holography.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07242v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_τ$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_τ$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_τ}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_τ)$ generated by $\mathcal H_τ$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_τ^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_τ)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_τ$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</p></details> | 53 pages, 11 figures |

This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds.

| **[Holographic Tensor Networks as Tessellations of Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19452v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Holographic tensor networks serve as toy models for the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, capturing many of its essential features in a concrete manner. However, existing holographic tensor network models remain far from a complete theory of quantum gravity. A key obstacle is their discrete structure, which only approximates the semi-classical geometry of gravity in a qualitative sense. In \cite{Lin:2024dho}, it was shown that a network of partial-entanglement-entropy (PEE) threads, which are bulk geodesics with a specific density distribution, generates a perfect tessellation of AdS space. Moreover, such PEE-network tessellations can be constructed for more general geometries using the Crofton formula. In this paper, we assign a quantum state to each vertex in the PEE network and develop two holographic tensor network models: the factorized PEE tensor network, which takes the form of a tensor product of EPR pairs, and the random PEE tensor network. In both models we reproduce the exact Ryu-Takayanagi formula by showing that the minimal number of cuts along a homologous surface in the network exactly computes the area of this surface.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 15 figures.

Focusing on the fully antiferromagnetic $J$-$J_d$ model with $J_h = J_t := J$, we map out the ground-state phase diagram as a function of the dimer coupling $J_d$. Our results show that the system hosts only two phases: a magnetically ordered canted-$120^\circ$ phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase. We identify a first-order transition between these two phases at $J_d/J \approx 1.45$. Within the magnetically ordered phase, we observe small but finite magnetic moments. We also resolve the quantum renormalization of the canting angle, which deviates from the classical prediction over almost the entire magnetically ordered phase.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moiré systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moiré systems, including super-moiré with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moiré patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moiré, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moiré systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moiré systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review Research.

| **[Learning transitions of topological surface codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19786v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...</p></details> | 25 pages, 13 figures |

| **[Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto ω^s$ via dissipation strengths $α_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $α_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $α_z = α_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s<1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 23 figures; published version</p></details> |
| **[Precise computation of universal corner entanglement entropy at 2+1 dimension: From Ising to Gaussian quantum critical points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00382v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its central role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Building on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable~\cite{zhouIncremental2024,zhangIntegral2024,liaoExtracting2024}, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner of EE at QCPs in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction. Turning on this interaction allows us to trace an Ising critical line, reaching the tricritical point, and then a line of first-order phase transition. In (2+1)d, the tricritical point is described by the Gaussian theory, where a theoretical calculation of the corner logarithmic term in the 2nd Rényi entropy term is available~\cite{UniversalCasini2007}. Our QMC results are in quantitative agreement with this theoretical value, providing a highly nontrivial benchmark of the algorithm. Furthermore, we also study the Rényi EE at the Ising critical line and on the first-order transition line, obtaining results consistent with theoretical expectations. These findings establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+9 ...</summary><p>12+9 pages, 8+9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Coordination-driven magic numbers in protonated argon clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00591v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structural properties of rare-gas clusters can be primarily described by a simple sphere packing model or by pairwise interactions. Remarkably, adding a single proton yields a large set of magic numbers that has remained unexplained. In this Letter, we unravel their origin by combining quantum Monte Carlo techniques with many-body ab initio potentials that correctly capture the proton's coordination environment. Thanks to this approach, we find that argon atoms are mainly localized around the classical minimum, resulting in a particularly rigid behavior in stark contrast to lighter rare-gas clusters. Moreover, as cluster size increases, we identify a clear structural transition from many-body coordination-driven stability to a regime dominated by two-body interactions, reflecting a reshaping of the underlying potential energy landscape.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Assembling a Bose-Hubbard superfluid from tweezer-controlled single atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24374v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations or high-temperature expansion series complemented with the entropy method. We also discuss a recent proposal about hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Condensed Matter Physics (https://cmpj2.icmp.lviv.ua/index.php/cmpj/index)</p></details> |
| **[Universal Entanglement Growth along Imaginary Time in Quantum Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23361v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting the Broken Symmetry Phase of Solid Hydrogen: A Neural Network Variational Monte Carlo Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17703v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The crystal structure of high-pressure solid hydrogen remains a fundamental open problem. Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-hole spectral functions in 1D quantum magnets with different ground states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20447v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thanks to improved methods for numerical analytic continuation with constraints, spectral functions with sharp features can now be extracted from imaginary-time correlation functions computed by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,ω)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,τ)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,ω)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=π$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.</p></details> | 19 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Comparative study of plasmons in half-filled graphene via Quantum Monte Carlo and Random Phase Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20559v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quantum vs thermal fluctuations in phase transitions of two-dimensional superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20476v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Theory of Scalable Spin Squeezing with Disordered Quantum Dipoles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19781v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures + 20 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Quantum decay of magnons in the unfrustrated honeycomb Heisenberg model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19162v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the physical properties of elementary magnon excitations of the ordered antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, series expansions (SE), and continuous similarity transformations (CST). The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the "roton minimum" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Loop Algorithm for Quantum Transverse Ising Model in a Longitudinal Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17835v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum transverse Ising model and its extensions play a critical role in various fields, such as statistical physics, quantum magnetism, quantum simulations, and mathematical physics. Although it does not suffer from the sign problem in most cases, the corresponding quantum Monte Carlo algorithm performs inefficiently, especially at a large longitudinal field. The main hindrance is the lack of loop update method which can strongly decrease the auto-correlation between Monte Carlo steps. Here, we successfully develop a loop algorithm with a novel merge-unmerge process. It demonstrates a great advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithm when implementing it to simulate the Rydberg atom chain and Kagome qubit ice. This advanced algorithm suits various systems such as Rydberg atom arrays, trapped ions, quantum materials, and quantum annealers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, comments are welcome, and more information at http://cqutp.org/users/xfzhang/</p></details> |
| **[Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06284v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo studies of U(1) lattice gauge models of Kondo breakdown](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17801v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the local-moment regime, heavy fermions are most economically described by a compact U(1) gauge theory. With this formulation of the Kondo lattice, we study a spin chain coupled to two-dimensional Dirac conduction electrons. The spin chain is described by fermionic partons carrying spin and U(1) gauge charge. The heavy-fermion quasiparticle is a bound state of a U(1) matter field carrying unit electric and U(1) gauge charge, and the fermionic parton. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify two symmetry-equivalent regimes: a heavy-fermion metal with a sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust low-frequency transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with an incoherent resonance and vanishing low-frequency transport. For any finite lattice extent in the direction perpendicular to the chain, the Luttinger volume of the heavy-fermion phase counts both composite and conduction electrons, while in the Kondo-breakdown phase it counts only the conduction electrons. The evolution of the composite-fermion spectrum, dynamical spin structure factor, and optical conductivity provides a nonperturbative demonstration of gauge-mediated Kondo breakdown and establishes transport fingerprints of an orbital-selective Mott transition in the context of U(1) gauge theories of heavy fermions.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures plus supplemental material (16 pages, 10 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Accurate atomic correlation and total energies for correlation consistent effective core potentials II: Rb-Xe elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17063v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We employ correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) to perform exact or nearly exact correlation and total energy calculations for the fifth-row elements (Rb-Xe). Total energies are calculated using various correlated methods: configuration interaction (CI), coupled-cluster (CC) up to perturbative quadruple excitations whenever feasible, and stochastic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches. In order to estimate the energy at the complete basis set (CBS) limit, the basis sets are constructed systematically through aug-cc-p(C)VnZ for each ccECP and further extrapolated to the CBS limit within the corresponding methods. Kinetic energies are evaluated at the FCI/CISD level to provide insights into the electron density and localization of the ccECPs. We also provide data sets for widely used diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to quantify fixed-node biases with single-reference trial wavefunctions. These comprehensive benchmarks validate the accuracy of ccECPs within the CC, CI, and QMC methodologies, thus providing accurate and tested valence-only Hamiltonians for many-body electronic structure calculations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Interfacial Strain Modulated Correlated Plasmons in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 and Their Role in High-temperature Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16417v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials remains a major challenge in physics due to the complexity of their strongly correlated electronic states. Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings. The collective evidence from both the experimental results and theoretical findings provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrupolar and dipolar phases of excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide trilayer heterostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15848v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments on trilayer transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have revealed the rich behavior of dipolar excitons. Motivated by these experimental observations, we investigate the collective dynamics of planar quantum dipoles whose orientation fluctuates due to charge tunneling between the outer layers. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons.</p></details> | 24 pages, 20 figures |
| **[The Bose-Hubbard polaron from weak to strong coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00486v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.</p></details> |  |

We make use of the Modified Periodic Coulomb potential formalism to account for the long-range character of the interaction, and explore a range of density corresponding to average interparticle separation $1 \le r_s\le 80$. We report numerical results based on simulations of system comprising up to 2304 particles. We find a superfluid ground state for $r_s$ as large as 70, i.e., significantly above the most recent numerical estimate of the Wigner crystallization threshold, which we estimate at $r_W \approx 71$. Furthermore, no thermally re-entrant crystalline phase nor any evidence of metastable bubbles is observed near the transition, in contrast with a previous theoretical study in which quantum statistics was neglected. The computed superfluid transition temperature depends remarkably weakly on density.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fourt...</summary><p>Fourteen pages, six figures in color</p></details> |

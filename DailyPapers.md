| **[Finite-momentum superconductivity from chiral bands in twisted MoTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18886v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent experiment has reported unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, emerging from a normal state that exhibits a finite anomalous Hall effect -- a signature of intrinsic chirality. Motivated by this discovery, we construct a continuum model for twisted MoTe$_2$ constrained by lattice symmetries from first-principles calculations that captures the moir\'{e}-induced inversion symmetry breaking even in the absence of a displacement field. Building on this model, we show that repulsive interactions give rise to finite-momentum superconductivity via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism in this chiral moir\'{e} system. Remarkably, the finite-momentum superconducting state can arise solely from internal symmetry breaking of the moir\'{e} superlattice, differentiating it from previously studied cases that require external fields. It further features a nonreciprocal quasiparticle dispersion and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect. Our results highlight a novel route to unconventional superconducting states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides moir\'{e} systems, driven entirely by intrinsic symmetry-breaking effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electromagnetic Proximity Effect: Superconducting Magnonics and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18502v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exchange interaction at interfaces between superconductors (SCs) and ferromagnets (FMs) has been a central topic in condensed matter physics for many decades, starting with the prediction of exotic phases such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states and leading to the discovery of triplet superconductivity. This review focuses on new phenomena in SC$|$FM heterostructures caused by the \textit{non-contact dipolar interaction} between magnons, i.e., the quanta of spin wave excitations in the ferromagnet, and the superconducting order. A universal non-relativistic spin-orbit coupling locks the polarization and momentum of their evanescent stray magnetic fields and leads to chiral screening by proximate superconductors. The interaction-induced hybrid quasiparticles are magnon-Meissner collective modes, magnon-cooparon, Josephson plasmonic modes, and nodal magnon-photon polaritons. Superconducting and normal metallic gates modulate and control the magnetodipolar interaction and thereby magnetization and energy transport at interfaces and in thin films.</p></details> | <details><summary>108 p...</summary><p>108 pages, 45 figures</p></details> |
| **[Non-unital noise in a superconducting quantum computer as a computational resource for reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07886v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We identify a noise model that ensures the functioning of an echo state network employing a gate-based quantum computer for reservoir computing applications. Energy dissipation induced by amplitude damping drastically improves the short-term memory capacity and expressivity of the network, by simultaneously providing fading memory and richer dynamics. There is an ideal dissipation rate that ensures the best operation of the echo state network around $\gamma\sim$ 0.03. Nevertheless, these beneficial effects are stable as the intensity of the applied noise increases. The improvement of the learning is confirmed by emulating a realistic noise model applied to superconducting qubits, paving the way for the application of reservoir computing methods in current non-fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing d-wave superconducting gap of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_{10+Î´}$ by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18363v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting gap is a characteristic feature of high-T$_c$ superconductors and provides crucial information on the pairing mechanism underlying high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Cu $L_3$-edge to investigate the superconducting gap in the overdoped cuprate $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_{10+\delta}$ ($T_\mathrm{c}$ = 107 K). By analyzing antisymmetrized, temperature-dependent RIXS spectra over a range of in-plane momentum transfers, we observe a clear suppression of low-energy spectral weight below T$_c$, indicative of superconducting gap formation. This suppression is most pronounced at small momentum transfers ($|\boldsymbol{q}_\parallel| \leq 0.18$ r.l.u.) and corresponds to a gap size of approximately 2$\Delta_0 \sim$ 130 meV. Comparison with theoretical calculations of the momentum-dependent charge susceptibility supports a d-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap, while an isotropic s-wave gap fails to reproduce key experimental features. These findings establish RIXS as a powerful, bulk-sensitive probe of superconducting gap symmetry and highlight its utility for studying materials beyond the reach of surface-sensitive techniques such as ARPES and STM.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Correlated Error Bursts in a Gap-Engineered Superconducting Qubit Array](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18228v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the roadblocks towards the implementation of a fault-tolerant superconducting quantum processor is impacts of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. Such impacts temporarily elevate the density of quasiparticles (QPs) across the device, leading to correlated qubit error bursts. The most damaging errors, $T_1$ errors, stem from QP tunneling across the qubit Josephson junctions (JJs). Recently, we demonstrated that this type of error can be strongly suppressed by engineering the profile of superconducting gap at the JJs in a way that prevents QP tunneling. In this work, we identify a new type of impact-induced correlated error that persists in the presence of gap engineering. We observe that impacts shift the frequencies of the affected qubits, and thus lead to correlated phase errors. The frequency shifts are systematically negative, reach values up to $3\,{\rm MHz}$, and last for $\sim 1\,{\rm ms}$. We provide evidence that the shifts originate from QP-qubit interactions in the JJ region. Further, we demonstrate that the shift-induced phase errors can be detrimental to the performance of quantum error correction protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thermal phase slips in superconducting films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18130v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dissipationless supercurrent state in superconductors can be destroyed by thermal fluctuations. Thermally activated phase slips provide a finite resistance of the sample and are responsible for dark counts in superconducting single photon detectors. The activation barrier for a phase slip is determined by a space-dependent saddle-point (instanton) configuration of the order parameter. In the one-dimensional wire geometry, such a saddle point has been analytically obtained by Langer and Ambegaokar in the vicinity of the critical temperature, $T_c$, and for arbitrary bias currents below the critical current $I_c$. In the two-dimensional geometry of a superconducting strip, which is relevant for photon detection, the situation is much more complicated. Depending on the ratio $I/I_c$, several types of saddle-point configurations have been proposed, with their energies being obtained numerically. We demonstrate that the saddle-point configuration for an infinite superconducting film at $I\to I_c$ is described by the exactly integrable Boussinesq equation solved by Hirota's method. The instanton size is $L_x\sim\xi(1-I/I_c)^{-1/4}$ along the current and $L_y\sim\xi(1-I/I_c)^{-1/2}$ perpendicular to the current, where $\xi$ is the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length. The activation energy for thermal phase slips scales as $\Delta F^\text{2D}\propto (1-I/I_c)^{3/4}$. For sufficiently wide strips of width $w\gg L_y$, a half-instanton is formed near the boundary, with the activation energy being 1/2 of $\Delta F^\text{2D}$.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Influence of nanostructuring through high-pressure torsion (HPT) on superconductivity of a high-entropy alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17850v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as favorable choices for different applications, including superconductors. The present work examines the impact of nanostructuring via high-pressure torsion (HPT) on the superconducting properties of the equiatomic TiZrHfNbTa HEA. Structural characterization reveals a progressive refinement of grain size and increased dislocation density, together with partial phase transformation to an {\omega} phase with HPT processing. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements indicate a systematic enhancement in the superconducting transition temperature (from $T_c =$ 6.2 K to 7.2 K) and critical magnetic field, as well as the stabilization of the superconductivity state by HPT processing. The improvement of superconducting properties is attributed to microstructural modifications such as grain boundary density, defect generation and phase transformations, and their impact on vortex pinning, quantum confinement and electron scattering. The results suggest that nanostructuring through severe plastic deformation provides an appropriate route to optimize superconducting properties in high-entropy superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasiparticle Dynamics in NbN Superconducting Microwave Resonators at Single Photon Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17816v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exchanging energy below the superconducting gap introduces quasiparticle energy distributions in superconducting quantum circuits, which will be responsible for their decoherence. This study examines the impact of quasiparticle energy on the performance of NbN superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon chips. We measured the resonance frequency and internal quality factor in response to temperature sweeps to evaluate the effect of quasiparticle dynamics. Moreover, by calculating the complex conductivity of the NbN film, we identified the contribution of quasiparticle density to the experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Proximity Effect in Two-Dimensional Hole Gases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04084v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technology involving hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission. Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices. While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research. Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases. In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands. We start from the Luttinger-Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor-semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands. Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties. Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of $s$-wave and $d$-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our results thus present a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Multiple-Nanowire Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices: Critical Currents, Symmetries, and Vorticity Stability Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23095v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.</p></details> | 24 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Field-Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17651v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00088v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, plus Appendices</p></details> |
| **[Improving the lifetime of aluminum-based superconducting qubits through atomic layer etching and deposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17474v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a dry surface treatment combining atomic layer etching and deposition (ALE and ALD) to mitigate dielectric loss in fully fabricated superconducting quantum devices formed from aluminum thin films on silicon. The treatment, performed as a final processing step prior to device packaging, starts by conformally removing the native metal oxide and fabrication residues from the exposed surfaces through ALE before \textit{in situ} encapsulating the metal surfaces with a thin dielectric layer using ALD. We measure a two-fold reduction in loss attributed to two-level system (TLS) absorption in treated aluminum-based resonators and planar transmon qubits. Treated transmons with compact capacitor plates and gaps achieve median $Q$ and $T_1$ values of $3.69 \pm 0.42 \times 10^6$ and $196 \pm 22$~$\mu$s, respectively. These improvements were found to be sustained over several months. We discuss how the combination of ALE and ALD reverses fabrication-induced surface damages to significantly and durably improve device performance via a reduction of the TLS defect density in the capacitive elements.</p></details> | 20 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Robustness of Majorana modes to potential disorder in Fe chains on a superconducting Rashba alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17414v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Majorana modes offer great potential for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their topological protection. However, for superconductor-semiconductor nanowire hybrids, intrinsic disorder makes the unambiguous detection of Majorana modes difficult. Here, we construct 1D spin chains from individual Fe atoms on the Rashba surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111) with proximity-induced superconductivity from a Nb(110) substrate. While the Fe chains exhibit perfect crystalline order, we observe nano-scale potential disorder of the BiAg2/Ag(111)/Nb(110) heterostructure by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, this does not prevent the emergence of zero-energy modes at both ends of the Fe chains, in agreement with tight-binding calculations showing that they are only found in the topologically non-trivial regime of the phase diagram. These Majorana modes are indeed robust against potential disorder.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Unraveling the Robust Superconductivity Phenomenon of High-Entropy Alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17147v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments demonstrate a "robust superconductivity phenomenon" in niobium-based alloys, where the superconducting state remains intact and the critical temperature ($T_c$) is largely unaffected by external pressure well above tens of gigapascal (GPa) into the megabar regime ($\ge 100 GPa$). Motivated by these observations, we perform first-principles electron-phonon calculations for body-centered cubic Nb and NbTi crystals, as well as for special quasi-random structures of Nb$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$ and (NbTa)$_{0.7}$(HfZrTi)$_{0.3}$ high-entropy alloy (HEA). The calculations unravel the underlying mechanism of robust superconductivity, stemming from a compensation effect between varying electronic and phonon properties under pressure. The results also reveal how structural and chemical disorders modify the superconducting state. The first-principles $T_c$ values agree quantitatively with the experiments throughout the entire pressure range under study. Our work thereby paves the way for exploring superconducting HEAs under pressure via advanced first-principles simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main document: 18 pages, 3 figures; SI document: 6 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Electric field control of superconducting fluctuations and quasiparticle interference at oxide interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17056v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate tunable superconducting transitions in (111)$\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{KTaO}_3$ field-effect devices. Large increases in conductivity, associated with superconducting fluctuations, are observed far above the transition temperature. However, the standard Aslamazov-Larkin paraconductivity model significantly underestimates the effect observed here. We use a model that includes conductivity corrections from normal state quasiparticle interference together with all contributions from superconducting fluctuations evaluated at arbitrary temperatures and in the short-wavelength limit. Through analysis of the magnetoconductance and resistive transitions, we find that the large conductivity increase can be explained by a combination of weak anti-localization and Maki-Thompson superconducting fluctuations. Both contributions are enabled by a strong temperature dependence of the electron's decoherence time compatible with an electron-phonon scattering scenario. We find that conductivity corrections are modulated by the electrostatic field effect, that governs a competition between normal-state quasiparticle interference and superconducting fluctuations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resonantly enhanced superconductivity mediated by spinor condensates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07419v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving strong interactions in fermionic many-body systems is a major theme of research in condensed matter physics. It is well-known that interactions between fermions can be mediated through a bosonic medium, such as a phonon bath or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we show that such induced attraction can be resonantly enhanced when the bosonic medium is a two-component spinor BEC. The strongest interaction is achieved by tuning the boson-boson scattering to the quantum critical spinodal point of the BEC where the sound velocity vanishes. The fermion pairing gap and the superconducting critical temperature can thus be dramatically enhanced. We propose two experimental realizations of this scenario, with exciton-polariton systems in two-dimensional semiconductors and ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Here we examine a topological Josephson junction with mixed $s$+$p$-wave pairing, where topological phase transition can be driven by adjusting the ratio between the pairing components. There exist two exact symmetrically positioned zero-energy level crossings for the Andreev-bound states, which can be shifted by external fields, and can be destroyed or recreated in pairs by a time-reversal breaking Zeeman field or inhomogeneities, exhibiting band-like structure. The dependence of the shift on the Zeeman field is linear when the two $p$-wave $\boldsymbol{d}$-vectors on both sides are identical while quadratic when they are distinct. Near the topological phase transition, the topological $p$-wave dominant junctions host MF-induced pronounced superconducting diode effect with high efficiency factor $Q$ up to 30 %, in contrast to the trivial $s$-wave dominant junctions possessing relatively small $Q$.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Josephson wormhole in coupled superconducting Yukawa-SYK metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16907v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19501v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We conduct first-principles simulations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$7$, a nickelate in which a recent series of experiments found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the hydrostatic pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in effective on-site repulsion in the maximally localized Wannier functions comprising the Ni 3$d$ $e_g$ bands crossing the Fermi energy, as determined by density functional theory. We attribute this increase to reduced screening by the spacer La 5$d{x^2 - y^2}$ bands -- an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electron correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we leverage intrinsic chemical pressure by applying the methodology to Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

Using this concept, we prove that local electron correlations in the Hubbard model are fully classical: in the natural basis the local reduced density matrix is separable and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. Our results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and the nonlocal correlations with its quantum environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + references | 3 figures | Comments welcome!</p></details> |
| **[Pairing phase diagram for electron-doped cuprates in the square-lattice $t-U-V$ Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07079v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Dynamic Competition Between Hubbard and Superexchange Interactions Selectively Localizes Electrons and Holes Through Polarons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00770v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling the effects of photoexcited polarons in transition metal oxides can enable the long timescale charge separation necessary for renewable energy applications as well as controlling new quantum phases through dynamically tunable electron-phonon coupling. In previously studied transition metal oxides, polaron formation is facilitated by a photoexcited ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). When the polaron is formed, oxygen atoms move away from iron centers, which increases carrier localization at the metal center and decreases charge hopping. Studies of yttrium iron garnet and erbium iron oxide have suggested that strong electron and spin correlations can modulate photoexcited polaron formation. To understand the interplay between strong spin and electronic correlations in highly polar materials, we studied gadolinium iron oxide (GdFeO3), which selectively forms photoexcited polarons through an Fe-O-Fe superexchange inter-action. Excitation-wavelength-dependent transient extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy selectively excites LMCT and metal-to-metal charge transfer transitions (MMCT). The LMCT transition suppresses photoexcited polaron formation due to the balance between superexchange and Hubbard interactions, while MMCT transitions result in photoexcited polaron formation within 250+/-40 fs. Ab initio theory demonstrates that electron and hole polarons localize on iron centers following MMCT. In addition to understanding how strong electronic and spin correlations can control strong electron-phonon coupling, these experiments separately measure electron and hole polaron interactions on neighboring metal centers for the first time, providing insight into a large range of charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard insulators.</p></details> | 29 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Suppression of the Mott insulating phase in the particle-hole asymmetric Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06674v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the phase diagram of the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT), focusing on the effects of particle-hole asymmetry (PHA) in the single-band Hubbard model. Our dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) study reveals that the introduction of PHA in the model significantly influences the critical temperature ($T_c$) and interaction strength ($U_c$), as well as the size of the co-existence region of metallic and insulating phases at low temperatures. Specifically, as the system is moved away from particle-hole symmetry, $T_c$ decreases and $U_c$ increases, indicating a suppression of the insulating phase and the strengthening of the metallic behavior. Additionally, the first-order transition line between metallic and insulating phases is better defined in the model with PHA, leading to a reduced co-existence region at $T<T_c$. Moreover, we propose that the MIT can be characterized by the charge density, which serves as a viable alternative to zero-frequency spectral density typically used in DMFT calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the role of particle-hole asymmetry in the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the MIT even in a very simple system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version. 11 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Update of Hartree--Fock theory for Hubbard-like models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16525v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the standard textbook description of (restricted) Hartree--Fock theory for (Fermi) Hubbard-like models is in need of an update, and we present such an update allowing us to correct basic and established results in the condensed matter physics literature that are qualitatively wrong. Our update amounts to adding a test which reliably checks the thermodynamic stability of solutions of Hartree--Fock equations. This stability test makes it possible to detect, by simple means and with certainty, regions in phase space where the model exhibits mixed phases where two conventional phases coexist and translation invariance is broken in complicated ways; in such a mixed phase, unconventional physics is to be expected. Our results show that mixed phases are ubiquitous in Hubbard-like models in arbitrary dimensions.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Rev. Lett. 132, 263402 (2024)] and shown to describe altermagnetism that can be studied in cold atom systems. Using an updated Hartree--Fock method that can detect instabilities towards phase separation, we show that the model is in a mixed phase in large parts of the parameter regime at half-filling. We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures.

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

In this work we study the Mott insulating phases of the SU(3) Hubbard model at 1/3-filling using infinite projected entangled-pair states, optimized with both imaginary time evolution and variational optimization. In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |

Since lattice dynamical properties are closely linked to electronic structures, the Hubbard-corrected density functional perturbation theory (DFPT+$U$) can calculate them at the same level of accuracy. To investigate the effects of $U$ on electron-phonon (el-ph) interactions, we implemented DFPT+$U$ with a Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism to determine $U$ self-consistently and applied our method to compute optical and transport properties of transparent conductive oxides of CdO and ZnO. For CdO, we find that opening a band gap due to $U$ restores the long-range Fr\"ohlich interaction and that its calculated mobility and absorption spectrum are in excellent agreement with experiments. For ZnO where a band gap already appears at the DFT level, DFPT+$U$ brings the results into much closer alignment with experiment, thus demonstrating improved accuracy of our method in dealing with el-ph interactions in these technologically important materials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

In this article, we propose a theoretical scheme to construct a time-dependent rank-2 tensor electric field by introducing a periodically driving quadratic potential in a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, and investigate the dynamics of dipole and fracton excitations when the drive frequency is resonant with the on-site interaction. We find that the dynamics are dominated by the splitting of large dipoles with the photon-assisted correlated tunneling and the movement of small dipoles, both of which can be well controlled by the drive amplitude. Our work provides a possible approach for engineering the dynamics of dipole-conserving quantum systems via tensor gauge fields.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.</p></details> | 10 pages, 21 figures |

Remarkably, it was also recently realized that shielded polar molecules exhibit an SU(N) symmetry among their hyperfine states, opening the door to SU(N) systems with larger N, bosonic particle statistics, and tunable interactions -- both repulsive and attractive. Motivated by these results, we have studied the SU(3) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on a square lattice. Using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method, we explore the finite-temperature phase diagram and provide evidence for three distinct regions -- a three-component Fermi liquid (FL) region, a "trion" liquid (TL) region, and an ordered Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW phase is stable at finite temperature (in contrast to the SU(2) CDW), while the FL to TL crossover appears to point to a quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Our method extends straightforwardly to larger N and is sign-problem free for even values of N. With these results, we demonstrate the potential physics enabled by using polar molecules as a quantum simulation platform for the attractive SU(N) FHM.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 pages of supplemental material (with 3 supplemental figures)</p></details> |

Inspired by the large lattice constants of moir\'e materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+17...</summary><p>14+17 pages, 3+3 figures. v2: improvements and references added in response to referee comments; refined appendix on edge states</p></details> |

Recently, progress in quantum simulators has enabled the measurement of site resolved snapshots of Fermi-Hubbard systems at finite doping on square as well as triangular lattice geometries. These experimental advances pose the quest for theorists to analyze the ensuing data in order to gain insights into these prototypical, strongly correlated many-body systems. Here we employ machine learning techniques to optimize the mean-field parameters of a resonating valence bond (RVB) state through comparison with experimental data, thus determining a possible underlying simple model that is physically motivated and fully interpretable. We find that the resulting RVB states are capable of capturing two- as well as three-point correlations measured in experiments, even when they are not specifically used in the optimization. The analysis of the mean-field parameters and their doping dependence can be used to obtain physical insights and shed light on the nature of possible underlying quantum spin liquid states. Our results show that finite temperature data from Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators can be well captured by RVB states. This work paves the way for a new, systematic analysis of data from numerical as well as quantum simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary lattice.</p></details> |  |

The phenomenon was recently observed with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. Here, we explore the kinetic ferromagnetism within the square lattice Hubbard model and its strong-coupling counterpart, the $t-J$ model, at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit via numerical linked-cluster expansions. We find evidence of ferromagnetic Nagaoka polarons at dopings up to $\sim 30\%$ away from half filling for a variety of interaction strengths and at temperatures as low as $0.2$ of the hopping energy. We map out the boundaries of this phase through analyzing various correlation functions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |

However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

| **[Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19501v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We conduct first-principles simulations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$7$, a nickelate in which a recent series of experiments found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the hydrostatic pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in effective on-site repulsion in the maximally localized Wannier functions comprising the Ni 3$d$ $e_g$ bands crossing the Fermi energy, as determined by density functional theory. We attribute this increase to reduced screening by the spacer La 5$d{x^2 - y^2}$ bands -- an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electron correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we leverage intrinsic chemical pressure by applying the methodology to Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Microscopic evidence of charge- and spin-density waves in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-Î´}$ revealed by $^{139}$La-NQR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11248v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with a transition temperature $T_c$ close to 80 K at high pressures has attracted significant attention, due particularly to a possible density wave (DW) transition occurring near the superconducting dome. Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to a unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetically ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest a simultaneous formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ , thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Unconventional Superconducting Pairing Symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: from the Perspective of Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) (HTSC) in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with critical temperature $T_c$ higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has aroused a surge in the exploration of HTSC in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase multilayer nickelates. Very recently, SC is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ substrate with $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40\text{ K}$) at ambient pressure (AP), allowing various experimental investigation on the pairing mechanism in this material. It is now eager to enhance the $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Here we propose that an imposed strong perpendicular electric field can strongly enhance the $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. The physics underlying this proposal is clear and simple. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this layer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly enhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study and comprehensive two-orbital one under the mean-field treatment and the density matrix renormalization group approach consistently verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers is enough to realize HTSC with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15906v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors. This work lays the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical investigations into the unique electronic properties of these emerging materials.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures and appendix</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K under I4/mmm space group. The susceptibility measurements confirm bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10.

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital.

Our first-principles and symmetry-based analysis reveal that interlayer stacking symmetry plays a central role in determining the nature of electron-hole pairs. We uncover a rich variety of excitonic states, including spatially confined two-dimensional (2D) excitons, delocalized three-dimensional (3D) excitons, and charge-transfer (CT) excitons with interlayer character. The dimensionality and optical activity of these excitons are governed by the interplay among orbital character, interlayer hybridization, and symmetry-imposed selection rules. Our findings establish general principles for engineering excitonic properties in van der Waals heterostructures through controlled layer orientation and stacking order.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$), in particular, has emerged as a promising solar cell absorber. However, defective metal-semiconductor interfaces have restricted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to approximately 6%. Here we report WSe$_2$ photovoltaics with a record-high PCE of approximately 11% enabled by ultra-clean indium/gold (In/Au) van der Waals (vdW) contacts. Using grid-patterned top vdW electrodes, we demonstrate near-ideal diodes with a record-high on/off ratio of $1.0\times 10^9$. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 571 +/- 9 mV, record-high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 27.19 +/- 0.45 mA cm$^{-2}$ -- approaching the theoretical limit (34.5 mA cm$^{-2}$) -- and fill factor of 69.2 +/- 0.7% resulting in PCE of 10.8 +/- 0.2% under 1-Sun illumination on large active area (approximately 0.13x0.13 mm$^2$) devices have been realised. The excellent device performance is consistent with the high external quantum efficiency (up to approximately 93%) measured across a broad spectral range of 500-830 nm. Our results suggest that ultra-clean vdW contacts on WSe$_2$ enable high-efficiency photovoltaics and form the foundation for further optimisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main manuscript with four figures and supplementary figures</p></details> |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

However, current ab initio approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe$_2$, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s-4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Harnessing their full potential requires understanding both intrinsic transport and the dynamics of optically excited spin and charge carriers -- particularly the transition between excited spin polarization and the conduction band's intrinsic spin texture. Here, we investigate the spin polarization of the conduction bands of bulk WSe$_2$ using static and time-resolved spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, complemented by photocurrent calculations. Electron doping reveals the intrinsic spin polarization, while time-resolved measurements trace the evolution of excited spin carriers. We find that intervalley scattering is spin-conserving, with spin transport initially governed by photoexcited carriers and aligning with the intrinsic conduction band polarization after $\sim$150 fs.</p></details> |  |

This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures.

We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03361v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

Here, we demonstrate that exposing WSe$_2$ to chloroform provides simple and stable p-type doping. In monolayer WSe$_2$ transistors with Pd contacts, chloroform increases the maximum hole current by over 100$\times$ (>200 $\mu$A/$\mu$m), reduces $R_\textrm{C}$ to ~2.5 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m, and retains an on/off ratio of $10^{10}$ at room temperature. These improvements persist for over 8 months, survive annealing above 150 {\deg}C, and remain effective down to 10 K, enabling a cryogenic $R_\textrm{C}$ of ~1 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Density functional theory indicates that chloroform strongly physisorbs to WSe$_2$, inducing hole doping with minimal impact on the electronic states between the valence band and conduction band edges. Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy reveal that chloroform intercalates at the WSe$_2$ interface with the gate oxide, contributing to doping stability and mitigating interfacial dielectric disorder. This robust, scalable approach enables high-yield WSe$_2$ transistors with good p-type performance.</p></details> |  |

However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p></details> |  |

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers.

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11763v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band's natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters; 7 + 9 pages, 4 + 6 figures</p></details> |

The influence of flat electronic bands near the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^{\circ}$) on the phononic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (t-BLG) is not well understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the G and 2D Raman modes of t-BLG samples with twist angles ranging from $\sim$0.3$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$3$^{\circ}$ using micro-Raman spectroscopy. A key finding of our work is the splitting of the G mode near the magic angle due to moir\'e potential induced phonon hybridization. The linewidth of the low-frequency component of the G mode (G$^-$), as well as the main component of the 2D mode, exhibits enhanced broadening near the magic angle due to increased electron-phonon coupling, driven by the emergence of flat electronic bands. Additionally, temperature-dependent Raman measurements (6-300 K) of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene sample ($\theta_t \sim$ 1$^{\circ}$) reveal an almost tenfold increase in phonon anharmonicity-induced temperature variation in both components of the split G mode, as compared to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene sample, further emphasizing the role of phonon hybridization in this system. These studies could be important for understanding the thermal properties of the twisted bilayer graphene systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Phys....</summary><p>Phys. Rev.

Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.03139</p></details> |
| **[Negative intrinsic viscosity in graphene nanoparticle suspensions induced by hydrodynamic slip](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17397v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The viscosity of nanoparticle suspensions is always expected to increase with particle concentration. However, a growing body of experiments on suspensions of atomically thin nanomaterials such as graphene contradicts this expectation. Some experiments indicate effective suspension viscosity values that fall below that of pure solvent at high shear rates and low solid concentrations, i.e., the intrinsic viscosity is negative. To explain this puzzling phenomenon, we combined molecular dynamics and boundary integral simulations to investigate the shear viscosity of few-nanometer graphene sheets in water at high P\'eclet numbers (Pe $> 100$). Our results, covering geometric aspect ratios from 4.5 to 12.0, show robustly that the intrinsic viscosity decreases with increasing aspect ratio and becomes negative beyond a threshold aspect ratio $\approx 5.5$. We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid interface, which suppresses particle rotation and promotes stable alignment with the flow direction, thereby reducing viscous dissipation relative to dissipation in pure solvent. This slip mechanism holds for both fully 3D disc-like and quasi-2D particle geometries explored in the molecular simulations. As the concentration of graphene particles increases in the dilute regime, the viscosity initially decreases, falling below that of pure water. At higher concentrations, however, particle aggregation becomes significant, leading to a rise in viscosity after a minimum is reached. These findings confirm the occurrence of a negative intrinsic viscosity in a graphene suspension due only to hydrodynamic effects. Our work has important implications for the design of lubricants, inks, and nanocomposites with tunable viscosity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Casimir-Lifshitz force with graphene: theory versus experiment, role of spatial non-locality and of losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18651v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the impact of spatial non-locality and losses in the electromagnetic response of graphene on the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction. To this purpose, we calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plane and compare our finding with the recent experiment in PRL {\bf 126}, 206802 (2021) and PRB {\bf 104}, 085436 (2021). We calculated the CLF using three different models for the electromagnetic response of graphene: electric conductivity using a non-local and lossy Kubo model, electric conductivity using the local and lossy Kubo model, and the non-local and lossless polarization operator model. The relation between these three models has been recently explored in PRB {\bf 111}, 115428 (2025). We show that, for the parameters of the available experiments, the theoretical predictions for the Casimir-Lifshitz force using the three models are practically identical (having a relative differences smaller than $10^{-3}$). This implies that for those given experiments, both non-local and lossy effects in the graphene response are completely negligible. We also find that this experiment cannot distinguish between the Drude and Plasma prescriptions for the involved materials (gold and graphene). Our findings are relevant for present and future comparisons with experimental measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force involving graphene structures. Indeed, we show that an extremely simple local Kubo model for the electric conductivity, explicitly depending on Dirac mass, chemical potential, losses and temperature, is largely enough for a totally comprehensive comparison with typical experimental configurations. We also show how the Polarization tensor must be used and modified in general, for phenomena needing a more fine response function, i.e. requiring both the spatial non-locality and losses.</p></details> | 22 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Electron-phonon coupling in KekulÃ©-ordered graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16814v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breaking the intrinsic chirality of quasiparticles in graphene enables the emergence of new and intriguing phases. One such paradigmatic example is the bond density wave, which leads to a Kekul\'{e}-ordered structure and underpins exotic electronic states where electron-phonon interactions can play a fundamental role. Here, it is shown that the relevant physics of these correlations can be resolved locally, according to the behavior of interatomic characteristics. For this purpose a robust distance-dependent framework for describing electronic structure of graphene with Kekul\'{e} bond order is presented. Given this insight, the strength of electron-phonon interactions is found to scale linearly with the electronic coupling, contributing to a uniform picture of this relationship in distorted graphene structures. Moreover, it is shown that the introduced distortion yields a strongly non-uniform spatial distribution of the pairing strength that eventually leads to the induction of periodically distributed domains of enhanced electron-phonon coupling. These findings help elucidate certain peculiar aspects of phonon-mediated phenomena in graphene, particularly the associated superconducting phase, and offer potential pathways for their further engineering.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The formation energy of a NiFe alloy substrate and the adsorption energy of graphene on the NiFe alloy substrate are investigated by a density functional theory calculations to reveal the difference in the atomic structure of the interface between the two processes. It is found that Ni-rich surfaces are preferable for the bare substrate, whereas Fe surfaces are stable for the graphene adsorbed on the substrate. This result indicates that the composition ratio of the surface layer depends on the interface fabrication process.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

Despite the important chemical and structural disorder associated with the partial covalent bonding with the substrate, the buffer-layer carbon atoms still display quasidispersive phonons mimicking those of graphene. The related frequency softening and broadening provide a natural interpretation of the measured Raman signal. The vibrations determining thermal conduction are found to delocalize completely on the SiC substrate, leading to an effective spatial separation between material components determining, respectively, electronic and thermal transport properties. This situation opens perspectives for thermoelectric applications.</p></details> |  |

We show how the proximity between edge states from neighboring domains modifies the band structure due to the state coupling near the domain walls. The proximity-induced band deformations produce phenomena such as bulk-like dispersion that coexist with Landau levels and valley-polarized current paths. It is shown that edge state coupling can be enhanced by continuously varying the magnetic field between two non-trivial topological phases. The mechanism by which neighboring edge states modify the band structure is addressed by tracking their wave-functions over isolated bands and by analyzing the magnetic confinement potential near the domain wall. By calculating the local current density, we show that the coexistence of topological edge states with bulk-like dispersion can lead to the appearance of anti-chirality, in which co-propagating currents appear in the edges while the rest of the nanoribbon is occupied with bulk states. The appearance of anti-chirality is justified by comparing the proposed non-uniform magnetic field profile with an anti-chiral modified Haldane model.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wavevector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--P\'erot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene near the Dirac point increases conductance but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages. 7+2 figures.

Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we studied the electronic structure of graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure for twist angles of 0$^{\circ}$ and 17.5$^{\circ}$, considering both ferroelectric polarizations. We discover that switching the ferroelectric polarization reverses the sign of the charge-to-spin conversion coefficients, acting as a chirality switch of the in-plane spin texture in graphene. For the twisted heterostructure, we observed emergence of unconventional radial Rashba field for one ferroelectric polarization direction. Additionally, we demonstrated that the Rashba phase can be directly extracted from the ratio of conversion efficiency coefficients, providing a straightforward approach to characterize the in-plane spin texture in graphene. All the unique features of the studied graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure can be experimentally detected, offering a promising approach for developing advanced spintronic devices with enhanced performance and efficiency.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

The PGL structures constitute the interdigital in-plane arrays of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected by the sets of narrow constrictions, which form the graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. The PGL detector operation is associated with the rectification and hot-carrier bolometric mechanisms. The excitation of plasmonic oscillations in the GMR-GNR arrays can reinforce these mechanisms. The room temperature PGL detector responsivity and detectivity are calculated as function of the radiation frequency and device structure parameters. The effects of the rectification and hot-carrier mechanisms are compared. The PGL THz detectors under consideration can exhibit highly competitive values of responsivity and detectivity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[An Atomic Cluster Expansion Potential for Twisted Multilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15061v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twisted multilayer graphene, characterized by its moire patterns arising from inter-layer rotational misalignment, serves as a rich platform for exploring quantum phenomena. While first-principles calculations are computationally prohibitive and empirical interatomic potentials often lack accuracy, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) present a promising alternative, offering (near-)DFT accuracy at a significantly reduced computational cost. Despite their success in two-dimensional monolayer materials, MLIPs remain under-explored in twisted multilayer graphene systems. In this work, we develop an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential for simulating twisted multilayer graphene and test it on a range of simulation tasks. We propose an approach to construct training and test datasets that incorporate all possible twist angles and local stacking, including incommensurate ones. To achieve this, we generate configurations with periodic boundary conditions suitable for DFT calculations, and then introduce an internal twist and shift within those supercell structures. We further refine the dataset through active learning filtering, guided by Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our model is validated for accuracy and robustness through a wide range of numerical tests.</p></details> |  |

Zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs), in particular, exhibit an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state that transitions to a half-metallic phase under a transverse electric field or when embedded inside hexagonal Boron Nitride. Here, we consider a simple model of a heterostructure of a ZGNR with an Ising superconductor and show that, the Ising superconductor with a parent s-wave spin-singlet pairing can induce spin-triplet odd-parity pairing in the half-metallic phase of the ZGNR. The resulting superconducting phase is topologically nontrivial, with gate-tunable transitions that enable the emergence of Majorana zero modes.</p></details> |  |

Devices with four- and eight-layer differentiated contacts were analyzed, revealing that in a nanoribbon geometry (four contacts), a longitudinal counterflow current emerges in the top layer, while in a square-junction configuration (eight contacts), this counterflow is accompanied by a transverse, or Hall, component. These effects persist despite weak coupling to contacts, onsite disorder, lattice relaxation and variations in device size. The observed counterflow response indicates a circulating interlayer current, which generates an in-plane magnetic moment excited by the injected current. Finally, due to the intricate relationship between the electrical layer response, energy, and twist angle, a clusterized machine learning model was trained, validated, and tested to predict various conductances.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages and 8 figures</p></details> |

Here, the resonant Raman scattering will be utilized to study an exciton-phonon interaction in GaN nanocrystals, further enhanced by the underlying graphene. Raman spectroscopy using various excitation energies shows how the exciton-phonon interaction behaves, unveiling the scattering strength. The origin of the interaction is in the condition of resonance, which is directly observed in the temperature resolved spectra. Most importantly, the underlying graphene strongly enhances the coupling of phonons and excitons. Consequently, an enhanced resonant Raman spectrum of GaN nanocrystals possessing clearly observable phonon overtones up to the 4th order has been obtained. It has been demonstrated that the responsible effect is the electron transfer between nanocrystals and the underlying graphene. The utilization of such an increased coupling effect can be beneficial for a study of the charge carrier scattering in semiconducting nanomaterials, analysis of their crystal quality, improvement of sensor sensitivity and in the subsequent development of new-generation optoelectronic devices.</p></details> |  |

Much insight has been gained by the study of multi-component FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron contribute additional correlation. Traditional multi-component FQH states develop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and the resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature was also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study "hetero-orbital" two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part of the pseudospin, rendering the multi-component interactions strongly SU(2) anisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene at the isospin transition between N = 0 and N = 1 electron Landau levels, are markedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In particular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-flux and reverse-flux composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component 2/5 state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at a high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations, reveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects, significantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures including appendices</p></details> |

This enables the inclusion of excitonic effects in the optical phonon dispersions and lifetimes of graphene, both near the center ($\Gamma$) and at the border (K) of the Brillouin zone, at phonon momenta relevant for Raman scattering and for the onset of the intrinsic electrical resistivity. Near K, we find a phonon red-shift of ~150 $cm^{-1}$ and a 10x enhancement of the group velocity, together with a 5x increase in linewidths due to a 26x increase of the electron-phonon matrix elements. These effects persist for doping $2E_{F} < {\hbar}{\omega}_{ph}$ and are quenched at higher dopings. Near $\Gamma$, the excitonic effects are minor because of the gauge field nature of the electron-phonon coupling at small phonon momentum.</p></details> |  |

According to these authors, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". To bring the predictions of quantum field theory in agreement with those following from the Kubo model, the modified expression was used which relates the conductivity and the polarization tensor. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages; comment on arXiv:2403.02279v3</p></details> |

The epitaxial growth of Pb monolayers on SiC(0001), combined with the relatively large spacing of the suspended graphene, makes this system particularly distinctive. Using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and various microscopy techniques -- including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) -- we have investigated the intercalation process across multiple length scales. Our analysis reveals the formation of different 2D Pb monolayer phases, such as stripes and hexagons, which emerge due to the interplay between substrate pinning and strain within the Pb layer, depending on local coverage. These findings provide new insights into the strain-driven stabilization of intercalated metal layers and highlight the potential of graphene as a versatile platform for engineering low-dimensional materials.</p></details> |  |

| **[Area laws and tensor networks for maximally mixed ground states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19028v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show an area law in the mutual information for the maximally-mixed state $\Omega$ in the ground space of general Hamiltonians, which is independent of the underlying ground space degeneracy. Our result assumes the existence of a `good' approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a crucial ingredient in previous area-law proofs. Such approximations have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and 2D frustration-free locally-gapped Hamiltonians. As a corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and any bi-partition $L\cup L^c$ of the system, \begin{align*} \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} \le \mathrm O \big( \log (|L|\log(d))+\log(1/\varepsilon)\big), \end{align*} where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$, $d$ is the dimension of a site and $ \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} $ represents the $\varepsilon$-\emph{smoothed maximum mutual information} with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition in $\Omega$. From this bound we then conclude $\mathrm I (L:L^c)_\Omega \le \mathrm O\big(\log(|L|\log(d))\big)$ -- an area law for the mutual information in 1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show that $\Omega$ can be approximated in trace norm up to $\varepsilon$ with a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\mathrm{poly}(|L|/\varepsilon)$, leading to a good MPO approximation for $\Omega$ with polynomial bond dimension. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local Hamiltonians.</p></details> | 38 pages, version 2 |
| **[Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures |

| **[A minimal tensor network beyond free fermions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04216v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures + 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Superfluid dome in the spatially modulated two-dimensional XY model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16068v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In strongly correlated electron systems, superconductivity and charge density waves often coexist in close proximity, suggesting a deeper relationship between these competing phases. Recent research indicates that these orders can intertwine, with the superconducting order parameter coupling to modulations in the electronic density. To elucidate this interplay, we study a two-dimensional XY model with a periodic modulation of the coupling strength in one spatial direction. Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the modulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as the modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to an effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by a comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models. These findings shed new light on the phase behavior of intertwined superconducting and charge-ordered states, offering a deeper understanding of their complex interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures + 14 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing QUBO on a quantum computer by mimicking imaginary time evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22924v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving QUBO problems using an Imaginary Time Evolution-Mimicking Circuit (ITEMC). The circuit parameters are optimized to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, using only single- and two-qubit expectation values. This significantly reduces the measurement overhead by avoiding full energy evaluation. By updating the initial state based on results from last step iteratively, the algorithm quickly converges to the low-energy solutions. With a pre-sorting step that optimizes quantum gate ordering based on QUBO coefficients, the convergence is further improved. Our classical simulations achieve approximation ratios above 0.99 up to 150 qubits. Furthermore, the linear scaling of entanglement entropy with system size suggests that the circuit is challenging to simulate classically using tensor networks. We also demonstrate hardware runs on IBM's device for 40, 60, and 80 qubits, and obtain solutions compatible with that from simulated annealing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Magnetic Skyrmions on Kondo-type Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20897v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out-of-equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact and mean-field benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magic of the Heisenberg Picture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16047v4)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a non-stabilizerness resource theory for operators, which is dual to that describing states. We identify that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. Operationally, this measure quantifies how well an operator can be approximated by one with only a few Pauli strings -- analogous to how entanglement entropy relates to tensor-network truncation. A notable advantage of operator stabilizer entropies is their inherent locality, as captured by a Lieb-Robinson bound. This feature makes them particularly suited for studying local dynamical magic resource generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that under random evolution, operator magic typically reaches near-maximal value for all R\'enyi indices, and we evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we solve the operator stabilizer entropy for interacting integrable XXZ circuit, finding that it quickly saturates to a constant value. Overall, this measure sheds light on the structural properties of many-body non-stabilizerness generation and can inspire Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+16 ...</summary><p>5+16 Pages, 2 figures. v4: fixed mistake in Appendix</p></details> |
| **[Certifying steady-state properties of open quantum systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13646v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the steady-state properties of open many-body quantum systems is a fundamental challenge in quantum science and technologies. In this work, we present a scalable approach based on semi-definite programming to derive certified bounds on the expectation value of an arbitrary observable in the steady state of Lindbladian dynamics. We illustrate our method on a series of many-body systems, including paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains and two-dimensional ladders, considering both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady-states. We benchmark our method with state-of-the-art tensor-network approaches that, unlike our method, are only able to provide estimates, with no guarantee, on steady-state quantities. For the tested models, only modest computational effort is needed to obtain certified non-trivial bounds for system sizes intractable by exact methods. Our method introduces the first general numerical tool for bounding steady-state properties of open quantum dynamics, opening a new avenue in the understanding of stable configurations in many-body systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>See a...</summary><p>See also arXiv:2410.07384</p></details> |
| **[Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of generalized Hubbard models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10314v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison to quantum and classical Ising machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16431v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16+7 ...</summary><p>16+7 pages, 12+7 figures; close to published version</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Simulation of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics with Or-Represented Quantum Algebra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13241v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance numerical methods are essential not only for advancing quantum many-body physics but also for enabling integration with emerging quantum computing platforms. We present a scalable and general-purpose parallel algorithm for quantum simulations based on or-represented quantum algebra (ORQA). This framework applies to arbitrary spin systems and naturally integrates with quantum circuit simulation in the Heisenberg picture, particularly relevant to recent large-scale experiments on superconducting qubit processors [Kim et al., Nature 618, 500 (2023)]. As a benchmark, we simulate the kicked Ising model on a 127-qubit heavy-hexagon lattice, tracking the time evolution of local magnetization using up to one trillion Pauli strings. Executed on the supercomputer Fugaku, our simulations exhibit strong scaling up to $2^{17}$ parallel processes with near-linear communication overhead. These results establish ORQA as a practical and high-performance tool for quantum many-body dynamics, and highlight its potential for integration into hybrid quantum-classical computational frameworks, complementing recent advances in tensor-network and surrogate simulation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body systems in continuous space addressed by a tensor network approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23624v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schr\"odinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling behaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide strong numerical evidence supporting the efficiency of TN in representing continuous-space quantum wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit and offer an efficient approach to studying entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

These methods provide an exact equation which returns the optimal solution of the problems. As in other tensor network algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, the method is based on imaginary time evolution and the implementation of restrictions in the tensor network. In addition, we introduce the use of symmetries and the reutilization of intermediate calculations, reducing the computational complexity for both problems. To show the efficiency of our implementations, we carry out some performance experiments and compare the results with those obtained by other classical algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, extended version of the presented and published at the 1st International Conference on Quantum Software (IQSOFT)</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Fisher information from tensor network integration of Lyapunov equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11330v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a geometric measure of state deformation calculated along the trajectory parameterizing an ensemble of quantum states. It serves as a key concept in quantum metrology, where it is linked to the fundamental limit on the precision of the parameter that we estimate. However, the QFI is notoriously difficult to calculate due to its non-linear mathematical form. For mixed states, standard numerical procedures based on eigendecomposition quickly become impractical with increasing system size. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel numerical approach based on Lyapunov integrals that combines the concept of symmetric logarithmic derivative and tensor networks. Importantly, this approach requires only the elementary matrix product states algorithm for time-evolution, opening a perspective for broad usage and application to many-body systems. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our methodology through an illustrative example in quantum metrology, where the thermal state of the transverse-field Ising model is used to measure magnetic field amplitude.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the quantum Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism near the quantum critical point. Using the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS), we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02127v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</p></details> |  |

| **[Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06681v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 8 figures, article</p></details> |
| **[Monte Carlo Study of Critical Fermi Surface with Spatially Disordered Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13858v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Fermi liquids are an important topic in condensed matter physics, as their characteristics challenge the framework of traditional Fermi liquid theory and reveal the complex behavior of electrons in strongly interacting systems. Despite some progress in this field, linear-in-temperature resistivity and inverse-in-frequency tail of optical conductivity are unresolved issues in non-Fermi liquids. Both the experimentally observed smeared region and the theoretically predicted marginal Fermi liquid suggest that spatial disorder seems to be an important driver of these phenomena. By performing large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations in the ferromagnetic spin-fermion model at finite $N$, beyond the large-$N$ used in previous theoretical work, we investigated the role of spatial disorder in the critical Fermi surface (FS) of this model. We proposed a corrected theory of our system, which is based on a modified Eliashberg theory and a universal theory of strange metals. This theory agrees well with the data obtained from DQMC, particularly in capturing the $\omega \ln \omega$ type self-energy characteristic of marginal Fermi liquid behavior, though temperature limitations prevent us from observing the linear-in-temperature scattering rate. Our findings offer strong and unbiased validation of the universal theory of strange metals, broaden the applicability of the modified Eliashberg theory, and provide insights for numerically searching for marginal Fermi liquid and linear-in-temperature resistivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic excitations of a trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19716v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the squared sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the linear spin wave theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Non-degenerate Ground State of the Spin-Boson Model under Abelian Diagonalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14818v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudocriticality in antiferromagnetic spin chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16424v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely slow flows ("walking behavior") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$. We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$ along with an improved loop estimator for the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region $N>2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a complex CFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+11 ...</summary><p>4+11 pages, 3+7 figures</p></details> |

Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures.

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[The interplay of phase fluctuations and nodal quasiparticles: ubiquitous Fermi arcs in two-dimensional d-wave superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05376v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose that the pseudogap and Fermi arcs can universally emerge due to thermal (static) phase fluctuations in the normal state of 2D nodal superconductors. By considering a minimal phenomenological model with spatially fluctuating superconducting pairings, we theoretically investigate the role of superconducting phase fluctuations in generic 2D superconductors with disorder-average technique. It is shown for nodal d-wave superconductors that phase fluctuations mediate the scattering of d-wave quasiparticles, smearing out the nodal quasiparticle gap and further leading to pseudogap and Fermi arcs. Moreover, the evolution of Fermi arcs is quantitatively described by two emergent characteristic length scales of the system: one is the finite superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)$, and another the nodal BCS coherence length $\xi_\text{BCS}(k)$. To support our theoretical findings, we numerically report the observation of Fermi arcs in a Hubbard-like model, proposed originally by X. Y. Xu and T. Grover in Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{126}$, 217002 (2021), with sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations. As far as we noticed, it is the first time in a correlated model that Fermi arcs are identified with unbiased simulations. The numerical results for the scattering rate $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ of Cooper pairs exhibit excellent agreements with our theoretical predictions, where $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ is expected to scale linearly with the inverse superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)^{-1}$. This convergence of theory and numerics thereby strongly validates the universal connection between phase fluctuations and Fermi arcs in 2D nodal superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures for the main text; 9 pages, 5 figures for the supplementary material</p></details> |

In this work we study the Mott insulating phases of the SU(3) Hubbard model at 1/3-filling using infinite projected entangled-pair states, optimized with both imaginary time evolution and variational optimization. In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Engineering many-body quantum Hamiltonians with non-ergodic properties using quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08587v4)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a computational framework to identify Hamiltonians of interacting quantum many-body systems that host non-ergodic excited states. We combine quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the recently proposed eigenstate-to-Hamiltonian construction, which maps the ground state of a specified parent Hamiltonian to a single non-ergodic excited state of a new derived Hamiltonian. This engineered Hamiltonian contains non-trivial, systematically-obtained, and emergent features that are responsible for its non-ergodic properties. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to quantum many-body scar states where we discover a previously unreported family of Hamiltonians with spatially oscillating spin exchange couplings that host scar-like properties, including revivals in the quantum dynamics, and towers in the inverse participation ratio; and to many-body localization, where we find a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with correlated disorder that exhibits non-ergodic scaling of the participation entropy and inverse participation ratios of order unity. The method can be applied to other known ground states to discover new quantum many-body systems with non-ergodic excited states.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, including the appendix</p></details> |
| **[Tracking the variation of entanglement RÃ©nyi negativity: a quantum Monte Carlo study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10273v3)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entanglement entropy has been a powerful tool for analyzing phases and criticality in pure ground states via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement R\'enyi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Trion formation and ordering in the attractive SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12300v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in microwave shielding have increased the stability and control of large numbers of polar molecules, allowing for the first realization of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate. Remarkably, it was also recently realized that shielded polar molecules exhibit an SU(N) symmetry among their hyperfine states, opening the door to SU(N) systems with larger N, bosonic particle statistics, and tunable interactions -- both repulsive and attractive. Motivated by these results, we have studied the SU(3) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on a square lattice. Using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method, we explore the finite-temperature phase diagram and provide evidence for three distinct regions -- a three-component Fermi liquid (FL) region, a "trion" liquid (TL) region, and an ordered Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW phase is stable at finite temperature (in contrast to the SU(2) CDW), while the FL to TL crossover appears to point to a quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Our method extends straightforwardly to larger N and is sign-problem free for even values of N. With these results, we demonstrate the potential physics enabled by using polar molecules as a quantum simulation platform for the attractive SU(N) FHM.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 pages of supplemental material (with 3 supplemental figures)</p></details> |
| **[A Time-Symmetric Quantum Algorithm for Direct Eigenstate Determination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10283v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time symmetry in quantum mechanics, where the current quantum state is determined jointly by both the past and the future, offers a more comprehensive description of physical phenomena. This symmetry facilitates both forward and backward time evolution, providing a computational advantage over methods that rely on a fixed time direction. In this work, we present a nonvariational and \textit{time-symmetric quantum algorithm} for addressing the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian, leveraging the coherence between forward and backward time evolution. Our approach enables the simultaneous determination of both the ground state and the highest excited state, as well as the direct identification of arbitrary eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Unlike existing methods, our algorithm eliminates the need for prior computation of lower eigenstates, allowing for the direct extraction of any eigenstate and energy bandwidth while avoiding error accumulation. Its non-variational nature ensures convergence to target states without encountering the barren plateau problem. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the non-unitary evolution using both the linear combination of unitaries and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Our algorithm is applied to compute the energy bandwidth and spectrum of various molecular systems, as well as to identify topological states in condensed matter systems, including the Kane-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We anticipate that this algorithm will provide an efficient solution for eigenvalue problems, particularly in distinguishing quantum phases and calculating energy bands.</p></details> |  |

Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages,2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2212.01823; text overlap with arXiv:2004.10565, arXiv:2202.00542</p></details> |

| **[Accelerating ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations by delayed update and block force-bias update](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09611v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) methods have become key numerical tools for studying quantum phases and phase transitions in interacting many-fermion systems. Despite the broad applicability, the efficiency of these algorithms is often limited by the bottleneck associated with the {\it local update} of the field configuration. In this work, we propose two novel update schemes, the {\it delayed update} and {\it block force-bias update}, both of which can generally and efficiently accelerate ground-state AFQMC simulations. The {\it delayed update}, with a predetermined delay rank, is an elegantly improved version of the {\it local update}, accelerating the process by replacing multiple vector-vector outer products in the latter with a single matrix-matrix multiplication. The {\it block force-bias update} is a block variant of the conventional force-bias update, which is a highly efficient scheme for dilute systems but suffers from the low acceptance ratio in lattice models. Our modified scheme maintains the high efficiency while offering flexible tuning of the acceptance ratio, controlled by the block size, for any desired fermion filling. We apply these two update schemes to both the standard and spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional Hubbard models, demonstrating their speedup over the {\it local update} with respect to the delay rank and block size. We also explore their efficiencies across varying system sizes and model parameters. Our results identify a speedup of $\sim$$8$ for systems with $\sim$$1600$ lattice sites. Furthermore, we have investigated the broader applications as well as an application diagram of these update schemes to general correlated fermion systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

These systems serve as quantum simulators for bipartite lattices with broken sublattice symmetry, providing a platform to study the extended Hubbard model's emergent magnetic phenomena, including Lieb's magnetism at half-filling, edge depolarization upon single-electron addition, and Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Our non-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations, performed for lattices of up to 61 sites, reveal that TGQDs transition from metallic to insulating regimes as a function of site radius size, while retaining edge-polarized ground states at half-filling. Notably, edge depolarization occurs upon single-electron doping in both metallic and insulating phases, contrasting with the Nagaoka ferromagnetism observed in hexagonal armchair geometries.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Using non-perturbative dynamic cluster approximation quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we characterize the magnetic and superconducting pairing behavior of a realistic bilayer two-orbital Hubbard-Hund model of this system that describes the relevant Ni $e_g$ states with physically relevant interaction strengths. We find a leading $s^\pm$ superconducting instability in this model and show that this state primarily arises from interlayer pairing in the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital that is driven by strong interlayer spin-fluctuations in that orbital. These results provide non-perturbative evidence supporting the picture that a simple single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model for the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital provides an excellent low-energy effective description of the superconducting behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

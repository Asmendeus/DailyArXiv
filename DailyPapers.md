| **[Theoretical analysis of photon detection mechanism in superconducting single-photon detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02466v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To elucidate the photon detection mechanism of superconducting single-photon detectors, we theoretically examine the dynamics of type-II superconductors with a bias current using the two-dimensional time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau and the Maxwell equations. The photon injection that weakens the superconducting order parameter is treated phenomenologically as a local temperature increase, and the amount of injection is controlled by the initial hotspot radius. The photon is detected by the voltage change between two electrodes attached to the left and right edges of the superconductor. We find that certain parameter ranges can be explained by the traditionally considered hotspot model, while other parameter ranges are governed by the generation and annihilation of superconducting vortex and antivortex pairs. The photon detection is possible for an initial hotspot radius that exceeds a threshold value. We find that the generation of a vortex--antivortex pair occurs near the threshold. The flow of the pair perpendicular to the current direction finally creates a normal region for the photon detection. The voltage change for the Ginzburg--Landau parameter close to the transition point from type-II to type-I superconductor shows anomalous behavior that is not associated with the dynamics of the vortex--antivortex pair. We also examine the effects of spatially non-uniform current density on the voltage change and the superconducting order parameter to provide a hint to understand the behavior of wide-strip single-photon detectors. The estimated values of incident photon energy and response time for photon detection are reasonable in comparison with experiments. The present comprehensive examination provides useful guidelines for flexible design of device structures.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Spin and orbital excitations in undoped infinite layers: a comparison between superconducting PrNiO2 and insulating CaCuO2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02448v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Electronic state of superconductivity in line nodal material CaSb2 under pressure up to 4.2 GPa](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02295v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the results of resistance measurements under pressure up to $4.2\,\mathrm{GPa}$ on single-crystalline $\mathrm{CaSb}_2$ , which shows the maximum of superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ at $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. At room temperature, $R(P)$ shows a subtle anomaly at $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. However, Bloch-Gr\"uneisen analysis of $R(T)$ indicates that the electronic state does not change significantly across $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$.</p></details> | 2 pages, 2figures |
| **[Multiplexed double-transmon coupler scheme in scalable superconducting quantum processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02249v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise control of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing both quantum simulation and quantum error correction. Recently, transmon qubit systems employing the single-transmon coupler (STC) scheme have demonstrated high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gate operations by dynamically tuning the effective coupling between qubits. However, the integration of STCs increases the number of control lines, thereby posing a significant bottleneck for chip routing and scalability. To address this challenge, we propose a robust control line multiplexing scheme based on a double-transmon coupler (DTC) architecture, which enables shared coupler control lines to substantially reduce wiring complexity. Moreover, we experimentally verify that this multiplexed configuration efficiently suppresses undesirable static $ZZ$ coupling while maintaining accurate control over two-qubit gate operations. We further demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture through two distinct gate implementations: a fast coupler $Z$-control-based CZ gate and a parametric iSWAP gate. To validate the practical applicability of this multiplexing approach in quantum circuits, we prepare Bell and three-qubit GHZ states using the proposed scheme with fidelity exceeding 99% and 96%, respectively. This multiplexed DTC architecture offers significant potential to minimize wiring overhead in two-dimensional qubit arrays, thereby greatly enhancing the scalability of superconducting quantum processors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting pairing correlations on a trapped-ion quantum computer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02125v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\'s Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+63 ...</summary><p>7+63 pages, 3+29 figures</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity of bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under high pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01801v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By combining density functional theory (DFT) and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we investigate the unusual pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in the nickelate superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Using the hopping integrals and on-site potentials obtained by fitting the DFT band structures, we map a quantum phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model with increasing pressure in a ladder geometry, which has an intermediate Hubbard repulsion and a Hund's coupling. Near $3/8$ filling, we find a strong spin density wave order, which at $3/8$ filling shows a real-space spin pattern similar to the spin-charge stripe order along a lattice direction. At $21/64$ filling, we find a superconducting phase with interlayer superconductivity (SC) in both the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as in-plane SC in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Intriguingly, the SC is weakened with increasing pressure and transits to a Luttinger liquid above $80$ GPa, which qualitatively agrees with the experimental observations of decreasing $T_c$ with increasing pressure and a transition to Fermi liquid above $80$ GPa in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparative study, we further show that the ratio of interaction to hopping integral, which reduces moderately with increasing pressure, may play a dominant role in the weakening of SC. Our results of this experimentally relevant model not only find a robust SC through suppressing the competing spin density wave order, but also give new insight into the unusual pressure dependence of SC in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin correlations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ superconducting thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03178v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} > 40$ K in {\LNO} (LNO) thin films grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ (SLAO) substrate with compressive ($\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) epitaxial strain provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to unveil the dispersive spin excitations in the LNO/SLAO superconducting thin film and establish the strain dependence of the electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with strain ranging from $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$ to $+1.9\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO/SLAO thin film (with $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and spin dynamics with larger bandwidth. By contrast, tensile-strained LNO/SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon \approx +1.9\%$) exhibits a marked suppression of both the spin excitations and the Ni 3{\dz}-derived $dd$ excitations. The strain dependence of the spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, and the diminishing $dd$ excitations in tensile-strained samples indicate weaker Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. This strain evolution of the spin excitations and $J_z$ is attributed to the strain-tuned $c$-axis Ni-O-Ni bond angle $\varphi$, which controls the Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. Since superconductivity is observed only in films grown on SLAO, and spin correlations are enhanced along with the emergence of superconductivity, our results identify $\varphi$ as a key structural lever controlling $J_z$ and provide direct spectroscopic support for interlayer spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenarios in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Current-Gated Orthogonal Superconducting Transistor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01560v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonreciprocal charge transport in superconductors enables rectification but is usually limited to the longitudinal direction. In this work, we show that a direct current bias injected off principal axes in two-dimensional anisotropic superconductors converts anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, enabling supercurrent diode effect measurement. This is demonstrated within both a Ginzburg-Landau framework and self-consistent mean-field calculations. When the control bias exceeds its critical value, the transverse dissipationless currents can only flow unidirectionally. This mechanism motivates the design of a multi-terminal current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST) and yields simple, bias direction angle-dependent design rules for device optimization. As direct applications, we propose a tunable supercurrent range controller and a half-wave rectifier based on the CGOST. Our findings open new avenues for developing nonreciprocal superconducting electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, with Supplementary</p></details> |
| **[High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01551v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15147v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Source Highly Parallel Electromagnetic Simulations for Superconducting Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01220v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromagnetic simulations form an indispensable part of the design and optimization process for superconducting quantum devices. Although several commercial platforms exist, open-source alternatives optimized for high-performance computing remain limited. To address this gap, we introduce SQDMetal, a Python-based API that integrates Qiskit Metal (IBM), Gmsh, Palace (AWS), and Paraview (Kitware) into an open-source, highly parallel simulation workflow for superconducting quantum circuits. SQDMetal enables accurate, efficient, and scalable simulations while remaining community-driven and free from commercial constraints. In this work, we validate SQDMetal through mesh convergence studies which benchmark SQDMetal against COMSOL Multiphysics and Ansys, demonstrating excellent agreement for both eigenmode and electrostatic (capacitance) simulations. Furthermore, we simulate superconducting resonators and transmon qubits, showing reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. SQDMetal also supports advanced capabilities, including Hamiltonian extraction via the energy participation ratio (EPR) method, incorporation of kinetic inductance effects, and full 3D modelling of device geometry for improved predictive accuracy. By unifying open-source tools into a single framework, SQDMetal lowers the barriers to entry for community members seeking to access high-performance simulations to assist in the design and optimization of their devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point-contact enhanced superconductivity in trigonal PtBi2: quest for the origin of high-Tc](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00920v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We studied enhanced superconductivity in point contacts (PCs) based on a type-I Weyl semimetal t-PtBi2 using both normal metal (Ag, Cu, Pt) and ferromagnetic (Fe, Co, Ni) tips by measuring the differential resistance dV/dI(V) curves. In most cases, the value of the superconducting critical temperature Tc ranges between 3 and 5 K, which is several times higher than the maximal bulk Tc. At the same time, among dozens of PCs with higher Tc, a few of them reach Tc up to 8 K, including those with both normal and ferromagnetic tips. The critical magnetic field is also highly enhanced in PCs and reaches up to several Tesla. The common reason for the Tc increase may be related to pressure/strain caused at the PC's formation. Moreover, a greater increase in Tc is observed for PCs formed at the edge of the sample flake than for those formed on the plane. The results also reveal that the growth of Tc in PCs based on t-PtBi2 is compatible with ferromagnetism in Fe, Co, and Ni tips, initiating discussion as to the possible non-trivial nature of enhanced superconductivity. Anyway, our findings suggest that t-PtBi2 is a promising candidate for realizing topological superconductivity at more accessible temperatures</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, with Supplement</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing magnetic coupling in lumped element superconducting resonators for molecular spin qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00857v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to 100 kHz and collective couplings exceeding 10 MHz. The resonators were made interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single microwire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process has been used to infer the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a 50 nm wide constriction fabricated at the center of its single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by side frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instability toward Superconducting Stripe Phase in Altermagnets with Strong Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00837v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We numerically investigate finite-momentum superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric metallic altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-splitting and strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. Focusing on a stripe phase in which Cooper pairs acquire multiple center-of-mass momenta, we construct phase diagrams that reveal phase boundaries between the stripe phase and a helical phase characterized by a single center-of-mass momentum. Our results show that the stripe phase emerges at low temperatures and exhibits a reentrant behavior as a function of the strength of the altermagnetic splitting. We further analyze the stripe phase within a linearized gap equation, and uncover the mechanism of the pairing formation unique to the stripe phase. This mechanism originates from the anisotropic deformation of the Fermi surfaces induced by the altermagnetic splitting, highlighting the intriguing interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the altermagnets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Conventional and practical metallic superconductivity arising from repulsive Coulomb coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00625v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A concrete question is discussed: Can there be conventional $s$-wave superconductivity in regular 3D metals, i.e., electrons in a jellium background, interacting via the standard Coulomb coupling? We are interested in 'practical' superconductivity that can in principle be observed in experiments, so the $T=0$ ground state being superconducting is not of interest, or for that matter a $T_c$ which is exponentially small and therefore 'impractical' is also not of interest in the current work. We find that almost any theory based on the BCS-Migdal-Eliashberg paradigm, with some form of screened Coulomb coupling replacing the electron-phonon coupling in the BCS or Eliashberg theory, would uncritically predict absurdly high $T_c\sim100$ K in all metals (including the alkali metals, which are well-described by the jellium model) arising from the unavoidable fact that the Fermi, plasmon, and Coulomb potential energy scales are all $>10^4$ K. Therefore, we conclude, based on reduction ad absurdum, that the violation of the venerable Migdal theorem in this problem is sufficiently disruptive that no significance can be attached to numerous existing theoretical publications in the literature claiming plasmon-induced (or other similar Coulomb coupling-induced) practical SC. Using a careful analysis of the Eliashberg gap equations we find that the superconducting $T_c$ of the 3D electron gas can be reduced below the $\sim1$ K range depending on choices of frequency and momentum cut-off parameters that are introduced to satisfy Migdall's theorem but are apriori unknown. The only believable result is the one discovered sixty years ago by Kohn and Luttinger predicting non-$s$-wave SC arising from Friedel oscillations with exponentially (and unobservably) low $T_c$. We provide several theoretical approaches using both BCS and Eliashberg theories and different screening models to make our point.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Polariton-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00608v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) metals are altered by changes in their three-dimensional dielectric environment. In this Letter we propose that superconductivity can be induced in a 2D metal by resonant coupling between its plasmonic collective modes and optical phonons in a nearby polar dielectric. Specifically, we predict that relatively high-temperature superconductivity can be induced in bilayer graphene twisted to an angle somewhat larger than the magic value by surrounding it with a THz polar dielectric. Our conclusions are based on numerical solutions of Eliashberg equations for massless Dirac fermions with tunable Fermi velocities and Fermi energies, and can be understood qualitatively in terms of a generalized McMillan formula.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity in 1$T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00605v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity in bulk transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a fascinating area of research, as their weak interlayer coupling leads to novel superconducting behavior and offers a rich platform to host nontrivial gap structures and interactions with other electronic orders. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the superconducting properties of bulk single-crystalline $1T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$ for x = 0.2. Our results confirm the weakly coupled anisotropic superconductivity. Angle-dependent upper critical field measurements and observation of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition confirm the quasi-2D nature of the superconducting state. These results position $1T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring low-dimensional superconducting physics and highlight bulk TMD crystals as a promising platform for realizing intrinsic 2D superconductivity, opening avenues for future quantum applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Finsler geometry in anisotropic superconductivity: a Ginzburg-Landau approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19720v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a rigorous generalization of the classical Ginzburg--Landau model to smooth, compact Finsler manifolds without boundary. This framework provides a natural analytic setting for describing anisotropic superconductivity within Finsler geometry. The model is constructed via the Finsler--Laplacian, defined through the Legendre transform associated with the fundamental function F, and by employing canonical Finsler measures such as the Busemann--Hausdorff and Holmes--Thompson volume forms. We introduce an anisotropic Ginzburg--Landau functional for complex scalar fields coupled to gauge potentials and establish the existence of minimizers in the appropriate Finsler--Sobolev spaces by the direct method in the calculus of variations. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic regime as the Ginzburg--Landau parameter epsilon to 0 and prove a precise Gamma--convergence result: the rescaled energies converge to the Finslerian length functional associated with the limiting vortex filaments. In particular, the limiting vortex energy is shown to equal $\pi$ times the Finslerian length of the corresponding current, thereby extending the classical Bethuel--Brezis--He'lein result to anisotropic settings. These findings demonstrate that Finsler geometry unifies metric anisotropy and variational principles in gauge-field models, broadening the geometric scope of the Ginzburg--Landau theory beyond the Riemannian framework.</p></details> | 18 pages, 0 figures |
| **[Chimeric states of matter: Meissner effect without superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00146v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symmetry is central to how we classify phases of matter: solids break spatial translations, superfluids break particle-number conservation, and superconductors "break" gauge symmetry. Mixed anomalies involving higher-form symmetries, however, present a generalization of spontaneous symmetry breaking that admits a wider and more versatile set of possibilities. We introduce chimeric states of matter, in which aspects of broken and unbroken phases coexist. We find that the Meissner effect -- usually regarded as the defining hallmark of superconductivity -- can occur in media that are resistive or even insulating when probed by electric fields. We demonstrate this by constructing an effective field theory of "symmetry chimerization" and propose that Josephson junction networks could provide a laboratory realization. These results broaden the landscape of possible phases of matter, showing that physical media can mix features of symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken states in a single substrate.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Reducing the strain required for ambient-pressure superconductivity in bilayer nickelates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27613v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable discovery of high temperature superconductivity in bulk bilayer nickelates under high pressure has prompted the conjecture that epitaxial compressive strain might mimic essential aspects of hydrostatic pressure. The successful realization of superconductivity in films on SrLaAlO4 (001) (SLAO) supports this correspondence, yet it remains unclear whether the rich pressure-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates can be systematically mapped (and studied at ambient pressure) as a function of epitaxial strain. To this end, experimental access near the elusive edge of the superconducting phase boundary would provide invaluable insight into the nature of the superconducting state and the ground state from which it emerges. It would also offer a benchmark for theoretical models. Here we report superconducting bilayer nickelates grown on LaAlO3 (001) (LAO), where the compressive strain required for ambient-pressure superconductivity is nearly halved to -1.2%. These films exhibit a superconducting onset above 10 K and reach zero resistance at 3 K, with normal-state transport properties differing from those of films grown on SLAO. Our results offer a new opportunity to probe emergent phenomena near the superconducting phase boundary in the strain-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 42 references, 6 supplementary figures, 1 supplementary table</p></details> |

In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+11 ...</summary><p>7+11 pages, 4+7 figures</p></details> |

Using the hopping integrals and on-site potentials obtained by fitting the DFT band structures, we map a quantum phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model with increasing pressure in a ladder geometry, which has an intermediate Hubbard repulsion and a Hund's coupling. Near $3/8$ filling, we find a strong spin density wave order, which at $3/8$ filling shows a real-space spin pattern similar to the spin-charge stripe order along a lattice direction. At $21/64$ filling, we find a superconducting phase with interlayer superconductivity (SC) in both the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as in-plane SC in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Intriguingly, the SC is weakened with increasing pressure and transits to a Luttinger liquid above $80$ GPa, which qualitatively agrees with the experimental observations of decreasing $T_c$ with increasing pressure and a transition to Fermi liquid above $80$ GPa in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparative study, we further show that the ratio of interaction to hopping integral, which reduces moderately with increasing pressure, may play a dominant role in the weakening of SC.

In the large tilt limit, quenched kinetic energy leads to emergent dipole moment conservation, enabling mapping to a model generating FQH states. Using exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, and an analytical transfer matrix approach, we analyze energy and entanglement properties to reveal FQH correlations.

Upon chemical doping, two distinct types of excitonic ferromagnetism have been reported. Using steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that photo-doped half-filled systems can host nonthermal counterparts of these excitonic phases and exhibit a rich phase diagram in the space of photo-doping and crystal field splitting. Photo-doping a spin-triplet excitonic insulator provides a route towards nonequilibrium control of magnetic order.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fate and origin of the quantum Otto heat engine based on the dissipative Dicke-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27376v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dicke-Hubbard model, describing an ensemble of interacting atoms in a cavity, provides a rich platform for exploring collective quantum phenomena. However, its potential for quantum thermodynamic applications remains largely uncharted. Here, we study a quantum Otto heat engine whose working substance is a system governed by the Dicke-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Through the research on steady-state superradiance phase transitions, it is demonstrated that the steady-state synergistic mechanism under high and low temperature environments is the reason for the emergence of high-performance heat engines. By analyzing the influences of atom-light coupling strength, inter-cavity hopping strength and atom number on the working modes of quantum Otto cycle, it is clarified that the effective working regions of each working mode. This work has established a close connection between superradiance phase transition and the quantum thermodynamic applications. It not only deepens our understanding of the energy conversion mechanism in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics but also lays a theoretical foundation for the future experimental design of high-performance quantum Otto heat engines.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Dynamical control of Coulomb interactions and Hubbard bands in monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26584v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$ hosts a star-of-David charge-density wave (CDW) that stabilizes a low-temperature Mott-insulating state. Recent time-resolved spectroscopies indicate a coupling between the CDW amplitude mode and the electronic correlation strength, yet the role of the screened Coulomb interaction remains unclear. Using the constrained random-phase approximation, we show that the CDW amplitude modifies the bare and screened on-site interactions, leading to sizable variations in the effective Hubbard U. Our combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal that the Hubbard bands shift in concert with the CDW amplitude, and that a reduced distortion drives a transition from a Mott insulator to a correlated metal. These results demonstrate a direct link between lattice distortions and Coulomb interactions in transition-metal dichalcogenides, providing a microscopic mechanism for light-induced control of correlated phases in two-dimensional quantum materials.</p></details> |  |

Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p></details> | 98 pages, 75 figures |

In equilibrium, the system exhibits commensurate charge correlations consistent with the superlattice periodicity. Under laser excitation, the charge correlation function exhibits distinct behaviors across four representative frequencies, spanning both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. Notably, we observe a laser-induced commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in the charge order, manifested by a shift in the peak wavevector of the charge structure factor. This transition is driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon dynamics, where the laser frequency and intensity determine whether excitations predominantly destabilize the charge order on the weakly or strongly interacting sublattice. Our analysis of the excitation spectrum and site-resolved correlation dynamics reveals the underlying mechanisms of this transition. These results suggest a promising optical strategy for controlling charge order in superlattice-based quantum materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Within the higher-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, we find that there is no apparent finite-size boundary drift between the thermal phase and the many-body localized regime. We substantiate this observation by introducing the Van Vleck perturbation theory into the field of many-body localization. The appropriateness of this method rests largely on the peculiar Hilbert-space structure enabled by the particles' Bose statistics. The situation is reversed in the lower-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, where the significant finite-size boundary drift pushes the putative many-body localized regime up to the greater disorder strengths. We utilize the algebraic projection method to make a connection linking the disordered Bose-Hubbard model in the lower-energy section to an intricate disordered spin chain model. This issue of the finite-size drift could hence be analogous to what happens in the disordered Heisenberg chain. Both trends might be traced back to the particles' intrinsic or emergent single-occupancy constraint like the spin-$1/2$, hard-core boson, or spinless fermion degrees of freedom.</p></details> | 9 pages + 4 figures |

From approximate analytical insights based on a simple model that captures the essential physics of the doublon excitations, we show that entanglement in the initial state leads to collective enhancement of the propagation velocity $v_{\text{SU}(N)}$ when $N>2$, becoming equal to the velocity of the Bose-Hubbard model in the large-$N$ limit. These results are supported by numerical calculations of the density-density correlation in the quench dynamics for $N=2,3,4,$ and $6$.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures (Supplemental Material: 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |

However, reliable finite-temperature studies remain challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body interactions. Here, we introduce an enhanced $1\text{s}^+$ eXponential Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm that enables efficient finite-temperature simulations of the 2D Hubbard model. By exploring an expanded space, our approach achieves two-site update accuracy at the computational cost of a one-site update, and delivers up to 50% acceleration for Hubbard-like systems, which enables simulations down to $T\!\approx\!0.004t$. This advance permits a direct investigation of superconducting order over a wide temperature range and facilitates a comparison with zero-temperature infinite Projected Entangled Pair State simulations. Finally, we compile a comprehensive dataset of snapshots spanning the relevant region of the phase diagram, providing a valuable reference for Artificial Intelligence-driven analyses of the Hubbard model and a comparison with cold-atom experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures for numerical results</p></details> |

In this work, we employ projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a sign-problem-free bilayer extended Hubbard model. In this model, a charge stripe phase, characterized by a peak at momentum $k_x=2\pi\delta$ is induced by highly anisotropic interlayer spin-exchange coupling $J_z$, and strongly suppressed upon introducing the spin-flip term $J_\bot$; in contrast, \(J_\perp\) favors the emergence of interlayer pairing superconductivity. We further demonstrate that the anisotropy of the interlayer spin-exchange directly governs the competition between these two phases, while the on-site interaction \(U\) plays a complex role in tuning both the charge stripe and superconductivity. Our work identifies the key factors driving charge stripe formation, highlights the sensitivity of both the charge stripe and superconducting phases to interaction parameters, and thereby provides valuable insights into competing orders in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |

Here we consider the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice describing the hole-doped moir\'e superlattice emerging in WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer in the moderately correlated regime. By applying the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, we diagonalize the spin-valley-polarized Hamiltonian and show signatures of coexisting singlet and triplet pairings in the range of hole dopings and displacement fields reported in the experiments. In this view, we show that the superconductivity in the WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer is likely to be induced by electronic correlations and has a mixed-symmetry character. These predictions can shed light on the nature of the superconducting state observed in the twisted homobilayer of WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$. We also identify the emerging superconducting orders, which are $d_{xy}(d_{x^2-y^2} \pm id_{xy} )$ and $p_y(p_{x}\mp ip_{y})$ for the singlet and triplet channels in the cylinder of width three(four), respectively.</p></details> |  |

While many investigations have thus far focused on moire flat bands and emergent correlated electron physics in triangular, honeycomb and quasi-one-dimensional lattices, tunable moire realizations of square lattices subject to strong correlations remain elusive. Here we propose a feasible scheme to construct moire square lattice systems by twisting two or more layers of 2D materials in a rectangular lattice by 90 degrees. We demonstrate the concept with twisted GeX/SnX (X=S, Se) moire superlattices and calculate their electronic structures from first principles. We show that the lowest conduction flat band in these systems can be described by a square lattice Hubbard model with parameters which can be controlled by varying the choice of host materials, number of layers, and external electric fields. In particular, twisted double bilayer GeSe realizes a square lattice Hubbard model with strong frustration due to the next nearest neighbour hopping that could host unconventional superconductivity{, in close analogy to the Hubbard model for copper-oxygen planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors}. The presented scheme uses 90-degree twisted 2D materials with rectangular unit cells as a promising platform for realizing the physical phenomena of square lattice Hubbard models, establishing a new route for studying its rich phase diagram of magnetism, charge order, and unconventional superconductivity in a highly tunable setting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |

We analyze the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette and a density of one electron per site, where a chiral spin liquid phase may exist between weak-coupling integer quantum Hall and strong-coupling 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic phases. We use matrix product state methods and analytical arguments to investigate this model compactified to cylinders of finite circumference. We uncover a glide particle-hole symmetry operation which, we argue, is spontaneously broken at the quantum Hall to spin liquid transition on odd-circumference cylinders. We numerically verify the spontaneous symmetry breaking and further demonstrate that this transition is associated with algebraic long-range correlations of various spin-singlet, charge-neutral operators. For even-circumference cylinders, the transition becomes a crossover associated with a large correlation length that grows substantially with circumference. Our findings suggest that in the two-dimensional limit, the transition to a chiral spin liquid phase is continuous and features critical fluctuations of the current.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+17 ...</summary><p>5+17 pages, 4+9 figures</p></details> |

The condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence are computed to characterize the Mott insulator--superfluid transition. Although finite-size effects prevent a sharp transition, ground-state properties reveal signatures of quantum criticality. Thermal fluctuations can enhance coherence via tunneling, a Stark potential promotes localization, and disorder suppresses global superfluidity while preserving local coherence. These results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature reshape coherence and offer insights for quantum simulation and strongly correlated phases. For systems up to six sites with unit filling, a spectral analysis is also performed through the metric mean gap ratio (MGR). However, limited statistics due to the small system size and computational constraints prevent a complete characterization of quantum chaos, yielding only approximate signatures.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |

We present a family of hardcore Bose-Hubbard models with repulsive density-density interactions on a generalized Lieb lattice. We show that this system possesses the RSGA structure in the large interaction strength limit, exhibiting quantum HSF. It allows us to construct a set of exact condensate eigenstates, possessing off diagonal long-range order. Based on numerical simulations conducted on several representative lattices, we demonstrate the existence of weak fragmentations when the constraints are not exact. As applications, we also studied the connection between HSF and RSGA in modified fermionic Hubbard models, where the {\eta}-pairing states are shown to be energy towers, acting as quantum scars.</p></details> |  |

Through extensive calculations across various system sizes and initial states, we have demonstrated that in the strongly interacting regime, the critical singularity of dynamical quantum phase transitions exhibits consistency across different model details and initial product states (charge-density wave states). Moreover, we find that modifying the harmonic potential well not only preserves the phase transition but also enables precise control over the transition timing.</p></details> |  |

Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+4 ...</summary><p>12+4 pages, 12+7 figures</p></details> |

The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.</p></details> |  |

In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($\delta\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments.

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures with supplemental materials</p></details> |

Accompanied by an unusual pressure-induced fractionalization of Ni$^{2+}$ ionic spin from the standard spin-1 to spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, this trans-proximate correlation results from the emergence of a cross-layer trimer in our multi-energy-scale derivation of the electron dynamics. The resulting low-energy effective description resembles that of the cuprates and suggests a universal superconducting mechanism in all existing nickelate and cuprate superconductors. The rare trans-proximate correlation not only explains the weaker superconductivity in comparison with the related La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples, but it also indicates a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate by lowering layer symmetry. Such pressure-induced trans-proximate correlation is expected in many materials and examplifies the engineering of rich uncharted quantum states of matter through pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

Here, we address this by synthesizing high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$) with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice, particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$ rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm 2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the $c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/\AA, demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

The quest to understand the governing principles of RP nickelate superconductivity has become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we report a critical advance by synthesizing and investigating a distinct structural polymorph of the same compound: the monolayer-trilayer (1313) hybrid phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Under high pressure, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic $Cmmm$ to the tetragonal $P4/mmm$ space group at 13~GPa. Above 19 GPa, the phase exhibits a clear superconducting transition, confirmed by a zero-resistance state, albeit at a significantly reduced temperature of 3.6 K. The stark contrast with the 80 K transition in the bilayer phase provides a uniquely clean experimental comparison. Our results demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature is directly governed by the nature of the interlayer coupling, and the bilayer NiO$_6$ block as the essential structural motif for achieving high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity in the RP nickelates.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, supplemental material</p></details> |

Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By applying the dynamical cluster approximation and the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation, we identify an Anderson localization transition at a critical doping of $\delta \sim 0.2$ through the geometric average of the local density of states. This Anderson localization transition is the key reason for the suppression of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures and Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

Previous studies have proposed an effective d$_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model, in which the electrons of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are charge carriers, which are subject to the intralayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange $J_{\parallel}$ and the large interlayer AFM superexchange $J_{\perp}\approx 2J_{\parallel}$, with the latter transferred from the nearly half-filled and hence localized $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the strong Hund's rule coupling. Here we study this model by the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation and find a dominant interlayer s-wave pairing, in which the SC order parameters have a drastic improvement compared with those of the mean field (MF) type of theories. In real materials, the Hund's coupling is finite, leading to reduced $J_{\perp}$, dictating that the MF-type theories have difficulty explaining the HTSC. However, our VMC calculations find that even for effective $J_{\perp}$ as weak as $J_{\perp}=J_{\parallel}$, the interlayer pairing is still considerably large and can be compared with the $T_c$ observed in experiments, which is very weak in MF-type theories. This result indicates the important role of the Gutzwiller projection in improving the $T_c$, which is ignored in the MF-type theories. In addition, our results show that suppressed interlayer hopping can promote interlayer pairing, which is consistent with the fact that the interlayer hopping of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is very weak. Our research offers a new perspective for understanding the pairing mechanism of bilayer nickelates and provides a reference for recent ultra-cold atom experiments in mixed-dimensional systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

Here we propose to broadly expand the choices of materials platforms to achieve high-Tc superconducting La3Ni2O7 films by proposing designer substrates of Ba1-xSrxO (x = 0 - 1) that allow to continuously tune the strain in the films from being tensile to compressive. Our systematic study of the structural and electronic reconstructions of the strained La3Ni2O7 bilayer film leads to the central finding that at the optimal tensile strain of ~2% (x ~0.25), the spectral weight of the Ni dz2 orbital is peaked right at the Fermi level, and its hybridization with the Ni dx2-y2 orbital is substantially enhanced. Consequently, the expected Tc should be unprecedentedly high, at least substantially higher than those achieved in the compressive regime. Furthermore, our detailed thickness-dependent energetic analyses show that such films can be stably grown for thicknesses equal to or beyond the bilayer regime, and predict that the SrO-terminated SrTiO3 should also be able to stabilize the films with optimal tensile strain and higher Tc's.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the superconducting gap amplitude and symmetry, the key parameters to characterize a superconductor, remain elusive due to the overwhelming challenges of gap studies under high pressure. Here, we introduce in situ directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation, differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors. These findings set stringent constraints on theoretical models for nickelate superconductors and establish a robust spectroscopic approach for understanding superconductors under extreme pressures.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 4 supplementary figures</p></details> |

However, due to the challenges of directly probing the superconducting pairing mechanism under high pressure, the pairing symmetry and gap structures of nickelate superconductors remain under intense debate. In this work, we successfully determine the microscopic information on the superconducting gap structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ samples subjected to pressures exceeding 20~GPa, by constructing different conductance junctions within diamond anvil cells. By analyzing the temperature-dependent differential conductance spectra within the Blonder--Tinkham--Klapwijk (BTK) model, we have determined the superconducting energy gap at high pressure. The differential conductance curves reveal a two-gap structure with $\Delta_{1} = 23~\mathrm{meV}$ and $\Delta_{2} = 6~\mathrm{meV}$, while the BTK fitting is consistent with an $s$-like, two-gap spectrum. The gap ratio $2\Delta_{s1}(0) / k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{c}$ is found to be 7.61, belonging to a family of strongly coupled superconductors. Our findings provide valuable insights into the superconducting gap structures of the pressure-induced superconducting nickelates.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 pages |

Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_2$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have reported superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-delta under pressure, with zero-resistance near 80 K, though the Meissner effect remains debated due to low superconducting volume fractions and limited high-pressure magnetic measurement techniques. In this work, we use diamond quantum sensors and four-probe detection to observe both zero resistance and the Meissner effect in the same La3Ni2O7-delta single crystal. By mapping the Meissner effect, we visualized superconducting regions and revealed sample inhomogeneities. Our combined magnetic and electrical measurements on the same crystal provide dual evidence of superconductivity, supporting the high-temperature superconductivity of La3Ni2O7-delta.

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far.

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

We show that the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit $H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to $\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry. It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.</p></details> | 41pages, 14figures |
| **[Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15322v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $\chi^b > \chi^a > \chi^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $\chi^a > \chi^c > \chi^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |

In ultra-clean single crystals, we identify a field-induced phase transition within the superconducting state at 5.6 T, driven by metamagnetism. This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.</p></details> |  |

At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Magnetic penetration depth in topological superconductors: Effect of Majorana surface states and application for UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18441v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we examine how the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons and Majorana surface states influence the magnetic penetration depth in the superconductor UTe$_2$. We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($\kappa$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$\kappa$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $\kappa$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[UTe$_2$: a narrow band superconductor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07915v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted as regular article</p></details> |

We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</p></details> | 21 pages. 17 figures |

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18564v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $\Delta \lambda(T) \sim T^\alpha$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $\alpha < 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{\alpha_R}$ with $\alpha_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.</p></details> | 29 pages, 23 figures |

This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state. Taking into account the large decrease in $K_a$ in the SC state, we conclude that the $\boldsymbol{d}$ vector has components along all three crystal axes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 Figures + Supplemental Material with 18 pages, 16 Figures</p></details> |

We have investigated the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition in high-quality crystals of UTe$_2$ by tracking its signature in the magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$. A single, sharp superconducting transition is observed at low pressures 0.3 GPa. At higher pressure, a second feature emerges in $\chi(T)$, which is located at the lower-temperature thermodynamic phase boundary previously identified in specific heat measurements. This second transition anomaly in $\chi(T)$ can be attributed to a step change in the London penetration depth, providing direct evidence for a change in the superconducting order parameter of UTe$_2$. Thermodynamic constraints suggest that the low temperature, high pressure superconducting state is distinct from zero pressure superconductivity as well as from the high pressure, high temperature superconducting state, raising the possibility of multicomponent superconductivity in high pressure UTe$_2$.</p></details> |  |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Suppl.: 16 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi-liquids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982v3)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum xy model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moir\'{e} twisted bi-layer graphene and bi-layer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear in temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those due to Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln \omega_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi-surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi-surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p></details> | 65 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01738v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hopf terms are topological theta terms that are associated with a host of interesting physics, including anyons, statistical transmutation, chiral edge states, and the quantum spin-Hall effect. Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $\theta$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $\pi$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital Altermagnetism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00509v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of \emph{orbital altermagnetism}, a symmetry-protected magnetic order of pure orbital degrees of freedom. It is characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking. First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$, so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand, it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO. The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.</p></details> | 16 Page, 9 Figures |
| **[Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagomé metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting state in a kagom\'e lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |

Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagom\'e lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagom\'e lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagom\'e metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagom\'e lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |

However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120{\deg}, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Fate of chiral order and impurity self-pinning in flat bands with local symmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01780v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interacting bosons on a single plaquette threaded by a $\pi$-flux can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a chiral loop current. Connecting such bosonic $\pi$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $\pi$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04601v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loop current order on the kagome lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01648v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent discoveries in kagome materials have unveiled their capacity to harbor exotic quantum states, including intriguing charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We show that even local bond optimization can make better use of the insight it has locally into relevant loop correlations. By cutting the bond, we define a set of states whose linear dependence can be used to truncate the bond dimension. The linear dependence is eliminated with zero modes of the states' metric tensor. The method is illustrated by a series of examples for the infinite pair entangled projected state (iPEPS) and for the periodic matrix product state (pMPS) that occurs in the tensor renormalization group (TRG) step. In all examples, it provides better initial truncation errors than standard initialization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

Here, we identify QCBMs as a quantum Fourier model independently of the loss function. This allows us to apply known dequantization conditions when the optimal quantum distribution is available. However, realizing this distribution is hindered by trainability issues such as vanishing gradients on quantum hardware. Recent train-classical, deploy-quantum approaches propose training classical surrogates of QCBMs and using quantum devices only for inference. We analyze the limitations of these methods arising from deployment discrepancies between classically trained and quantumly deployed parameters. Using the Fourier decomposition of the Born rule in terms of correlators, we quantify this discrepancy analytically. Approximating the decomposition via distribution truncation and classical surrogation provides concrete examples of such discrepancies, which we demonstrate numerically. We study this effect using tensor-networks and Pauli-propagation-based classical surrogates. Our study examines the use of IQP circuits, matchcircuits, Heisenberg-chain circuits, and Haldane-chain circuits for the QCBM ansatz. In doing so, we derive closed-form expressions for Pauli propagation in IQP circuits and the dynamical Lie algebra of the Haldane chain, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | 45 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Learning the non-Markovian features of subsystem dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14133v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.</p></details> | 25 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Hadronic scattering in (1+1)D SU(2) lattice gauge theory from tensor networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00154v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a first real-time study of hadronic scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using tensor-network techniques. Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson-meson, meson-baryon, and baryon-baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g., by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.</p></details> |  |

We implement our state preparation protocol on ion-trap hardware with added noise to demonstrate the threshold behavior in a real quantum device.

In particular, attention-based architectures have demonstrated a remarkable capability to capture complex correlations and to furnish interpretable insights into latent, otherwise inconspicuous patterns. This progress motivates the application of AI techniques to the analysis of strongly correlated electrons, which remain notoriously challenging to study using conventional theoretical approaches. Here, we propose novel AI workflows for analyzing snapshot datasets from tensor-network simulations of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model over a broad range of temperature and doping. The 2D Hubbard model is an archetypal strongly correlated system, hosting diverse intriguing phenomena including Mott insulators, anomalous metals, and high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our AI techniques yield fresh perspectives on the intricate quantum correlations underpinning these phenomena and facilitate universal omnimetry for ultracold-atom simulations of the corresponding strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 34 pages, 23 figures |

We introduce Iterative-QAOA, a variant of QAOA designed to mitigate these constraints. The algorithm combines a non-variational, shallow-depth circuit approach using fixed-parameter schedules with an iterative warm-starting process. We benchmark the algorithm on Just-in-Time Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JIT-JSSP) instances on IonQ Forte Generation QPUs, representing some of the largest such problems ever executed on quantum hardware. We compare the performance of the algorithm against both the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQITE) algorithm and the non-variational Linear Ramp (LR) QAOA algorithm. We find that Iterative-QAOA robustly converges to find optimal solutions as well as high-quality, near-optimal solutions for all problem instances evaluated. We evaluate the algorithm on larger problem instances up to 97 qubits using tensor network simulations. The scaling behavior of the algorithm indicates potential for solving industrial-scale problems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p></details> |  |

Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p></details> | 98 pages, 75 figures |
| **[Fermionic dynamics on a trapped-ion quantum computer beyond exact classical simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26300v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.</p></details> | 54 pages, 43 figures |

We develop an efficient algorithm for simulating both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics in large one-dimensional quantum systems. Extending the Tensor Jump Method, which combines TDVP-based tensor-network evolution with a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of stochastic trajectories, our approach incorporates time-dependent decay rates-treating positive rates as time-inhomogeneous Markovian processes and negative rates via the Influence Martingale formalism to unravel time-local non-Markovian dynamics. This resource-efficient framework enables scalable simulations of open-system dynamics in the non-Markovian regime, as demonstrated for a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising chain comprising up to 100 spin qubits.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Heuristic Quantum Advantage with Peaked Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25838v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We design and demonstrate heuristic quantum advantage with peaked circuits (HQAP circuits) on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum processor. Through extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art classical simulation strategies, we identify a clear gap between classical and quantum runtimes. Our largest instance involves all-to-all connectivity with 2000 two-qubit gates, which H2 can produce the target peaked bitstring directly in under 2 hours. Our extrapolations from leading classical simulation techniques such as tensor networks with belief propagation and Pauli path simulators indicate the same instance would take years on exascale systems (Frontier, Summit), suggesting a potentially exponential separation. This work marks an important milestone toward verifiable quantum advantage, as well as providing a useful benchmarking protocol for current utility-scale quantum hardware. We sketch our protocol for designing these circuits and provide extensive numerical results leading to our extrapolation estimates. Separate from our constructed HQAP circuits, we prove hardness on a decision problem involving generic peaked circuits. When both the input and output bitstrings of a peaked circuit are unknown, determining whether the circuit is peaked constitutes a QCMA-complete problem, meaning the problem remains hard even for a quantum polynomial-time machine under commonly accepted complexity assumptions. Inspired by this observation, we propose an application of the peaked circuits as a potentially quantum-safe encryption scheme~\cite{chen2016report,kumar2020post,joseph2022transitioning,dam2023survey}. We make our peaked circuits publicly available and invite the community to try additional methods to solve these circuits to see if this gap persists even with novel classical techniques.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |

Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures + 7 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, their scalability is inherently constrained by exponential memory and computational overhead, which restricts accurate simulation of large-scale quantum circuits and often results in approximate output distributions. Here, we propose an exact sampling algorithm that integrates tensor network contraction techniques with a Markov process, wherein a classical state evolves according to the local structure of the quantum circuit. As a demonstration, we target the challenge of generating samples from ideal and noisy QAOA circuits with up to 476 qubits, incorporating both depolarizing and amplitude damping noise models. These results enable further validation of several assumptions and conjectures at a scale previously out of reach, significantly expanding the scope of classical simulation in quantum algorithm research.</p></details> |  |

For a given syndrome, the MWM decoder finds the most probable physical error corresponding to the MWM of the decoding graph, whereas MLD aims to find the most probable logical error. Although MLD is the optimal error correction strategy, it is typically more computationally expensive compared to the MWM decoder. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that approximates MLD with $K$ MWMs from the decoding graph. Taking the surface code subject to graphlike errors as an example, we show that it is possible to efficiently find the first $K$ MWMs by systematically modifying the original decoding graph followed by finding the MWMs of the modified graphs. For the case where the $X$ and $Z$ errors are correlated, despite the MWM of the decoding hypergraph cannot be found efficiently, we present a heuristic approach to approximate the MLD by finding the $K$ MWMs in the $X$ and $Z$ subgraphs. We benchmark the efficacy of our algorithm for the surface code subject to graphlike errors, the surface-square Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and surface-hexagonal GKP code subject to the Gaussian random displacement errors, showing that the fidelity approaches that of the exact MLD (for the first two cases) or the tensor-network decoder (for the last case) as $K$ increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Fig. 2d. 33.4 pages, 10 figures, comments are welcome!</p></details> |

While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added discussion about related and concurrent works. 12+13 pages, 5+2 figures</p></details> |

Using sign-problem-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis, we determine the long-range ordered phases as a function of the electron-phonon coupling and phonon frequency. By examining both adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, we reveal the emergence of staggered and armchair valence bond solid (VBS) phases, as well as the O(4) antiferromagnetic phase. In addition, finite-temperature simulations show that the VBS transition occurs at critical temperatures significantly higher than in models with local electron-phonon coupling, consistent with the presence of lighter polarons in the metallic regime. These findings establish the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the optical SSH model, which emphasize its similarities and contrasts with other electron-phonon systems.</p></details> | 14 Figures, 13 pages |

The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00950v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Non-perturbative Many-Body Approaches in the Exactly Solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02292v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate simulation of strongly correlated electron systems remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, motivating the development of various non-perturbative many-body methods. Such methods are typically benchmarked against the numerical exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) in the Hubbard model; however, DQMC is limited by the fermionic sign problem and the uncertainties of numerical analytic continuation. To address these issues, we use the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model as a benchmarking platform to evaluate three many-body approximations: $GW$, $HGW$, and $SGW$. We compare the Green's functions, spectral functions, and response functions obtained from these approximations with the exact solutions. Our analysis shows that the $GW$ approximation, often considered insufficient for describing strong correlation, exhibits a previously unreported solution branch that accurately reproduces Mott physics in the HK model. In addition, using a covariant formalism, we find that $HGW$ provides an accurate description of charge response, while $SGW$ performs well for spin correlations. Overall, our work demonstrates that the HK model can effectively benchmark many-body approximations and helps refine the understanding of $GW$ methods in strongly correlated regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi-Solid and Supersolid from Quasiperiodic Long-Range Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02218v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic long-range interactions defined by V_ij = V0 cos(pi * alpha * i) cos(pi * alpha * j), where alpha = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal incompressible density plateaus at incommensurate fillings tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus feature emergent nonuniform density profiles and robust long-range correlations, as captured by the structure factor. Depending on filling and interaction strength, the system realizes either a quasi-solid phase with suppressed superfluidity, a quasi-supersolid phase where density order coexists with finite superfluid density, or a superfluid phase. Our results demonstrate that purely interaction-induced quasiperiodicity, without external potential or disorder, can stabilize novel quantum phases that simultaneously break translational symmetry and sustain quantum coherence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence of charge-2$e$ bosonic carriers and pseudogaps in the dynamics of residual electrons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01742v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergence of charge-2$e$ bosonic carriers as tightly bound electrons presents perhaps the simplest route to understand the non-Fermi liquid behaviors widely observed in functional materials. However, such scenario is typically discarded when unbound electrons are observed near the chemical potential. Here, using attractive Hubbard model as a representative example, we demonstrate the emergence of such ''bosonic'' bound pairs in the presence of residual low-energy electrons through determinant quantum Monte Carlo computation of their propagators. Furthermore, above the superfluid temperature the electronic spectral function is found to display a typical non-Fermi liquid behavior, namely a pseudogap near the chemical potential. This study provides the microscopic foundation for scenarios of boson-fermion mixed liquid as effective descriptions for some of the strongly correlated functional materials.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Screening in the Heitler-London Model: Revisiting the Bonding and Antibonding States of the Hydrogen Molecule](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01132v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The present manuscript revisits one of the earliest approaches to treating molecular systems within the Schr\"odinger formalism of quantum mechanics: the Heitler-London (HL) model. Originally proposed in 1927 and based on a linear combination of atomic orbitals, the HL model provided a foundational description of covalent bonds and has served as the basis for numerous variational methods. Focusing on the hydrogen molecule, we begin by revisiting the analytical calculations of the original HL model, from which the qualitative physics of bonding and antibonding states can be obtained. Subsequently, we propose including electronic screening effects directly in the original HL wave function. We then compare our proposal with variational quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC) calculations, whose trial wave function allows us to optimize the electronic screening potential as a function of the inter-proton distance. We obtain the bond length, binding energy, and vibrational frequency of the H$_2$ molecule. Beyond revisiting this foundational approach in quantum mechanics, our proposal can serve as improved input for constructing new, but still analytically simple, variational wave functions to describe dissociation or bond formation.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, one column</p></details> |
| **[Learning phases with Quantum Monte Carlo simulation cell](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23098v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the use of the ``spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations as machine learning (ML) input data. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised ML, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions, and in a regression task to predict non-local observables. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Importantly, we illustrate a clear advantage of spin-opstring over conventional spin configurations in the accurate prediction of a quantum phase transition. Finally, we show how the inherent structure of spin-opstring provides an elegant framework for the interpretability of ML predictions. Using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the ML models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable input format for ML in quantum many-body physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 22 figures, updated to published version</p></details> |
| **[Fokker-Planck equation governing the distribution of walkers in AFQMC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19914v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is typically formulated as an open-ended random walk in an overcomplete space of Slater determinants, implemented through a Langevin equation. However, the explicit form of the underlying Fokker-Planck equation governing the walker population distribution has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation for AFQMC and propose a novel numerical scheme to solve it. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation reveals the wavefunction actually sampled by the AFQMC algorithm. Interestingly, we find that even when the exact ground state is used as a guiding wavefunction in constrained path AFQMC, contrary to the common assumption, the wavefunction sampled by AFQMC is not exact. Beyond clarifying several fundamental aspects of AFQMC, the availability of a Fokker-Planck equation formulation opens new avenues for systematically improving its accuracy, which we outline in this paper.</p></details> |  |

Here we exploit recent advances in periodic electronic structure to show that, by leveraging transfer learning starting from lower tier electronic structure methods, one can obtain machine learned potential energy surfaces for liquid water from the higher tier AFQMC, CCSD, and CCSD(T) approaches using $\le$200 energies. By performing both classical and path integral molecular dynamics simulations on these machine learned potential energy surfaces we uncover the interplay of dynamical electron correlation and nuclear quantum effects across the entire liquid range of water while providing a general strategy for efficiently utilizing periodic correlated electronic structure methods to explore disordered condensed phase systems.</p></details> |  |

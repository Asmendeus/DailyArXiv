| **[Proposal to measure the Casimir Effect Across the Superconducting Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04950v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of the superconducting transition on the Casimir effect remains experimentally elusive. We propose a novel approach to address this challenge, exploiting the first-order superconducting transition induced in a thick film by a parallel magnetic field. Our calculations for a Au sphere opposite a Pb film, based on the Mattis-Bardeen theory, predict a jump in the Casimir force across the transition. By periodically modulating the magnetic field, we induce a corresponding modulation of the Casimir force that should be readily detectable with existing micro-torsional oscillator technology, opening a promising pathway to finally observe the long-sought Casimir-superconductivity coupling. A successful measurement of this effect would provide crucial insights into the fundamental nature of the Casimir force and its interaction with macroscopic quantum phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 encapsulated figures</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Parameter Design for Superconducting Quantum Circuits with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16354v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec. Overall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing parameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which initially demonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the flat-band limit of the superconducting proximity effect in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Josephson junctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04785v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While extensively studied in normal metals, semimetals and semiconductors, the superconducting (SC) proximity effect remains elusive in the emerging field of flat-band systems. In this study we probe proximity-induced superconductivity in Josephson junctions (JJs) formed between superconducting NbTiN electrodes and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) weak links. Here the TBG acts as a highly tunable topological flat-band system, which due to its twist-angle dependent bandwidth, allows to probe the SC proximity effect at the crossover from the dispersive to the flat-band limit. Contrary to our original expectations, we find that the SC remains strong even in the flat-band limit, and gives rise to broad, dome shaped SC regions, in the filling dependent phase diagram. In addition, we find that unlike in conventional JJs, the critical current Ic strongly deviates from a scaling with the normal state conductance GN. We attribute these findings to the onset of strong electron interactions, which can give rise to an excess critical current, and also work out the potential importance of quantum geometric terms as well as multiband pairing mechanisms. Our results present the first detailed study of the SC proximity effect in the flat-band limit and shed new light on the mechanisms that drive the formation of SC domes in flat-band systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting superconductivity: how nanofaceted surfaces transform the ground state of ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-Î´}$ thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03986v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors doping is fixed during synthesis and the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed-symmetry superconductivity and the energy gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04739v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, or simply the ``gap'', provides certain constraints on the actual mechanism that gives rise to pairing and ultimately to superconductivity. In this work we continue to investigate the possible symmetries that can arise, particularly below $T_c$, for a generic tight-binding model. We first examine the 1D case to better illustrate the prevalence of symmetry-breaking transitions below $T_c$, and then the more realistic 2D case. In both cases we illustrate the implication for spectroscopic investigations of the energy gap by calculating the density of states for different temperatures below $T_c$. The result is a very different signature near $T_c$ compared to that near $T=0$. A complete picture of the superconducting symmetry can only be attained if measurements are made over the entire temperature range.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures.

| **[Anomalous nuclear spin coherence in superconducting Nb$_3$Sn](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00566v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have investigated the normal and superconducting states of the technologically important compound Nb$_3$Sn using $^{93}$Nb nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation we find strong suppression of the zero-temperature superconducting order parameter by magnetic field. We have identified an anomalously large electron-nuclear exchange interaction from spin-spin relaxation measurements, an order of magnitude beyond that of the dipole-dipole interaction, and thereby sensitive to vortex dynamics and vortex pinning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19348v4)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting critical dynamics and vortex fluctuations in a high-temperature cuprate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04439v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures in main text</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity and magnetic ordering in chalcogen-intercalated graphene bilayers with charge compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02931v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (main text), 10 pages supplemental material</p></details> |
| **[Disentangling the Impact of Quasiparticles and Two-Level Systems on the Statistics of Superconducting Qubit Lifetime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09926v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal fluctuations in the superconducting qubit lifetime, $T_1$, bring up additional challenges in building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. While the exact mechanisms remain unclear, $T_1$ fluctuations are generally attributed to the strong coupling between the qubit and a few near-resonant two-level systems (TLSs) that can exchange energy with an assemble of thermally fluctuating two-level fluctuators (TLFs) at low frequencies. Here, we report $T_1$ measurements on the qubits with different geometrical footprints and surface dielectrics as a function of the temperature. By analyzing the noise spectrum of the qubit depolarization rate, $\Gamma_1 = 1/T_1$, we can disentangle the impact of TLSs, non-equilibrium quasiparticles (QPs), and equilibrium (thermally excited) QPs on the variance in $\Gamma_1$. We find that $\Gamma_1$ variances in the qubit with a small footprint are more susceptible to the QP and TLS fluctuations than those in the large-footprint qubits. Furthermore, the QP-induced variances in all qubits are consistent with the theoretical framework of QP diffusion and fluctuation. We suggest these findings can offer valuable insights for future qubit design and engineering optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+5 p...</summary><p>6+5 pages, 3+4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Josephson effect and odd-frequency pairing in superconducting junctions with unconventional magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02679v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[From superconductivity to non-superconductivity in LiPdH: a first principle approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02252v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The layered structure of LiPdH was theoretically suggested to be a superconductor as a result of its larger electron-phonon coupling constant compared to that of PdH. However, the experimental results reported contrary findings, with no trace of superconductivity. We study the electronic, vibrational, and superconducting properties of the ambient pressure tetragonal phase of LiPdH ($P4/mmm$) within first principles density functional theory methods, both in the harmonic and anharmonic approximations for the lattice dynamics, and conclude that it does not show any superconducting behavior. High-pressure crystal structure prediction calculations indicate that no structural transition is expected to occur under pressure up to 100 GPa in LiPdH. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that increasing pressure reduces the density of states at the Fermi surface and consequently weakens electron-phonon interactions, leading to a further suppression of the superconducting critical temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting-insulating phase transition in pressurized Ba1-xKxBiO3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08406v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the first observation of a pressure-induced transition from a superconducting (SC) to an insulating (I) phase in single-crystal Ba1-xKxBiO3 (x = 0.4, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.58) superconductors. X-ray diffraction measurements conducted at 20 K reveal a direct relationship between this SC-I transition and a pressure-induced distortion of crystal structure. With increasing pressure, the lattice parameters a and c of the ambient-pressure superconducting tetragonal (T) phase are compressed continuously below a critical pressure (Pc1), wherein the pressure (P) dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) displays a small variation. However, upon further compression, the lattice of the compressed T phase displays an anisotropic change, and Tc shows a monotonous decrease. When the pressure reaches Pc2 (Pc2 > Pc1), the compressed T phase collapses along the c axis, followed by the disappearance of superconductivity and the appearance of the insulating phase. This SC-I transition is fully reversible, with the critical pressure increasing alongside K doping concentration. These findings are strikingly similar to the SC-I transition observed in hole-doped high-Tc cuprate superconductors under pressure. Identifying their commonalities could deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie high- Tc superconductivity in these two oxide superconductors with a perovskite structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Investigations of key issues on the reproducibility of high-Tc superconductivity emerging from compressed La3Ni2O7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12361v4)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the signatures of superconductivity near 80 K have been discovered in the single crystal of La3Ni2O7 under pressure, which makes it a new candidate of the high-temperature superconductors dominated by 3d transition elements after the cuprate and iron-pnictide superconductors. However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Pressure-induced structural and superconducting transitions in black arsenic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01955v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report high-pressure Raman spectra and resistance measurements of black arsenic (b-As) up to 58 GPa, along with phonon density of states (DOS) and enthalpy calculations for four reported arsenic phases up to 50 GPa. It is found that metastable b-As transforms into gray arsenic (g-As) phase at a critical pressure of 1.51 GPa, followed by subsequent transitions to simple cubic arsenic (c-As) and incommensurate host-guest arsenic (hg-As) phases at 25.9 and 44.8 GPa, respectively. Superconductivity emerges above 25 GPa in the c-As phase, with the superconducting transition temperature ($T$$\rm_c$) remaining nearly a constant of 3 K. Upon further compression, $T$$\rm_c$ steeply increases to a higher value around 4.5 K in the incommensurate hg-As phase above 43 GPa. We use our results to update the structural and superconducting phase diagrams under pressure for the novel semiconductor, black arsenic.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, accepted by Physical Review B</p></details> |
| **[Unconventional p-wave and finite-momentum superconductivity induced by altermagnetism through the formation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02059v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Altermagnet is an exotic class of magnetic materials wherein the Fermi surface exhibits a momentum-dependent spin-splitting while maintaining a net zero magnetization. Previous studies have shown that this distinctive spin-splitting can induce chiral p-wave superconductors or Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting states carrying finite momentum. However, the underlying mechanisms of such unconventional superconductivities remain elusive. Here, we propose that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) through the exchange field can play a significant role in such phenomena. Through a systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with the d-wave spin-splitting induced by the exchange field, as observed in RuO2, we demonstrate that the formation of the BFS suppresses conventional spin-singlet superconducting states with s-wave characteristics. In contrast, the chiral p-wave state maintains a fully gapped spectrum without the Fermi surface, thereby becoming the ground state in the strong field regime. In the intermediate regime, we find that the FF state becomes the predominant state through the optimization of available channels for Cooper pairing. Moreover, we illustrate how the prevalence of the chiral p-wave and FF states over the s-wave state changes under the variation of the field strength or chemical potential. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing sought-after topological p-wave superconductivity and finite momentum pairing facilitated by altermagnetism.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, (Supplementary file is included in published version)</p></details> |
| **[Creation, stabilization, and study at ambient pressure of pressure-induced superconductivity in Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01881v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In light of breakthroughs in superconductivity under high pressure, and considering that record critical temperatures (T$_c$s) across various systems have been achieved under high pressure, the primary challenge for higher Tc should no longer solely be to increase T$_c$ under extreme conditions but also to reduce, or ideally eliminate, the need for applied pressure in retaining pressure-induced or -enhanced superconductivity. The topological semiconductor Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_3$ (BST) was chosen to demonstrate our approach to addressing this challenge and exploring its intriguing physics. Under pressures up to ~ 50 GPa, three superconducting phases (BST-I, -II, and -III) were observed. A superconducting phase in BST-I appears at ~ 4 GPa, without a structural transition, suggesting the possible topological nature of this phase. Using the pressure-quench protocol (PQP) recently developed by us, we successfully retained this pressure-induced phase at ambient pressure and revealed the bulk nature of the state. Significantly, this demonstrates recovery of a pressure-quenched sample from a diamond anvil cell at room temperature with the pressure-induced phase retained at ambient pressure. Other superconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and subjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also found in BST with T$_c$ up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series. While PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both depressurization and PQP enhance its T$_c$, possibly due to microstructures formed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T$_c$. These findings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Universal Superconductivity in FeTe and All-Iron-Based Ferromagnetic Superconductor Heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01838v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ferromagnetism (FM) and superconductivity (SC) are two of the most famous macroscopic quantum phenomena. However, nature normally does not allow SC and FM to coexist without significant degradation. Here, we introduce the first fully iron-based SC/FM heterostructures, composed of Fe(Te,Se) and Fe3GeTe2, and show that in this platform strong FM and high-temperature SC robustly coexist. We subsequently discover that chemical proximity effect from neighboring layers can universally drive the otherwise non-superconducting FeTe films into a SC state. This suggests that the ground state of FeTe is so close to the SC state that it could be driven in and out of the SC state with various other perturbations. Altogether, this shows that Fe-Te-based heterostructures provide a unique opportunity to manipulate magnetism, superconductivity and topological physics, paving the way toward new superconducting technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Methods to achieve near-millisecond energy relaxation and dephasing times for a superconducting transmon qubit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18778v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting qubits are one of the most promising physical systems for implementing quantum computers. However, executing quantum algorithms of practical computational advantage requires further improvements in the fidelities of qubit operations, which are currently limited by the energy relaxation and dephasing times of the qubits. Here, we report our measurement results of a high-coherence transmon qubit with energy relaxation and echo dephasing times surpassing those in the existing literature. We measure a qubit frequency of 2.9 GHz, an energy relaxation time with a median of 425 us and a maximum of (666 +/- 33) us, and an echo dephasing time with a median of 541 us and a maximum of (1057 +/- 138) us. We report in detail our design, fabrication process, and measurement setup to facilitate the reproduction and wide adoption of high-coherence transmon qubits in the academia and industry.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Renormalization-group approach to the Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity: Amplification of the pairing gap from $\ell^4$ to $\ell$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01169v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the renormalization group (RG) analysis of the Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism for superconductivity. The KL mechanism leads to superconductivity in a system with a repulsive bare interaction. The key ingredient is the screening effect that renders the induced interaction attractive in channels with nonzero angular momentum $\ell \neq 0$, thereby triggering the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability. According to the original argument, the resulting gap is exponentially small, with its exponent scaling as $-\ell^4$. However, the KL mechanism was originally formulated within perturbation theory, where the series is known to converge poorly in certain cases -- most notably, for the p-wave paring gap induced by a repulsive s-wave contact interaction. This poor convergence may be attributed to a divergent integrand in a specific class of diagrams containing both the BCS logarithm and the Kohn anomaly, suggesting that one must resum the Kohn anomaly contributions separately from the BCS logarithm. In this work, we incorporate the Kohn anomaly contribution into the beta function of the RG equation governing the BCS instability near the Fermi surface. Our solution shows that the KL gap exponent is then proportional to $-\ell$, indicating a significant enhancement of the KL mechanism beyond the previously known result. To illustrate this, we study the spin-triplet p-wave pairing gap arising from a repulsive s-wave contact interaction and compare our RG-based results with those obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in perturbation theory.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Programming optical-lattice Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05067v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fermionic atoms in optical lattices provide a native implementation of Fermi-Hubbard (FH) models that can be used as analog quantum simulators of many-body fermionic systems. Recent experimental advances include the time-dependent local control of chemical potentials and tunnelings, and thus enable to operate this platform digitally as a programmable quantum simulator. Here, we explore these opportunities and develop ground-state preparation algorithms for different fermionic models, based on the ability to implement both single-particle and many-body, high-fidelity fermionic gates, as provided by the native FH Hamiltonian. In particular, we first design variational, pre-compiled quantum circuits to prepare the ground state of the natively implemented FH model, with significant speedups relative to competing adiabatic protocols. Besides, the versatility of this variational approach enables to target extended FH models, i.e., including terms that are not natively realized on the platform. As an illustration, we include next-nearest-neighbor tunnelings at finite dopings, relevant in the context of $d$-wave superconductivity. Furthermore, we discuss how to approximate the imaginary-time evolution using variational fermionic circuits, both as an alternative state-preparation strategy, and as a subroutine for the Quantum Lanczos algorithm to further improve the energy estimation. We benchmark our protocols for ladder geometries, though they can be readily applied to 2D experimental setups to address regimes beyond the capabilities of current classical methods. These results pave the way for more efficient and comprehensive explorations of relevant many-body phases with existing programmable fermionic quantum simulators.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Exotic localization for the bound states in the non-reciprocal two-particle Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07883v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the localization behavior of two-particle Hubbard model in the presence of non-reciprocal tunneling and non-Hermitian bound states can be obtained with strong repulsive interaction. Remarkably, the interaction induced bound state localization (BSL) can compete with non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and give rise to diverse density profiles. Via the quantum scattering methods in the center of mass frame, the system can be mapped to an effective two dimensional (2D) lattice with the two-particle interaction contributing to a defective line. For the bound states of the largest eigen-energy, in contrast to the Hermitian cases, where the maximal localization center is pinned around the center of lattice, NHSE can lead to a faded diagonal line localization. For the unbound scattering states, unlike the single corner localization in the 2D Hatano-Nelson model, interaction can force the total localization to split into multiple centers. To make the system topological nontrivial, we further include terms taking the form of two-photon tunneling and the non-Hermitian photon bound pairs are also observed, which demonstrates a competition among NHSE, BSL and edge localization. Finally, we propose the experimental simulations via the platforms of electrical circuits. Our works shed light on the crossover study of quantum optics and non-Hermitian many body physics.</p></details> |  |

Of particular interest is excitons, which are particle/hole excitations in low-dimensional systems. They are analogous to the pion in QCD, but without confinement, the question of whether they are bound and stable is of great interest in the condensed matter arena. By measuring one- and two-body correlators across various spin and isospin channels we can compute two-body energies relative to their thresholds, ultimately allowing us to check for stable states.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, contribution to the 41st International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2024), July 28th - August 3rd, 2024, Liverpool, UK</p></details> |
| **[Correlation Effects in a Simplified Bilayer Two-Orbital Hubbard Model at Half Filling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12042v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide the first experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

Band structures, ferroelectric distortions, polarization, Born effective charges, and switching barriers are calculated with extended Hubbard functionals, that are compared with those using local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and Hybrid (HSE06) functionals. The properties of all three compounds calculated by extended Hubbard functionals are in good agreement with experimental data. We find a substantial increase in band gaps due to the inter-site Coulomb interactions, which show better agreement with $GW$ results compared to those from LDA and GGA functionals. The crucial role of the inter-site Coulomb interactions in restoring the suppressed polar instability, which is computed when only the on-site Hubbard interactions are considered, is also highlighted. Overall, we find that the properties calculated using our extended Hubbard functionals exhibit trends similar to those obtained with the HSE06 functional, while reducing computational costs by over an order of magnitude. Thus, we propose that the current method is well-suited for high-throughput calculations for perovskite oxides, offering significantly improved accuracy in computing band gap and other related physical properties such as the shift current photovoltaic effect and band alignments in ferroelectric heterostructures.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Disordered Weyl semimetal as an array of coupled Hubbard chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00099v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that a disordered magnetic Weyl semimetal may be mapped onto a two-dimensional array of coupled replicated Hubbard chains, where the Hubbard $U$ is directly related to the variance of the disorder potential. This is a three-dimensional generalization of a similar mapping of the two-dimensional quantum Hall plateau transition to a one-dimensional Hubbard chain. We demonstrate that this mapping leads to the conclusion that the Weyl semimetal becomes a diffusive metal with a nonzero density of states at arbitrarily weak disorder, in agreement with recent work. We also discuss the absence of localization in strongly disordered Weyl semimetals from the viewpoint of this mapping.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+9 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Charge fluctuations, hydrodynamics and transport in the square-lattice Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04047v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling, we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the strong-coupling regimes.</p></details> | 27 pages, 23 figures |

It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U>0$ and $t>0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Machine learning Hubbard parameters with equivariant neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02457v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$) provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.</p></details> |  |

Similarly to conventional DFT, lattice DFT computes the ground-state energy of a given Hubbard model, by minimising a universal energy functional of the on-site occupations. Here we use machine learning to construct a class of scalable `semi-local' exchange-correlation functionals with an arbitrary degree of non-locality for the one-dimensional spinfull Hubbard model. Then, by functional derivative we construct an associated Kohn-Sham potential, that is used to solve the associated Kohn-Sham equations. After having investigated how the accuracy of the semi-local approximation depends on the degree of non-locality, we use our Kohn-Sham scheme to compute the polarizability of linear chains, either homogeneous or disordered, approaching the thermodynamic limit. approaching the thermodynamic limit.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |

However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Our focus is on comparing their dominant pairing symmetries. The results indicate that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is significantly enhanced at low temperatures in both doped nickelates and cuprates, whereas other typical pairing symmetries are effectively suppressed, highlighting the dominance of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing form. Additionally, we find that the effective pairing interaction for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing in doped nickelates is slightly lower than that in doped cuprates, which may be attributed to the different degrees of Fermi surface warping caused by the third-nearest hopping $t''$. Further studies show that the hole doping and interaction strength have significant effects on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction within the selected parameter range. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is notably weakened when the hole doping increases, whereas it is significantly enhanced with increasing Coulomb interaction strength $U$. This comparative analysis reveals the similarities and differences in the pairing behaviors of doped nickelates and cuprates, which may provide further insights into understanding the superconducting properties of these two classes of materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages and 12 figures.

Jan Zaanen's work played a seminal role in predicting their existence, and exploring their possible significance. They are {\it not} related to any weak-coupling physics associated with some form of Fermi-surface nesting. And whether one likes them or not, they are surprisingly difficult to avoid; in the Hubbard model, for example, they often appear as an alternative order that can out-compete the otherwise favored $d$-wave superconductivity.</p></details> |  |

The Z2 Bose-Hubbard model has been proposed to describe ultracold bosons in a dynamical optical lattice. This model introduces the lattice degrees of freedom by placing half-spins on the bonds between neighboring lattice sites. In this study, we investigate the effect of spin fluctuations on the ground state by using the density-matrix renormalization group method. By calculating the spin structure factor and the compressibility, we show that there is a phase transition between two spatially nonuniform states. We also discuss the ground state in the strong transverse magnetic field.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.</p></details> |  |

We map out the phase diagram of interlayer hybridization versus density in the regime of intermediate to strong hybridization. In particular, we found that the sufficiently strong hybridization can destroy the $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing and induces its transition to correlated metallic, pseudogap, and Fermi liquid phases depending on the doping regime. The phase diagram hosted by the bilayer model implies its role as the versatile platform to explore the pressure effects on the two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover physics of Hubbard-type models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances.

This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which allows simulation of Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and provides a framework that enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model and the PPP model. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate Hubbard models on hexagonal lattice fragments and periodic hexagonal lattices, analyze gate costs, and provide commutator bounds for evaluating Trotter errors, including new commutator bounds for the extended Hubbard model. We compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, which we optimize for the hexagonal lattice Hubbard model, and demonstrate that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures |

Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

| **[Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

The VMC results are in good agreement with the exact diagonalization (ED) calculation. For the single-hole case, the degenerate ground states are characterized by quantum numbers of a spin-1/2 and an orbital angular momentum $L_z=\pm 2$. The latter is associated with the emergent chiral spin/hole currents mutually surrounding the hole/spin-1/2 as a composite object or ``twisted hole''. A vanishing quasiparticle spectral weight is shown in the large-sample limit. In the two-hole ground state, the holes form a spin-singlet pairing with $d$+$id$ symmetry in the Cooper channel, but are of $s$-wave symmetry as a tightly bound pair of the ``twisted holes''. Such a pairing mechanism of dichotomy can be attributed to eliminating the local spin currents which has nothing to do with the long-range antiferromagnetic correlation. Superconducting ground state at finite doping is briefly discussed in terms of the tightly bound hole pairs as the building blocks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify the ground-state phase diagram across varying inter-site interactions $V$ and doping concentration $\delta$. We find that the phase diagram with finite inter-site interactions $2\lesssim V/J\lesssim3$ offers a more accurate description of electron-doped cuprates than the conventional Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models. Moreover, we reveal the role of inter-site interactions $V$ at varying doping levels: at light doping, inter-site interactions favor N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic order, and suppress both superconductivity and charge density wave; around optimal doping, these interactions support a pseudogap-like phase while suppressing superconductivity, and we further perform the slave boson mean-field analysis to understand the numerical results microscopically; at higher doping, the effects of inter-site interactions become insignificant, with our numerical predictions suggesting the emergence of incommensurate spin density wave phase. Our specific focus around optimal doping with various inter-site interactions identifies successive phases including phase separation, uniform $d$-wave SC and a pseudogap-like phase, and reveals a relative insensitivity of charge density wave to superconductivity. Our study suggests the $t$-$J$-$V$ model as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+9 p...</summary><p>7+9 pages, 6+10 figures</p></details> |

Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

We find significant hardening of optical Ni-O bond-stretching phonons when going from non-magnetic to paramagnetic state, and increasing Coulomb interaction will make them even harder. The electron correlation is found to be sensitive to the Ni-O bond-stretching distortions, indicating strong interplay between electron correlation and lattice. We find that the strong local electron correlation will not favor charge orders that couple to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons, in support of the recent experiment that a $3a_0$ charge order is absent in the infinite-layer nickelates. Our results emphasize that the effects of local magnetic fluctuations should be fully taken into account when describing the lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelates without long-range magnetic orders, and also provide evidence to ascribe the kink observed in the recent angle-resolved photoemission experiment to possible strong electron coupling to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Has b...</summary><p>Has been accepted for a publication in PRB</p></details> |

To gain deeper insights into the distinct superconducting states, it is essential to unravel the nature of the density-wave states at ambient pressure, a topic that remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the direct visualization of an incommensurate unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in real space. The density of states (DOS) is strongly depleted near $E_F$, indicating the opening of a CDW gap of $2{\Delta} \approx 71$ meV, which is unfavorable for the formation of superconductivity at ambient pressure. We propose that the CDW arises from Fermi surface nesting, and is likely a subsidiary phase of a spin density wave. Compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the weaker electronic correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is likely one reason for the lower $T_c$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved-photo-emission-spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants and is insensitive to the c-axis one. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket.

| **[Origin of the Diagonal Double-Stripe Spin-Density-Wave and Potential Superconductivity in Bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at Ambient Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14752v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with $T_c\approx 80$ K in the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has aroused great interests. Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and the potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector ${Q}\approx(0,\pm0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From the view of the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to ${Q}_0\approx\pm(0.58\pi,0.58\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by Fermi surfaces nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ much lower than that under high pressure. Further more, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC at AP.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The calculation details are improved and the format is modified</p></details> |

However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is $d_{xy}$, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged. Our work highlights the sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on low-energy electronic structure in multi-orbital superconductors, which calls for care in the downfolding procedure when one calculates their pairing symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

It is essential to search for high-temperature superconductivity in bulk samples and at ambient pressure in nickelates. In this study, we report influential factors that affect the appearance of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure. From direct-current magnetic measurements, we observe a clear diamagnetic response at 80 K in post-annealed single crystals of La3Ni2O7 in oxygen. The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be within 0.2%, resulting in a decrease in resistivity. This work presents a practical approach for further investigating high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | 4 figures, 11 pages |

Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Absence of superconductivity and density-wave transition in ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12647v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure stimulates intensive research interests. These nickelates crystallize in an orthogonal/monoclinic structure with tilted NiO$_6$ octahedra at ambient pressure and enter a density-wave-like phase at low temperatures. The application of pressure suppresses the octahedral tilting and triggers a transition to tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), which is believed to be a key prerequisite for the emergence of superconducting state. Here, by developing a high oxidative environment growth technology, we report the first tetragonal nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ microcrystals without octahedral tilting at ambient pressure. In tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, transport measurements find that both density-wave and superconducting transitions are absent up to 160 GPa, indicating a robust tetragonal metallic ground state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the band structure of ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ involves more $d_{z2}$ orbital contribution to the Fermi surface, compared to the monoclinic phase or the high-pressure superconducting tetragonal phase. The concurrent absence of density-wave state and high-pressure superconductivity in our ambient-pressure tetragonal crystals of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ suggests an underlying correlation between these two orders. It suggests that the tetragonal structure is not necessary, while the density-wave state is crucial for the superconductivity in nickelates. Our findings impose important constraints on the mechanism of pressure-induced superconductivity in nickelates and sheds new light on exploring ambient pressure high-temperature Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | submitted |

In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to the unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetic ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest the formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ simultaneously, thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, supplemental material</p></details> |

Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of heterointerfaces between 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and SrLaAlO$_4$ substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced oxygen 2p hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest pathways for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</p></details> | under review |

In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model to describe the system.

To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By analyzing the geometric average of the local density of states, we identify an Anderson localization transition occurring around $\delta \sim 0.2$.

Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 3 tables, 15 supplemental figures</p></details> |

Various theoretical approaches have been applied to the study of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, but lead to a number of contradicting results. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and at the same time particularly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as changes of the electronic structure through pressure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. Our work paves the way to understanding seemingly contradictory theoretical results within a unified framework.</p></details> |  |

However, the precise crystal structure of the superconducting phase of the layered nickelates has not been fully clarified. Here, I use first principles calculations to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in the single-layer-trilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which is one member of the layered nickelates family that also shows signatures of superconductivity. I find a nearly dispersionless nondegenerate phonon branch in the parent $P4/mmm$ phase that is unstable along the Brillouin zone edge $M$ $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ $\rightarrow$ $A$ $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ at all investigated pressures up to 30 GPa. Calculations show additional doubly-degenerate instabilities along the edge $MA$ at lower pressures. I used group-theoretical analysis to identify the distinct low-symmetry distortions possible due to these instabilities and generated them using the eigenvectors of the unstable modes. Structural relaxations show that the lowest energy structures at 0 and 10 GPa involve condensation of both the nondegenerate and doubly-degenerate instabilities, which is in contrast to the experimental refinements that involve condensation of only the doubly-degenerate branch. I also find that structural distortions are energetically favorable at 20 GPa, contrary to the experiments that do not observe any distortions of the parent $P4/mmm$ structure at high pressures.</p></details> |  |

It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures and appendix</p></details> |

The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</p></details> |  |

When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior.

In this work, we exploit the intense excitonic PL of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer combined with the high refractive index of bulk WS$_2$ to fabricate microdisk cavities with tunable light emission characteristics. These microdisks are created from a 50-nm-thick WS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure using frictional mechanical scanning probe lithography. The resulting cavities achieve a 4-10-fold enhancement in excitonic PL from the MoSe$_2$ monolayer at wavelengths near 800 nm. The excitonic PL peak is modulated by sharp spectral features, which correspond to whispering gallery modes (WGMs) supported by the cavity. A microdisk with a diameter of 2.35 $\mu$m demonstrates WGMs with a quality factor of up to 700, significantly surpassing theoretical predictions and suggesting strong potential for lasing applications. The spectral positions of the WGMs can be finely tuned by adjusting the microdisk's diameter and thickness, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. This approach offers a novel route for developing ultra-compact, all-TMDC double heterostructure light sources with record-small size.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures allow for tuning their electronic properties beyond their monolayer counterparts. We start by determining their electronic structure using density functional theory. We obtain the type-II band alignment and close in energy conduction band minima (valleys) at the $K$ and $Q$ points in the Brillouin zone. The valence band maxima, also energetically close, are located at the $K$ and $\Gamma$ points. By analyzing the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions, we describe the layer, spin, and orbital contributions. Next, we construct an \textit{ab initio}-based tight-binding model, which helps us to better understand the complexity of the interlayer interactions. We determine the effect of a vertical electric field, showing that vertical gating enables control of valleys extrema and their occupancy. Finally, we employ the tight-binding model to investigate laterally gated quantum dots and analyze the influence of a perpendicular electric field on their energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate that tuning the electric field enables control over the valley character of the quantum dot states, selectively localizing them in either the $K$ or $Q$ valleys, as evidenced by their characteristic degeneracies and wavefunctions.</p></details> |  |

In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporate the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir\'{e} unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferromagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Moreover, the hybridization of states from different layers and different valleys is allowed near the Fermi level. Those aspects are in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state.</p></details> |  |

Following earlier studies, this paper focuses on the hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer as a promising candidate for Li-decorated 2D materials. Our research reveals that lithium substitution on a selenium layer of MoSe2 can produce a hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer, which exhibits metallic behavior with potential phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.5 K. Additionally, by solving the anisotropic gap equations derived from Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we found that the Janus MoSeLi monolayer exhibits two-gap superconductivity. This finding underscores the potential of hexagonal Janus MoSeLi as a significant Li-decorated 2D material for exploring two-dimensional superconductivity and sets the stage for further investigations into new families of Janus transition-metal chalcogenides.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir\'e patterns of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H-stacking at a twist angle of 3.89$^{\circ}$ without spin-orbit coupling effect. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15$^{\circ}$. Multiple ultra-flat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7$^{\circ}$. The spin-orbit coupling leads to a giant spin splitting comparable to that observed in the untwisted system (about 0.45 eV) and is nearly independent of twisting and stacking. As a result, the K-valley flat band remains the valence band maximum with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Band unfolding reveals that the ultra-flat bands formed by the $\Gamma$ and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The $\Gamma$-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by structural reconstruction. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13$^{\circ}$) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</p></details> |  |

So far, it is assumed that the atomic reconstruction appearing in some of the heterostructures gives rise to a dominating localization of the exciton states. We demonstrate that excitonic states in reconstructed MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures can extend well beyond the moir\'e periodicity of the investigated heterostructures. The results are based on real-space calculations yielding a lateral potential map for interlayer excitons within the strain-relaxed heterostructures and corresponding real-space excitonic wavefunctions. We combine the theoretical results with cryogenic photoluminescence experiments, which support the computed level structure and relaxation characteristics of the interlayer excitons.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures based on transition-metal dichalcogenides have been extensively studied because of potential optoelectronic applications. We investigate the optical response of a light-emitting tunneling structure based on a WSe\textsubscript{2} monolayer as an active emission material using the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) experiments performed at low temperature of 5~K. We found that the application of the bias voltage allows us to change both a sign and a value of free carriers concentrations. Consequently, we address the several excitonic complexes emerging in PL spectra under applied bias voltage. The EL signal was also detected and ascribed to the emission in a high-carrier-concentration regime. The results show that the excitation mechanisms in the PL and EL are different, resulting in various emissions in both types of experimental techniques.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

The experimental findings reveal details of interlayer charge transfer on ultrafast timescales, showing that the spin-valley polarized state of photoexcited carriers is conserved during the charge transfer and formation of interlayer excitons. Our results confirm that phonon scattering mediates the interlayer charge transfer process, while a high phonon population at elevated temperatures causes a significant decrease in spin-valley selective charge transfer. Moreover, the experimental findings demonstrate the possibility that interlayer excitons and their spin-valley polarization can be probed in the optical response of intralayer excitons. These findings pave the way for ultrafast detection, control, and manipulation of spin-valley polarized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D heterostructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultrafast light-driven optical rotation and hidden orders in bulk WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06561v2)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-layer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, lacking point inversion symmetry, provide an efficient platform for valleytronics, where the electronic, magnetic, valley and lattice degrees of freedom can be selectively manipulated by using polarized light. This task is however thought to be limited in parent bulk compounds where the point inversion symmetry is restored. Exploiting the underlying quantum physics in bulk materials is thus one of the biggest paradigmatic challenges. Here we show that a sizable optical Kerr rotation can be efficiently generated in a wide energy range on ultrafast timescales in bulk WSe$_2$, by means of circularly-polarized light. We rationalize these findings as a result of the hidden spin/layer/valley quantum entanglement. The spectral analysis reveals clear features at the three characteristic frequencies corresponding to the A-, B- and C-exciton edges. The origin and the relative sign of all these features is shown to stem from the selective Pauli blocking of intralayer and interlayer optical transitions. The long lifetime of the broadband Kerr response ($\tau \sim 500$ fs) provides a strong indication that coupled photo-induced electron and hole densities survive in bulk compounds longer than previously expected. The present report demonstrates that a hidden quantum entanglement is operative also in bulk centrosymmetric layered materials, opening the way for an effective exploitation of bulk WSe$_2$ in optoelectronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+3 ...</summary><p>14+3 pages, 3+3 figures; fixed typo in the first author's name</p></details> |

In the equilibrium configuration, one of the O atoms is adsorbed on the vacancy and the other one atop one Se atom. Recombination of the CO molecule with the second of these O atoms to form CO$_2$ is a highly exothermic reaction, with an energy gain of around 3~eV. The likeliness of the CO oxidation reaction on this surface is next examined by calculating hundreds of AIMD trajectories for incidence energies that suffice to overcome the energy barriers in the entrance channel of the CO oxidative recombination. In spite of it, no CO$_2$ formation event is obtained. In most of the calculated trajectories the incoming CO molecule is directly reflected and in some cases, mainly at low energies, the molecules remain trapped at the surface but without reacting. As important conclusion, our AIMD simulations show that the recombination of CO molecules with adsorbed O atoms is a very unlikely reaction in this system, despite its large exothermicity.</p></details> |  |

The core idea of this method is to interpret the terms in the continuum model as a basis, allowing us to determine model parameters as coefficients of this basis through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We apply our method to twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ with twist angles ranging from 2.13$^\circ$ to 3.89$^\circ$, producing continuum models that exhibit excellent agreement with both energy bands and wavefunctions obtained from first-principles calculations. We further propose a strategy to integrate out the higher-energy degrees of freedom to reduce the number of the parameters in the model without sacrificing the accuracy for low-energy bands. Our findings reveal that decreasing twist angles typically need an increasing number of harmonics in the moir\'e potentials to accurately replicate first-principles results. We provide parameter values for all derived continuum models, facilitating further robust many-body calculations. Our approach is general and applicable to any commensurate moir\'e materials accessible by first-principles calculations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+47...</summary><p>14+47 pages, 5+8 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |

While considerable efforts have elucidated the Rydberg series of excitons in monolayers, understanding their properties in multilayers remains incomplete. In these structures, despite an indirect band gap, momentum-direct excitons largely shape the optical response. In this work, we combine magneto-reflectance experiments with theoretical modeling based on the $\mathbf {k\cdot p}$ approach to investigate the origin of excitonic resonances in WSe$_2$ bi-, tri-, and quadlayers. For all investigated thicknesses, we observe a series of excitonic resonances in the reflectance spectra, initiated by a ground state with an amplitude comparable to the ground state of the 1$s$ exciton in the monolayer. Higher energy states exhibit a decrease in intensity with increasing energy, as expected for the excited states of the Rydberg series, although a significant increase in the diamagnetic shift is missing in tri- and quadlayers. By comparing the experimental observations with theoretical predictions, we discover that the excitonic resonances observed in trilayers originate from two Rydberg series, while quadlayers exhibit four such series, and bilayers host a single Rydberg series similar to that found in monolayers.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 16 figures, published in Phys.

Growth temperature 500oC and gas pressure 55 sccm are found to be the optimized parameters for formation of thermodynamically stable WSe$_{2-x}$ with dominant Raman peak at 265 cm-1. XRD and HR-TEM measurement clarify the formation of high crystallinity along the c-axis and quasi-crystallinity along a and b axes respectively. Lower intensities from Raman-measurement and PL-peak at 768 nm (with 532 nm excitation wavelength) infers the thin nature of the grown film, along with strong second harmonic emission with excitation wavelength varying from 350nm to 450 nm. This work also retracks the controlled etching by reactive ions to achieve large area bi/tri-layer films to fabricate advanced devices. We also have fabricated an advanced MOS structure on SiO$_2$/p-Si substrate which shows tremendous performance by means of photo-capacitance under illumination condition where photo-carriers can survive the higher probe frequencies (> 1MHz). Under illumination condition, HfO$_2$/WSe$_2$ embedded MOS shows its dominance showing a huge electron-inversion region over HfO$_2$/ SiO$_2$/p-Si and SiO$_2$/p-Si MOS devices even at high frequencies (1-10 MHz). Thereby, this work also reveals a possible route for capacitance based highly sensitive photodetection using conventional Si-technology with integration of such WSe$_2$/W as an active material.</p></details> | 23, 7 |

There have been different realizations of bolometers using superconducting thin films, nanowires, quantum dots, and various 2D materials in the recent past. The challenge is to have a single device that combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, a fast readout mechanism, and low noise. Here we demonstrate the first usage of a Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) as a highly sensitive bolometer. Our key finding is the Kerr non-linearity of the JPA boosts the device's sensitivity. When the bolometer is biased in the non-linear regime, it enhances the sideband signals (~100 times), resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the linear regime. In the non-linear biasing of the device, we achieve a NEP~500 aW/sqrt(Hz). Our bolometer offers a fast detection scheme with a thermal time constant of 4.26 us and an intrinsic JPA time constant of 70 ns. Our device's broadband and fast operation are key and new compared to previously studied graphene-based bolometers. In our device, the gate voltage tunability and the possibility of multiplexing combined with the sensitive bolometric performance offer an opportunity for integrated quantum sensor arrays. Our work demonstrates a way forward to enhance the performance of quantum sensors based on 2D materials by leveraging the inherent non-linear response.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the flat-band limit of the superconducting proximity effect in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Josephson junctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04785v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While extensively studied in normal metals, semimetals and semiconductors, the superconducting (SC) proximity effect remains elusive in the emerging field of flat-band systems. In this study we probe proximity-induced superconductivity in Josephson junctions (JJs) formed between superconducting NbTiN electrodes and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) weak links. Here the TBG acts as a highly tunable topological flat-band system, which due to its twist-angle dependent bandwidth, allows to probe the SC proximity effect at the crossover from the dispersive to the flat-band limit. Contrary to our original expectations, we find that the SC remains strong even in the flat-band limit, and gives rise to broad, dome shaped SC regions, in the filling dependent phase diagram. In addition, we find that unlike in conventional JJs, the critical current Ic strongly deviates from a scaling with the normal state conductance GN. We attribute these findings to the onset of strong electron interactions, which can give rise to an excess critical current, and also work out the potential importance of quantum geometric terms as well as multiband pairing mechanisms. Our results present the first detailed study of the SC proximity effect in the flat-band limit and shed new light on the mechanisms that drive the formation of SC domes in flat-band systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasiperiodic pairing in graphene quasicrystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05714v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting instabilities of twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals (TBGQC) obtained by stacking two monolayer graphene sheets with a $30^\circ$ relative twisting. The electronic energy spectrum of TBGQC contains periodic energy ranges (PER) and quasiperiodic energy ranges (QER), where the underlying local density of states (LDOS) exhibits periodic and quasiperiodic distribution, respectively. We found that superconductivity in the PER is a simple superposition of two monolayer superconductors. This is because, particularly near the charge neutrality point of TBGQC, the two layers are weekly coupled, leading to pairing instabilities with uniform distribution in real space. On the other hand, within QER, the inhomogeneous distribution of the LDOS enhances the superconducting instability with a non-uniform distribution of pairing amplitudes, leading to quasiperiodic superconductivity. Our study can qualitatively explain the superconductivity in recently discovered moir\'e quasicrystals, which show superconductivity in its QER.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a version before proof</p></details> |
| **[Twisted Bilayer Graphene in Commensurate Angles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12344v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of ``magic angles" in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has spurred extensive research into its electronic properties. The primary tool for studying this thus far has been the famous Bistritzer-MacDonald model (BM model), which relies on several approximations. This work aims to build the first steps in studying magic angles without using this model. Thus, we study a 2d model for TBG in both AA and AB stacking \emph{without} the approximations of the BM model in the continuum setting, using two copies of a potential with the symmetries of graphene, either sharing a common origin (in AA stacking) or with shifted origins (in AB stacking), and twisted with respect to each other. Our results hold for a wide class of potentials in both stacking types. We describe the angles for which the two twisted lattices are commensurate and prove the existence of Dirac cones in the vertices of the Brillouin zone for such angles. Furthermore, we show that for small potentials, the slope of the Dirac cones is small for commensurate angles that are close to incommensurate angles. This work is the first to establish the existence of Dirac cones for twisted bilayer graphene (for either stacking) in the continuum setting without relying on the BM model. This work is the first in a series of works to build a more fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of magic angles.</p></details> |  |

The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (main text), 10 pages supplemental material</p></details> |

Unlike ordinary graphene plasmons, these magnetoplasmonic surface waves are characterized by a band gap corresponding to the cyclotron frequency. In addition, these magnetoplasmon bands are topological, characterized by a non-zero Chern number. This leads to the existence of topologically protected edge states at domain edges where the Chern number changes. Since the Chern number is dependent on the direction of the magnetic field, edge states exist at domain edges across which the magnetic field flips direction. Physically, the magnetic field can only flip direction at gradual domain edges with finite width creating topological heterojunctions. These topological heterojunctions support extra edge states known as Volkov-Pankratov edge states which can enter the band gap and support propagation in both directions. The number of Volkov-Pankratov states at a heterojunction varies as a function of the width of the gradual domain edge.</p></details> |  |

However, to realize devices, it is indispensable to gain control over the interaction of the active layer with the substrate, and to protect it from environmental influences. Here we show that a single layer of elemental Bi, formed by intercalation of an epitaxial graphene buffer layer on SiC(0001), is a promising candidate for a QSHI. This layer can be reversibly switched between an electronically inactive precursor state and a ``bismuthene state'', the latter exhibiting the predicted band structure of a true two-dimensional bismuthene layer. Switching is accomplished by hydrogenation (dehydrogenation) of the sample, i.e., a partial passivation (activation) of dangling bonds of the SiC substrate, causing a lateral shift of Bi atoms involving a change of the adsorption site. In the bismuthene state, the Bi honeycomb layer is a prospective QSHI, inherently protected by the graphene sheet above and the H-passivated substrate below. Thus, our results represent an important step towards protected QSHI systems beyond graphene.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, supplementary information</p></details> |

While it is well-established that protons show an affinity to the air-water interface, a critical knowledge gap exists in technologically relevant surfaces like the graphene-water interface. Here we use machine learning-based simulations with first-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of the hydroxide and hydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that protons accumulate at the graphene-water interface, with the hydronium ion predominantly residing in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion exhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and towards the interior layers. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals local polarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement. Proton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation of surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for ion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing a low-energy continuum model, we investigate the band structure and perform a comprehensive topological characterization of the system by analysing the direct band gap closing as well as various Chern numbers. In the absence of SOC, the tDBLG exhibits characteristics of a valley Hall insulator. However, in the presence of SOC, we observe a transition to a quantum spin Hall insulator state and band topology emerges in the parameter spaces of non-topological regime without SOC. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis between untwisted double bilayer graphene and tDBLG to assess the impact of twisting on the system's properties. Our findings reveal the construction of topological phase diagrams that showcase distinct phases arising from changes in the twist angle compared to the untwisted case. These phase diagrams provide valuable insights into the diverse topological phases achievable in tDBLG with SOC. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the interplay between small twist angle, SOC, and external electric field on the topological band properties of twisted multilayer graphene systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the published version</p></details> |

We apply the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of two graphene layers twisted with respect to each other by a small angle. By reducing the model to the Dirac-type one with modified Fermi velocity, we derive expressions for the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin interactions using perturbation theory for the free energy. The biquadratic interaction is suppressed by a larger power of the interaction constant and decreases faster with a the distance between impurities comparing to the quadratic one. Nevertheless, due to the different period of oscillations with impurity separation distance, chemical potential, twist angle and temperature, it is possible to fine-tune the system to the regime of dominating biquadratic interaction. Such a regime might be characterized by non-conventional spin order parameters such as quadrupole order.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Graphene intercalation of the large gap quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01592v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene, a two-third monolayer of bismuth on SiC(0001), is distinguished by helical metallic edge states that are protected by a groundbreaking 800 meV topological gap, making it ideal for room temperature applications. This massive gap inversion arises from a unique synergy between flat honeycomb structure, strong spin orbit coupling, and an orbital filtering effect that is mediated by the substrate. However, the rapid oxidation of bismuthene in air has severely hindered the development of applications, so far confining experiments to ultra-high vacuum conditions. Here, we successfully overcome this barrier, intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a protective sheet of graphene. As we demonstrate through scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, graphene intercalation preserves the structural and topological integrity of bismuthene, while effectively shielding it from oxidation in air. We identify hydrogen as the critical component that was missing in previous bismuth intercalation attempts. Our findings facilitate ex-situ experiments and pave the way for the development of bismuthene based devices, signaling a significant step forward in the development of next-generation technologies.</p></details> |  |

In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) at proximity was shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG). We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with Tc = 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase and observed the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is significantly enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD - opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages; 4 figures, 1 table, 9 extended data figures; Nature Materials (2025, in press)</p></details> |
| **[Elastic Screening of Pseudogauge Fields in Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02250v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice deformations in graphene couple to the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom as effective scalar and gauge fields. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the optical component of the displacement field, i.e., the relative motion of different sublattices, contributes at equal order as the acoustic component and effectively screens the pseudogauge fields. In particular, we consider twisted bilayer graphene and corrugated monolayer graphene. In both cases, optical lattice displacements significantly reduce the overall magnitude of the pseudomagnetic fields. For corrugated graphene, optical contributions also reshape the pseudomagnetic field and significantly modify the electronic bands near charge neutrality. Previous studies based on continuum elasticity, which ignores this effect, have therefore systematically overestimated the strength of the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field. Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of experiments and design of straintronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 + 1...</summary><p>7 + 15 pages, 4 + 12 figures</p></details> |

By construction of topological flat band with moire engineering, intrinsic FCIs have been observed in twisted MoTe2 system and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices with anomalous Hall resistivity quantization number C <= 2/3 including the gapless composite Fermi-liquid state with C = 1/2. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new system of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG)/hBN moire superlattices, which exhibit both integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects with rich tunability including electric displacement field, perpendicular magnetic field and in-plane magnetic field. By tuning the electrical and magnetic fields at 0 < v < 1, we have observed a quantum phase transition showing a sign reversal of the Hall resistivity at finite magnetic fields. Surprisingly, the FCI state at v = 2/3 survives in the phase transitions, exhibiting a robust quantized Hall resistivity across both phases. Finally we have further demonstrated the indispensable role moire potential plays in the formation of the flat Chern band from a theoretical perspective. Our work has established RHG/hBN moire superlattices as a promising platform for exploring quasi-particles with fractional charge and non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field.</p></details> |  |

One particularly puzzling observation is the transition between the EQAH and FCI regimes, driven either by temperature or electrical current. Here we propose a scenario to understand these transitions based on the topologically protected gapless edge modes that are present in both the FCI and EQAH phases and should be most relevant at temperature scales below the energy gap. Our consideration is based on the simple assumption that the edge velocity in FCI is smaller than that in EQAHE and thus contributes to a higher entropy. We further argue that domains with opposite fractionally quantized Hall conductance are ubiquitous in the devices due to disorder, which gives rise to a network of edge modes. The velocity of the edge modes between domains is further reduced due to edge reconstruction. The edge velocity can also be reduced by current when the occupation of the edge mode approaches the gap edge. The edge entropy therefore drives the transition from EQAH to FCI either by temperature or current at a nonzero temperature.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, typos fixed and reference updated, published in PRB as an Editors' Suggestion</p></details> |

The electronic properties are described by a Hubbard model with long range tunneling matrix elements. The electronic properties are obtained by solving the mean field Hubbard model. We obtain the bandstructure with characteristic flat bands and a Dirac cone. At charge neutrality, turning on electron-electron interactions results in metallic to antiferomagnetic phase transition, for Hubbard interaction strength considerably smaller than in other graphene multilayers. We analyze the stability of the antiferromagnetic state against the symmetry breaking induced by hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation, and mirror symmetry breaking caused by the application of electric fields that mix the Dirac cone with the flat bands. Additionally, we explore the topological properties of the system, revealing a hidden quantum geometry. Despite the flat bands having zero Chern numbers, the multiband Berry curvature distribution over the moir\'e Brillouin zone exhibits a non-trivial structure. Finally, we propose a mechanism to tune this quantum geometry, providing a pathway to control the system's topological properties.</p></details> |  |

Using the Floquet approach and the Dirac equation, we derive the energy spectrum solutions. The scattering coefficients are calculated explicitly by matching the eigenspinors at the GQD interfaces, revealing a dependence on several physical parameters. In addition, we compute the scattering efficiency, the electron density distribution, and the lifetime of the quasi-bound states. Our numerical results show that the presence of an energy gap and circularly polarized laser irradiation enhances the localization of the electron density within the GQDs, leading to an increase in the lifetime of the quasi-bound states. In particular, the intensity and polarization of the light influence the scattering process, allowing the manipulation of the electron confinement state. These results highlight the importance of combining magnetic fields and polarized light to control electronic transport in graphene nanostructures.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02670v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor changes to a substantially updated version that emphasizes: discrepancy between theoretical and experimental onsite U; emergent f-electron potential phenomenologically introduced to model the chemical potential resets; auxiliary rotor mean-field method to capture the normal state physics; and two temperature scales in the system due to two competing fixed points. 18+7 pages, 23+3 figures</p></details> |

Tensor networks (TNs) have gained prominence in recent years in modeling classical systems with quantum-inspired approaches. More recently, TN generative-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) has been proposed as a strategy which uses generative modeling to efficiently sample valid solutions with respect to certain constraints of optimization problems. Moreover, it has been shown that symmetric TNs (STNs) can encode certain constraints of optimization problems, thus aiding in their solution process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of TN- and STN-GEO to an industry relevant problem class, a multi-knapsack problem, in which each object must be assigned to an available knapsack. We detail a prescription for practitioners to use the TN-and STN-GEO methodology and study its scaling behavior and dependence on its hyper-parameters. We benchmark 60 different problem instances and find that TN-GEO and STN-GEO produce results of similar quality to simulated annealing.</p></details> |  |

We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09738v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures. v2: minor edits. v3: stronger statement regarding ruling out possibilities of quantum advantage</p></details> |

The approach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study the dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the initial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant dependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their symmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with longer range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor Ising model.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 28 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[TensorQC: Towards Scalable Distributed Quantum Computing via Tensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03445v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A quantum processing unit (QPU) must contain a large number of high quality qubits to produce accurate results for problems at useful scales. In contrast, most scientific and industry classical computation workloads happen in parallel on distributed systems, which rely on copying data across multiple cores. Unfortunately, copying quantum data is theoretically prohibited due to the quantum non-cloning theory. Instead, quantum circuit cutting techniques cut a large quantum circuit into multiple smaller subcircuits, distribute the subcircuits on parallel QPUs and reconstruct the results with classical computing. Such techniques make distributed hybrid quantum computing (DHQC) a possibility but also introduce an exponential classical co-processing cost in the number of cuts and easily become intractable. This paper presents TensorQC, which leverages classical tensor networks to bring an exponential runtime advantage over state-of-the-art parallelization post-processing techniques. As a result, this paper demonstrates running benchmarks that are otherwise intractable for a standalone QPU and prior circuit cutting techniques. Specifically, this paper runs six realistic benchmarks using QPUs available nowadays and a single GPU, and reduces the QPU size and quality requirements by more than $10\times$ over purely quantum platforms.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

This enables an efficient branch-and-bound search (within the probability space) that exploits the locality of the underlying problem's topology.

Although many advanced approaches have been proposed and recently used to challenge quantum advantage experiments, novel efficient methods for the approximate simulation of complex quantum systems are still in high demand. Here we propose a scalable technique for approximate simulations of intermediate-size quantum circuits on the basis of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and Riemannian optimization. The MERA is a tensor network, whose geometry together with orthogonality constraints imposed on its tensors allow approximating many-body quantum states lying beyond the area-law scaling of the entanglement entropy. We benchmark the proposed technique for brick-wall quantum circuits of up to 243 qubits with various depths up to 20 layers.

While widely applied in the study of optical quantum circuits, such as Boson Sampling, existing tensor network approaches fail to address the complexity mismatch between tensor contractions and the calculation of photon-counting probability amplitudes. Here, we present an alternative tensor network framework, the operator-basis Matrix Product State (MPS), which exploits the input-output relations of quantum optical circuits encoded in the unitary interferometer matrix. Our approach bridges the complexity gap by enabling the computation of the permanent -- central to Boson Sampling -- with the same computational complexity as the best known classical algorithm based on a graphical representation of the operator-basis MPS that we introduce. Furthermore, we exploit the flexibility of tensor networks to extend our formalism to incorporate partial distinguishability and photon loss, two key imperfections in practical interferometry experiments.

Nonetheless, there is still a need to simulate large quantum systems classically, as the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are yet to be considered fault tolerant and performant enough in terms of operations per second. Each of the two main exact simulation techniques, state vector and tensor network simulators, boasts specific limitations. The exponential memory requirement of state vector simulation, when compared to the qubit register sizes of currently available quantum computers, quickly saturates the capacity of the top HPC machines currently available. Tensor network contraction approaches, which encode quantum circuits into tensor networks and then contract them over an output bit string to obtain its probability amplitude, still fall short of the inherent complexity of finding an optimal contraction path, which maps to a max-cut problem on a dense mesh, a notably NP-hard problem. This article aims at investigating the limits of current state-of-the-art simulation techniques on a test bench made of eight widely used quantum subroutines, each in 31 different configurations, with special emphasis on performance. We then correlate the performance measures of the simulators with the metrics that characterise the benchmark circuits, identifying the main reasons behind the observed performance trend. From our observations, given the structure of a quantum circuit and the number of qubits, we highlight how to select the best simulation strategy, obtaining a speedup of up to an order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Rev. B {\bf 107}, 205123 (2023) against two-dimensional classical 3-state clock model. Due to the higher complexity of the model, more complicated crossover behavior is observed. We advocate that the crossover behavior can be understood from the perspective of finite bond dimension inducing relevant perturbation. This leads to a general strategy to best estimate the critical properties for a given set of control parameters. For the critical temperature $T_c$, the relative error at the order of $10^{-7}$ can be reached with bond dimension $D=70$. On the other hand, with bond dimension $D=60$, the relative errors of the critical exponents $\nu, \beta, \alpha$ are at the order of $10^{-2}$. Increasing the bond dimension to $D=90$, these relative errors can be reduced at least to the order of $10^{-3}$. In all cases our results indicate that the errors can be systematically reduced by increasing the bond dimension and the stacking number.</p></details> |  |

Unlike other physics-inspired approaches to optimization problems, such as quantum annealing and quantum computing, VeloxQ does not require substantial progress of technology to unlock its full potential. We benchmark VeloxQ against the state-of-the-art QUBO solvers based on emerging technologies. Our comparison includes quantum annealers, specifically D-Wave's Advantage, and Advantage2 prototype platforms, the digital-quantum algorithm designed to solve Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) developed by Kipu Quantum, physics-inspired algorithms: Simulated Bifurcation and Parallel Annealing and an algorithm based on tropical tensor networks. We also take into account modern developments of conventional algorithms: Branch and Bound algorithm, an optimal implementation of the brute-force algorithm and BEIT QUBO solver. Our results show that VeloxQ not only matches but often surpasses the mentioned solvers in solution quality and runtime. Additionally, VeloxQ demonstrates excellent scalability being the only solver capable of solving large-scale optimization problems, including up to $2\times 10^{8}$ sparsely connected variables, that are currently intractable for its competitors. These findings position VeloxQ as a powerful and practical tool for tackling large-scale QUBO and HUBO problems, offering a compelling alternative to existing quantum and classical optimization methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies suggest that embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits and initializing the parameters can avoid the barren plateau. Yet, embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits is generally difficult, and methods have been limited to the simplest structure, Matrix Product States (MPSs). This study proposes a method to embed Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs), characterized by their hierarchical structure, into shallow quantum circuits. TTNs are suitable for representing two-dimensional systems and systems with long-range correlations, which MPSs are inadequate for representing. Our numerical results show that embedding TTNs provides better initial quantum circuits than MPS. Additionally, our method has a practical computational complexity, making it applicable to a wide range of TTNs. This study is expected to extend the application of VQAs to two-dimensional systems and those with long-range correlations, which have been challenging to utilize.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Regularized second-order optimization of tensor-network Born machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18691v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor-network Born machines (TNBMs) are quantum-inspired generative models for learning data distributions. Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function that is commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability, efficiency, and generalization.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18688v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phases with topological order exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: States with the same topological order are distinguished by how their anyonic excitations transform under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological phases. In this work, we develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune between wavefunctions of different symmetry fractionalization. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are completely immobile as individual particles. By deforming the local tensors that describe the ground state of the fixed point model, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions have non-vanishing correlation lengths and are non-stabilizer states. At the critical points between the phases, power-law correlations are supported in certain spatial directions. Furthermore, based on the isoTNS description of the wavefunction, we determine a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme for which a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays suffices to encode the three-dimensional state using measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order based on the language of tensor networks and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order with quantum processors.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

| **[Non-linear Quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05094v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mean of a random variable can be understood as a $\textit{linear}$ functional on the space of probability distributions. Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating $\textit{non-linear}$ functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al.. The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors. A key innovation of our approach is a new sequence of multilevel Monte Carlo approximations specifically designed for quantum computing, which is central to the algorithm's improved performance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

While scaling corrections have been shown to play important roles in fully characterizing equilibrium quantum criticality, their impact on nonequilibrium critical dynamics has not been extensively explored. In this work, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in a two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model. We find that in this model the scaling corrections arising from both finite system size and finite driving rate must be incorporated into the finite-time scaling form in order to properly describe the nonequilibrium scaling behaviors. In addition, improved scaling relations are obtained from the expansion of the full scaling form. We numerically verify these scaling forms and improved scaling relations for different starting states using the nonequilibrium quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Of particular interest is excitons, which are particle/hole excitations in low-dimensional systems. They are analogous to the pion in QCD, but without confinement, the question of whether they are bound and stable is of great interest in the condensed matter arena.

| **[Correlation Effects in a Simplified Bilayer Two-Orbital Hubbard Model at Half Filling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12042v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01264v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Quantum State Study of Fracton Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11677v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 21 figures, (Re-)Submission to SciPost Added X-cube simulations, extended Figure 9 (and additional Figure 20), added references</p></details> |
| **[Particle-wave dichotomy in quantum Monte Carlo: unlocking the quantum correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03298v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here, a dichotomy of particles and waves is employed in a quantum Monte Carlo calculation of interacting electrons. Through the creation and propagation of concurrent stochastic ensembles of walkers in physical space and in Hilbert space one can correctly predict the ground state and the real-time evolution of a single electron interacting with larger quantum system. It is shown that such walker ensembles can be constructed straightforwardly through a stochastic sampling (windowing) applied to the mean-field approximation. Our calculations reveal that the ground state and the real-time evolution of the probability distributions and the decoherence due to the Coulomb interaction in presence of strong ultrashort laser pulse can be accounted for correctly by calculating the density matrix of the electron, without referencing to the quantum many-body state of the whole system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+9 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Charge fluctuations, hydrodynamics and transport in the square-lattice Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04047v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling, we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the strong-coupling regimes.</p></details> | 27 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18937v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave functions in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Efficient calculation of trion energies in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09376v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reduced dielectric screening in atomically thin semiconductors leads to remarkably strong electron interactions. As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schr\"odinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges) via the Land\'e subtraction method. Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

This problem is known to depend on the choice of representation basis. We propose a systematic approach for mitigating the sign problem independent of the given Hamiltonian or lattice structure. We first introduce the concept of negativity to characterize the severity of the negative sign problem. We then demonstrate the existence of a locally defined quantity, the L1 adaptive loss function, which effectively approximates negativity, especially in frustration-free systems. Using the proposed loss function, we demonstrate that optimizing the representation basis can mitigate the negative sign. This is evidenced by several frustration-free models and other important quantum spin systems. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unitary transformations against the standard orthogonal transformation and reveal that unitary transformations can effectively mitigate the sign problem in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures.

This method consistently provides more accurate energy estimates than coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), often regarded as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. This level of precision is achieved at a lower asymptotic computational cost, scaling as $O(N^6)$ compared to the $O(N^7)$ scaling of CCSD(T). We provide numerical evidence supporting these findings through results for challenging main group and transition metal-containing molecules.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15428v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</p></details> |  |

The recently devised time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method allows a self-consistent treatment of the system of particles together with bath oscillators first for imaginary-time propagation of Schroedinger type of equations where both the system and the bath converge to their finite temperature ground state, and next for real time calculation where the dissipative dynamics is demonstrated. In that context the application of TDQMC appears as promising alternative to the path-integral related techniques where the real time propagation can be a challenge.</p></details> |  |

By solving concurrently sets of up to 20 000 coupled 3D time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the guide waves and corresponding sets of first order equations of motion for the Monte Carlo walkers we obtain ground state energies in close agreement with the exact values. The combined use of spherical coordinates and B-splines along the radial coordinate proves to be especially accurate and efficient for such calculations. Our results for the dipole response and the ionization of an atom with un-correlated electrons are in good agreement with the predictions of the conventional time-dependent Hartree-Fock method while the calculations with correlated electrons show enhanced ionization that is due to the electron-electron repulsion.</p></details> |  |

The adhesion potential between graphene and hBN is calculated as a function of local lattice offset using diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods, which provide an accurate treatment of van der Waals interactions. Combining the adhesion potential with elasticity theory, we determine the relaxed structures of graphene and hBN layers at interfaces, finding no metastable structures. The adhesion potential is well described by simple Lennard-Jones pair potentials that we parameterize using our quantum Monte Carlo data. Encapsulation of graphene between near-aligned crystals of hBN gives rise to a moir\'{e} pattern whose period is determined by the misalignment angle between the hBN crystals superimposed over the moir\'{e} superlattice previously studied in graphene on an hBN substrate. We model minibands in such supermoir\'{e} superlattices and find them to be sensitive to a 180$^\circ$ rotation of one of the encapsulating hBN crystals. We find that monolayer and bilayer graphene placed on a bulk hBN substrate and bulk hBN/graphene/bulk hBN systems do not relax to adopt a common lattice constant. The energetic balance is much closer for free-standing monolayer graphene/hBN bilayers and hBN/graphene/hBN trilayers. The layers in an alternating stack of graphene and hBN are predicted to strain to adopt a common lattice constant and hence we obtain a new, stable three-dimensional crystal with a unique electronic structure.</p></details> |  |

We identify the critical gate distance below which the Wigner crystal phase disappears. For larger gate distances, the system undergoes a re-entrant transition from crystal to liquid at sufficiently low density. We also present preliminary evidence for a fully polarized ferromagnetic liquid state at low electron density and intermediate gate distances. The quantum Monte Carlo results are compared with simpler approximate methods, which are shown to be semi-quantitatively reliable for determining key features of the phase diagram. These methods are then used to obtain the phase boundary between the Wigner crystal and liquid in the single-gate geometry.</p></details> | 4+4 pages |

The exponential-time scaling inherent to the quantum many-body problem is reduced to polynomial-time computation by solving concurrently a set of coupled Schroedinger equations for the guide waves in physical space and a set first order equations for the Monte Carlo walkers. We use effective potentials to accounts for the local and nonlocal quantum correlations in time-varying fields, where for fermionic states an exchange 'hole' is introduced explicitly through screened Coulomb potentials. The walker distributions for the ground states of para- and ortho-helium reproduce well the statistical properties, such as the electron-pair density function, of the real atoms. Our predictions for the dipole response and the ionization of an atom exposed to strong ultrashort optical pulse are in good agreement with the exact results.</p></details> |  |

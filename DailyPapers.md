| **[Flat-band (de)localization emulated with a superconducting qubit array](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07878v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits are analog quantum simulators able to emulate a wide range of tight-binding models in parameter regimes that are difficult to access or adjust in natural materials. In this work, we use a superconducting qubit array to emulate a tight-binding model on the rhombic lattice, which features flat bands. Enabled by broad adjustability of the dispersion of the energy bands and of on-site disorder, we examine regimes where flat-band localization and Anderson localization compete. We observe disorder-induced localization for dispersive bands and disorder-induced delocalization for flat bands. Remarkably, we find a sudden transition between the two regimes and, in its vicinity, the semblance of quantum critical scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, and Supplementary Information</p></details> |
| **[Spin Liquid and Superconductivity emerging from Steady States and Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07125v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that, starting with a simple fermion wave function, the steady mixed state of the evolution of a class of Lindbladians, and the ensemble created by strong local measurement of fermion density without post-selection can be mapped to the "Gutzwiller projected" wave functions in the doubled Hilbert space -- the representation of the density matrix through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. A Gutzwiller projection is a broadly used approach of constructing spin liquid states. For example, if one starts with a gapless free Dirac fermion pure quantum state, the constructed mixed state corresponds to an algebraic spin liquid in the doubled Hilbert space. We also predict that for some initial fermion wave function, the mixed state created following the procedure described above is expected to have a spontaneous "strong-to-weak" U(1) symmetry breaking, which corresponds to the emergence of superconductivity in the doubled Hilbert space. We also design the experimental protocol to construct the desired physics of mixed states.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, more results and new authors added</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Topological Superconductivity via Berry Curvature Effects in Spectral Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02165v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experimental efforts on topological superconductivity (TSC) have primarily focused on the detection of Majorana boundary modes, while the bulk properties of TSC - particularly in two dimensions (2D) - remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we theoretically propose a distinctive signature in the spectral function away from the boundaries, capable of detecting 2D chiral p-wave TSC induced in a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) heterostructure. This signature can be probed experimentally through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy or momentum- and energy-resolved tunneling spectroscopy under a weak magnetic field B. We show that within the topological phase, the spectral intensity of the lowest superconducting band at small momenta k~0 brightens (darkens) linearly with increasing B, whereas it darkens (brightens) in the trivial phase when the Rashba system is electron- (hole-) doped. This sharp contrast arises from the phase-space Berry curvature (BC) of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, a novel quantum geometric property that generalizes the conventional momentum-space BC. The effect of this phase-space BC can also be detected by the differential conductance away from the boundaries. Our falsifiable prediction provides an experimental avenue for detecting Rashba-induced chiral p-wave TSC without relying on Majorana mode detection, addressing a key challenge in the realization of 2D TSC.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Cosmic muon flux attenuation methods for superconducting qubit experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04938v5)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and demonstrate two practical mitigation methods to attenuate the cosmic muon flux, compatible with experiments involving superconducting qubits: shallow underground sites and specific device orientation. Using a specifically-built cosmic muon detector, we identify underground sites, widely present in urban environments, where significant attenuation of cosmic muon flux, up to a factor 35 for 100-meter depths, can be attained. Furthermore, we employ two germanium wafers in an above-ground laboratory, each equipped with a particle sensor, to show how the orientation of the chip with respect to the sky affects the amount and type of energy deposited on the substrate by ionizing radiation. We observe that the horizontal detector sees more counts at lower energy, while the vertical one is impacted by more particles at higher energy. The methods here described proposed ways to directly understand and reduce the effects of cosmic rays on qubits by attenuating the source of this type of decoherence, complementing existing on-chip mitigation strategies. We expect that both on-chip and off-chip methods combined will become ubiquitous in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubit circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fractional-flux oscillations of Josephson critical currents in multi-gap superconductors: a test for unconventional superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09964v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Josephson-junction interferometry has played a pivotal role in uncovering unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates. Using a Ginzburg-Landau-like approach, we generalize previous results to the genuine multi-gap case. Thus, we show that fractional flux oscillations of the Josephson critical current can arise as a direct consequence of multi-gap superconductivity. These oscillations reveal key information about the underlying superconducting states, including the unconventional $s_\pm$-wave state. Thus, our findings suggest new phase-sensitive experiments to characterize the Cooper pairing of new emerging superconductors such as the nickelates.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Removal of excess iron by annealing processes and emergence of bulk superconductivity in sulfur-substituted FeTe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09945v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are several strategies to discover new superconductors. Growing new materials and applying high pressures can be the classic ways since superconductivity was found. Also, chemical processing, such as annealing, is another way to induce superconductivity in a non-superconducting material. Here, we show chemical processing effects in the non-superconducting material, sulfur-substituted FeTe. It has been known that superconductivity in S-substituted FeTe is induced by O$_2$ annealing. We revealed that hydrochloric acid etching and vacuum annealing for O$_2$-annealed samples made the quality of superconductivity higher by several physical property measurements. Furthermore, we visualized the superconducting regions by a magneto-optical imaging technique, indicating that the superconductivity in the processed sample was bulk. In this sample, we confirmed that the concentration of excess iron was reduced compared to that in the as-grown state. These results provide an important route to bulk superconductivity in S-substituted FeTe and its related iron-based compounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Phys.

| **[Superconductivity and a van Hove singularity confined to the surface of a topological semimetal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09878v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between electronic topology and superconductivity is the subject of great current interest in condensed matter physics. For example, superconductivity induced on the surface of topological insulators is predicted to be triplet in nature, while the interplay between electronic correlations and topology may lead to unconventional superconductivity as in twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we unveil an unconventional two-dimensional superconducting state in the recently discovered Dirac nodal line semimetal ZrAs2 which is exclusively confined to the top and bottom surfaces within the crystal's ab plane. As a remarkable consequence of this emergent state, we observe a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, the hallmark of two-dimensional superconductivity. Notably, this is the first observation of a BKT transition on the surface of a three-dimensional system. Furthermore, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we find that these same surfaces also host a two-dimensional van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. The proximity of van Hove singularity to the Fermi level leads to enhanced electronic correlations contributing to the stabilization of superconductivity at the surface of ZrAs2, a unique phenomenon among topological semimetals. The surface-confined nature of the van Hove singularity, and associated superconductivity, realized for the first time, opens new avenues to explore the interplay between low-dimensional quantum topology, correlations, and superconductivity in a bulk material without resorting to the superconducting proximity effect.</p></details> | in press |
| **[Unveiling resilient superconducting fluctuations in atomically thin NbSe$_2$ through Higgs mode spectroscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09868v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a combined electrical transport and optical study of the superconductivity in atomically thin NbSe$_2$. When subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field, an anomalous metallic state emerges, characterized by a finite longitudinal resistance and a vanishing Hall resistance, suggesting the presence of particle-hole symmetry. We establish a superconducting Higgs mode in atomically thin samples, which reveals enduring superconducting fluctuations that withstand unexpectedly high reduced magnetic fields. These findings provide evidence of robust locally paired electrons in the anomalous metallic state, affirming its bosonic nature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting diode efficiency from singlet-triplet mixing in disordered systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09421v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) -- the nonreciprocity of the critical current in a bulk superconductor -- has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in superconducting electronics. However, the role of disorder scattering in SDE has rarely been considered, despite its potential qualitative impact, as we demonstrate in this work. We investigate SDE in a disordered Rashba superconductor under an in-plane magnetic field, employing a self-consistent Born approximation to derive the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis reveals two surprising effects. First, in the weak Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) regime, disorder can reverse the direction of the diode effect, indicated by a sign change in the superconducting diode efficiency coefficient. Second, in the strong Rashba SOC regime, disorder becomes the driving mechanism of SDE, which vanishes in its absence. In this case, we show that disorder-induced mixing of singlet and triplet superconducting orders underlies the effect.</p></details> | 9 figures, 14 pages |
| **[Orbital-selective correlation effects and superconducting pairing symmetry in a multiorbital $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09195v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ raises key questions about its mechanism and the nature of pairing symmetry. This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Extended strange metal regime from superconducting puddles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08699v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a model of mesoscale superconducting puddles in a metal, represented as dynamical impurities interacting with a finite number of electronic channels via Andreev and normal scattering. We identify conditions under which the collection of puddles make a $T$-linear contribution to the resistivity and a $T\ln(1/T)$ to the specific heat and thermopower. This behavior emerges in an intermediate temperature range that extends from an upper energy scale set by the renormalized charging energy of the puddles, and down to an exponentially small scale associated with a charge-Kondo crossover, provided that the number of electronic channels interacting with the puddle is large. The phenomenology of our model resembles the apparent extended strange metal regime observed in overdoped cuprates which exhibits $T$-linear resistivity at low $T$ over a finite range of doping. We also propose to engineer a strange metal from suitably designed superconducting grains in a metallic matrix.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+14 ...</summary><p>7+14 pages, 3+5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Phonon-mediated spin-polarized superconductivity in altermagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08704v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the possibility of phonon-mediated unconventional superconductivity in a recently discovered new class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets. Within a weak-coupling approach, and using a minimal Lieb lattice model for altermagnets, we find a dominant superconducting instability odd in momentum and even in spin with spin-polarized Cooper pairs. We discuss the origin of this unusual result in terms of the spin-structure of the altermagnetic Fermi surface, in combination with the momentum-space structure of the effective phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions on the Fermi surface.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+7 p...</summary><p>6+7 pages, 4+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity of Bad Fermions: Origin of Two Gaps in HTSC Cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08635v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the spectral properties of the doped ${t-t'}$ Hubbard model with parameters typical for high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Our approach is based on a novel strong-coupling Green's function expansion around a reference system -- the exactly solvable undoped particle-hole symmetric Hubbard lattice -- that possesses a large antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard-Slater gap in the electron spectrum. The electron spectral function in the case of a large next-nearest-neighbor hopping ${t'=-0.3t}$, which is characteristic of the ${T_c \approx 100\,\text{K}}$ family of cuprates, reveals a strongly renormalized flat band feature with a pseudogap around the antinodal point. The superconducting response of this system to a small ${d_{x^2-y^2}}$-like external field exhibits a very unusual form. It features a pseudogap at the antinodal point in the normal part of the Nambu Green's function, related to a ``bad-fermion'' behavior in a normal phase, as well as a ${d}$-wave-like structure in the anomalous (Gorkov's) Green's function, with zero response at the nodal point of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, we find that the anomalous part of the response deviates essentially from the simplest ${(\cos{k_x}-\cos{k_y})}$ form in momentum space. Specifically, its extrema are shifted away from the ${(\pi,0)}$ and ${(0,\pi)}$ points due to suppression of the response by the pseudogap. The observed two-gap structure of the electron spectra in a generic strong-coupling model of cuprates can serve as a basis for phenomenological treatment of different physical properties of high-temperature superconductors within two-fluid model.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Non-Reciprocal Current-Phase Relation and Superconducting Diode Effect in Topological-Insulator-Based Josephson Junctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08527v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Josephson junctions (JJ) are essential for superconducting quantum technologies and searches of self-conjugate quasiparticles, pivotal for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) in JJ based on topological insulators (TI) can provide critical insights into unconventional phenomena in these systems, such as the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS) and the nature of non-reciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field in such JJs has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we introduce a platform for precise CPR measurements in planar JJs composed of NbSe$_2$ and few layer thick Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (TI) as a function of magnetic field. When a single flux quantum $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip-shaped CPR behaviour and non-reciprocal supercurrent flow. We demonstrate that these anomalies stem from the edge-amplified sloped supercurrent profile rather than MBS signatures often invoked to explain puzzles emerging near $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ in TI-based JJ. Furthermore, we show that such a supercurrent profile gives rise to a previously overlooked, robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. These findings establish field-dependent CPR measurements as a critical tool for exploring topological superconducting devices and offer new design principles for non-reciprocal superconducting electronics.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08459v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</p></details> |  |
| **[Laser-Induced Relaxation Oscillations in Superconducting Nanobridge Single Photon Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09494v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate novel laser-induced relaxation oscillations in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). These oscillations appear when a voltage biased NbTiN nanobridge detector is illuminated with intense pulsed laser light at a repetition rate of ~19 MHz. They differ from the well-known relaxation oscillations by a step-wise increase in frequency and phase locking of the oscillations to the laser pulses. An electrical model that does not include thermal effects can be used to simulate the observed laser-induced relaxation oscillations. Good agreement to the experiment is achieved using realistic values for the parameters in the model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interlayer interactions in $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under pressure: from $s^{\pm}$ to $d_{xy}$-wave superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08425v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the role of \emph{interlayer} interaction terms in the competition between different superconducting gap symmetries in the bilayer nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under high pressure. We study a two-layer, two-orbital electron model that encompasses both intra- and interlayer Coulomb interaction terms within the matrix random-phase approximation. We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures + Supp. Material</p></details> |

Using a quasiclassical, non-Markovian theoretical model, we demonstrate that coherent microwave photon generation can emerge solely from heat flow through the circuit and its nonlinear internal dynamics. The predicted generation rate is sufficiently high for experimental observation in circuit quantum electrodynamics, making this work a significant step toward the first experimental realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine in superconducting circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 ac...</summary><p>21 actual pages, 35 altogether. 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity near an Ising nematic quantum critical point in two dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08270v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Near a two-dimensional Ising-type nematic quantum critical point, the quantum fluctuations of the nematic order parameter are coupled to the electrons, leading to non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity. The interplay between these two effects has been extensively studied through the Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap. However, previous studies often rely on various approximations that may introduce uncertainties in the results. Here, we revisit this problem without these approximations and examine how their removal changes the outcomes. We numerically solve four self-consistent Eliashberg integral equations of the mass renormalization $A_{1}(p)$, the chemical potential renormalization $A_{2}(p)$, the pairing function $\Phi(p)$, and the nematic self-energy (polarization) function $\Pi(q)$ using the iteration method. Our calculations retain the explicit non-linearity and the full momentum dependence of these equations. We find that discarding some commonly used approximations allows for a more accurate determination of the superconducting gap $\Delta = \Phi/A_{1}$ and the critical temperature $T_{c}$. The Eliashberg equations have two different convergent gap solutions: an extended $s$-wave gap and a $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave gap. The latter is fragile, whereas the former is robust against small perturbations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A proposal for charge basis tomography of superconducting qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07748v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a general protocol for obtaining the charge basis density matrix of a superconducting quantum circuit. Inspired by cavity state tomography, our protocol combines Josephson-energy pulse sequences and projective charge-basis readout to access the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, a scheme we thus dub charge basis tomography. We simulate the reconstruction of the ground state of a target transmon using the Aharonov-Casher effect in a probe qubit to realise projective readout and show the Hilbert-Schmidt distance can detect deviations from the correct model Hamiltonian. Unlocking this ability to validate models using the ground state sets the stage for using transmons to detect interacting and topological phases, particularly in materials where time-domain and spectroscopic probes can be limited by intrinsic noise.</p></details> |  |

| **[Phases and critical transport of the SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10023v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study phases and transitions of a triangular Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field, called the Hofstadter-Hubbard model. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 4, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from self-consistent mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid (or stripe) states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U. We study the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid. The critical behavior serves as strong signatures of the critical theory and consequently of the existence of chiral spin liquid as the proximate phase.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09708v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model Induced by On-Site or Long-Range Two-Body Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09008v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a theoretical study of the dissipative dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model induced by on-site or long-range two-body losses. We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses. We finally investigate the dissipative quench dynamics starting from a strongly-correlated superfluid state or from a Mott-insulating state; for the Bose-Hubbard chain initially confined in the superfluid-correlated regime, an unexpected strong decay of the density appearing at short times is revealed.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |

We introduce the grand canonical and canonical free energy functionals for which we prove the existence of the minimizers. By analyzing their structure we show the existence of a superfluid phase at sufficiently low temperatures. In particular, we show that this model does not exhibit a quantum phase transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised and corrected version with a weaker statement in Theorem 2.2(4), 34 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases in a flat-top optical lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08104v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fermionic atoms in a large-scale, homogeneous optical lattice provide an ideal quantum simulator for investigating the fermionic Hubbard model, yet achieving this remains challenging. Here, by developing a hybrid potential that integrates a flat-top optical lattice with an optical box trap, we successfully realize the creation of three-dimensional, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases across approximately $8\times10^5$ lattice sites. This homogeneous system enables us to capture a well-defined energy band occupation that aligns perfectly with the theoretical calculations for a zero-temperature, ideal fermionic Hubbard model. Furthermore, by employing novel radio-frequency spectroscopy, we precisely measure the doublon fraction $D$ as a function of interaction strength $U$ and temperature $T$, respectively. The crossover from metal to Mott insulator is detected, where $D$ smoothly decreases with increasing $U$. More importantly, we observe a non-monotonic temperature dependence in $D$, revealing the Pomeranchuk effect and the development of extended antiferromagnetic correlations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directly imaging spin polarons in a kinetically frustrated Hubbard system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12951v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular lattice moir\'{e} materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (4 figures) + 8 pages methods (10 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Auxiliary dynamical mean-field approach for Anderson-Hubbard model with off-diagonal disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07353v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work reports a theoretical framework that combines the auxiliary coherent potential approximation (ACPA-DMFT) with dynamical mean-field theory to study strongly correlated and disordered electronic systems with both diagonal and off-diagonal disorders. In this method, by introducing an auxiliary coupling space with extended local degree of freedom,the diagonal and off-diagonal disorders are treated in a unified and self-consistent framework of coherent potential approximation, within which the dynamical mean-field theory is naturally combined to handle the strongly correlated Anderson-Hubbard model. By using this approach, we compute matsubara Green's functions for a simple cubic lattice at finite temperatures and derive impurity spectral functions through the maximum entropy method. Our results reveal the critical influence of off-diagonal disorder on Mott-type metal-insulator transitions. Specifically, a reentrant phenomenon is identified, where the system transitions between insulating and metallic states under varying interaction strengths. The ACPA-DMFT method provides an efficient and robust computational method for exploring the intricate interplay of disorder and strong correlations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Temperature Kinetic Ferromagnetism in the Square Lattice Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07252v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the exact phase diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model remains poorly understood despite decades of progress, nearly 60 years ago, Nagaoka proved that a single dopant in an otherwise half-filled Hubbard system can bring about ferromagnetism through kinetic means. The phenomenon was recently observed with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. Here, we explore the kinetic ferromagnetism within the square lattice Hubbard model and its strong-coupling counterpart, the $t-J$ model, at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit via numerical linked-cluster expansions. We find evidence of ferromagnetic Nagaoka polarons at dopings up to $\sim 30\%$ away from half filling for a variety of interaction strengths and at temperatures as low as $0.2$ of the hopping energy. We map out the boundaries of this phase through analyzing various correlation functions.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Observation of Magnon-Polarons in the Fermi-Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06757v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Programming optical-lattice Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05067v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fermionic atoms in optical lattices provide a native implementation of Fermi-Hubbard (FH) models that can be used as analog quantum simulators of many-body fermionic systems. Recent experimental advances include the time-dependent local control of chemical potentials and tunnelings, and thus enable to operate this platform digitally as a programmable quantum simulator. Here, we explore these opportunities and develop ground-state preparation algorithms for different fermionic models, based on the ability to implement both single-particle and many-body, high-fidelity fermionic gates, as provided by the native FH Hamiltonian. In particular, we first design variational, pre-compiled quantum circuits to prepare the ground state of the natively implemented FH model, with significant speedups relative to competing adiabatic protocols. Besides, the versatility of this variational approach enables to target extended FH models, i.e., including terms that are not natively realized on the platform. As an illustration, we include next-nearest-neighbor tunnelings at finite dopings, relevant in the context of $d$-wave superconductivity. Furthermore, we discuss how to approximate the imaginary-time evolution using variational fermionic circuits, both as an alternative state-preparation strategy, and as a subroutine for the Quantum Lanczos algorithm to further improve the energy estimation. We benchmark our protocols for ladder geometries, though they can be readily applied to 2D experimental setups to address regimes beyond the capabilities of current classical methods. These results pave the way for more efficient and comprehensive explorations of relevant many-body phases with existing programmable fermionic quantum simulators.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

Remarkably, the interaction induced bound state localization (BSL) can compete with non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and give rise to diverse density profiles. Via the quantum scattering methods in the center of mass frame, the system can be mapped to an effective two dimensional (2D) lattice with the two-particle interaction contributing to a defective line. For the bound states of the largest eigen-energy, in contrast to the Hermitian cases, where the maximal localization center is pinned around the center of lattice, NHSE can lead to a faded diagonal line localization. For the unbound scattering states, unlike the single corner localization in the 2D Hatano-Nelson model, interaction can force the total localization to split into multiple centers. To make the system topological nontrivial, we further include terms taking the form of two-photon tunneling and the non-Hermitian photon bound pairs are also observed, which demonstrates a competition among NHSE, BSL and edge localization. Finally, we propose the experimental simulations via the platforms of electrical circuits. Our works shed light on the crossover study of quantum optics and non-Hermitian many body physics.</p></details> |  |

Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide the first experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

Band structures, ferroelectric distortions, polarization, Born effective charges, and switching barriers are calculated with extended Hubbard functionals, that are compared with those using local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and Hybrid (HSE06) functionals. The properties of all three compounds calculated by extended Hubbard functionals are in good agreement with experimental data. We find a substantial increase in band gaps due to the inter-site Coulomb interactions, which show better agreement with $GW$ results compared to those from LDA and GGA functionals. The crucial role of the inter-site Coulomb interactions in restoring the suppressed polar instability, which is computed when only the on-site Hubbard interactions are considered, is also highlighted. Overall, we find that the properties calculated using our extended Hubbard functionals exhibit trends similar to those obtained with the HSE06 functional, while reducing computational costs by over an order of magnitude. Thus, we propose that the current method is well-suited for high-throughput calculations for perovskite oxides, offering significantly improved accuracy in computing band gap and other related physical properties such as the shift current photovoltaic effect and band alignments in ferroelectric heterostructures.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

This is a three-dimensional generalization of a similar mapping of the two-dimensional quantum Hall plateau transition to a one-dimensional Hubbard chain. We demonstrate that this mapping leads to the conclusion that the Weyl semimetal becomes a diffusive metal with a nonzero density of states at arbitrarily weak disorder, in agreement with recent work. We also discuss the absence of localization in strongly disordered Weyl semimetals from the viewpoint of this mapping.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+9 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Charge fluctuations, hydrodynamics and transport in the square-lattice Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04047v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling, we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the strong-coupling regimes.</p></details> | 27 pages, 23 figures |

It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U>0$ and $t>0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Machine learning Hubbard parameters with equivariant neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02457v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$) provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.</p></details> |  |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |

However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |
| **[Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

| **[Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

The VMC results are in good agreement with the exact diagonalization (ED) calculation. For the single-hole case, the degenerate ground states are characterized by quantum numbers of a spin-1/2 and an orbital angular momentum $L_z=\pm 2$. The latter is associated with the emergent chiral spin/hole currents mutually surrounding the hole/spin-1/2 as a composite object or ``twisted hole''. A vanishing quasiparticle spectral weight is shown in the large-sample limit. In the two-hole ground state, the holes form a spin-singlet pairing with $d$+$id$ symmetry in the Cooper channel, but are of $s$-wave symmetry as a tightly bound pair of the ``twisted holes''. Such a pairing mechanism of dichotomy can be attributed to eliminating the local spin currents which has nothing to do with the long-range antiferromagnetic correlation. Superconducting ground state at finite doping is briefly discussed in terms of the tightly bound hole pairs as the building blocks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and other multilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

We find significant hardening of optical Ni-O bond-stretching phonons when going from non-magnetic to paramagnetic state, and increasing Coulomb interaction will make them even harder. The electron correlation is found to be sensitive to the Ni-O bond-stretching distortions, indicating strong interplay between electron correlation and lattice. We find that the strong local electron correlation will not favor charge orders that couple to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons, in support of the recent experiment that a $3a_0$ charge order is absent in the infinite-layer nickelates. Our results emphasize that the effects of local magnetic fluctuations should be fully taken into account when describing the lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelates without long-range magnetic orders, and also provide evidence to ascribe the kink observed in the recent angle-resolved photoemission experiment to possible strong electron coupling to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Has b...</summary><p>Has been accepted for a publication in PRB</p></details> |

Here, we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistance, and Meissner effect in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with hydrostatic pressures up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase above 40 GPa. Zero resistance of the superconductivity was achieved with a maximum onset $T_c^{onset}$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa.

To gain deeper insights into the distinct superconducting states, it is essential to unravel the nature of the density-wave states at ambient pressure, a topic that remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the direct visualization of an incommensurate unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in real space. The density of states (DOS) is strongly depleted near $E_F$, indicating the opening of a CDW gap of $2{\Delta} \approx 71$ meV, which is unfavorable for the formation of superconductivity at ambient pressure. We propose that the CDW arises from Fermi surface nesting, and is likely a subsidiary phase of a spin density wave. Compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the weaker electronic correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is likely one reason for the lower $T_c$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved-photo-emission-spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants and is insensitive to the c-axis one. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket.

Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and the potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector ${Q}\approx(0,\pm0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From the view of the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to ${Q}_0\approx\pm(0.58\pi,0.58\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by Fermi surfaces nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ much lower than that under high pressure. Further more, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC at AP.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The calculation details are improved and the format is modified</p></details> |

However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is $d_{xy}$, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged. Our work highlights the sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on low-energy electronic structure in multi-orbital superconductors, which calls for care in the downfolding procedure when one calculates their pairing symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Absence of superconductivity and density-wave transition in ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12647v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure stimulates intensive research interests. These nickelates crystallize in an orthogonal/monoclinic structure with tilted NiO$_6$ octahedra at ambient pressure and enter a density-wave-like phase at low temperatures. The application of pressure suppresses the octahedral tilting and triggers a transition to tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), which is believed to be a key prerequisite for the emergence of superconducting state. Here, by developing a high oxidative environment growth technology, we report the first tetragonal nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ microcrystals without octahedral tilting at ambient pressure. In tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, transport measurements find that both density-wave and superconducting transitions are absent up to 160 GPa, indicating a robust tetragonal metallic ground state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the band structure of ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ involves more $d_{z2}$ orbital contribution to the Fermi surface, compared to the monoclinic phase or the high-pressure superconducting tetragonal phase. The concurrent absence of density-wave state and high-pressure superconductivity in our ambient-pressure tetragonal crystals of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ suggests an underlying correlation between these two orders. It suggests that the tetragonal structure is not necessary, while the density-wave state is crucial for the superconductivity in nickelates. Our findings impose important constraints on the mechanism of pressure-induced superconductivity in nickelates and sheds new light on exploring ambient pressure high-temperature Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | submitted |

In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to the unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetic ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest the formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ simultaneously, thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, supplemental material</p></details> |

Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of heterointerfaces between 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and SrLaAlO$_4$ substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced oxygen 2p hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest pathways for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</p></details> | under review |

In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By analyzing the geometric average of the local density of states, we identify an Anderson localization transition occurring around $\delta \sim 0.2$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures and Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 3 tables, 15 supplemental figures</p></details> |
| **[Competition of superconducting pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05254v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Various theoretical approaches have been applied to the study of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, but lead to a number of contradicting results. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and at the same time particularly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as changes of the electronic structure through pressure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. Our work paves the way to understanding seemingly contradictory theoretical results within a unified framework.</p></details> |  |

However, the precise crystal structure of the superconducting phase of the layered nickelates has not been fully clarified. Here, I use first principles calculations to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in the single-layer-trilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which is one member of the layered nickelates family that also shows signatures of superconductivity. I find a nearly dispersionless nondegenerate phonon branch in the parent $P4/mmm$ phase that is unstable along the Brillouin zone edge $M$ $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ $\rightarrow$ $A$ $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ at all investigated pressures up to 30 GPa. Calculations show additional doubly-degenerate instabilities along the edge $MA$ at lower pressures. I used group-theoretical analysis to identify the distinct low-symmetry distortions possible due to these instabilities and generated them using the eigenvectors of the unstable modes. Structural relaxations show that the lowest energy structures at 0 and 10 GPa involve condensation of both the nondegenerate and doubly-degenerate instabilities, which is in contrast to the experimental refinements that involve condensation of only the doubly-degenerate branch. I also find that structural distortions are energetically favorable at 20 GPa, contrary to the experiments that do not observe any distortions of the parent $P4/mmm$ structure at high pressures.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p></details> |  |

Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript just accepted in Nature Communications.

The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively.

Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</p></details> |  |

When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures (Published version)</p></details> |

In this work, we exploit the intense excitonic PL of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer combined with the high refractive index of bulk WS$_2$ to fabricate microdisk cavities with tunable light emission characteristics. These microdisks are created from a 50-nm-thick WS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure using frictional mechanical scanning probe lithography. The resulting cavities achieve a 4-10-fold enhancement in excitonic PL from the MoSe$_2$ monolayer at wavelengths near 800 nm. The excitonic PL peak is modulated by sharp spectral features, which correspond to whispering gallery modes (WGMs) supported by the cavity. A microdisk with a diameter of 2.35 $\mu$m demonstrates WGMs with a quality factor of up to 700, significantly surpassing theoretical predictions and suggesting strong potential for lasing applications. The spectral positions of the WGMs can be finely tuned by adjusting the microdisk's diameter and thickness, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. This approach offers a novel route for developing ultra-compact, all-TMDC double heterostructure light sources with record-small size.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures allow for tuning their electronic properties beyond their monolayer counterparts. We start by determining their electronic structure using density functional theory. We obtain the type-II band alignment and close in energy conduction band minima (valleys) at the $K$ and $Q$ points in the Brillouin zone. The valence band maxima, also energetically close, are located at the $K$ and $\Gamma$ points. By analyzing the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions, we describe the layer, spin, and orbital contributions. Next, we construct an \textit{ab initio}-based tight-binding model, which helps us to better understand the complexity of the interlayer interactions. We determine the effect of a vertical electric field, showing that vertical gating enables control of valleys extrema and their occupancy. Finally, we employ the tight-binding model to investigate laterally gated quantum dots and analyze the influence of a perpendicular electric field on their energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate that tuning the electric field enables control over the valley character of the quantum dot states, selectively localizing them in either the $K$ or $Q$ valleys, as evidenced by their characteristic degeneracies and wavefunctions.</p></details> |  |

In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporate the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir\'{e} unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferromagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Moreover, the hybridization of states from different layers and different valleys is allowed near the Fermi level. Those aspects are in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state.</p></details> |  |

Following earlier studies, this paper focuses on the hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer as a promising candidate for Li-decorated 2D materials. Our research reveals that lithium substitution on a selenium layer of MoSe2 can produce a hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer, which exhibits metallic behavior with potential phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.5 K. Additionally, by solving the anisotropic gap equations derived from Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we found that the Janus MoSeLi monolayer exhibits two-gap superconductivity. This finding underscores the potential of hexagonal Janus MoSeLi as a significant Li-decorated 2D material for exploring two-dimensional superconductivity and sets the stage for further investigations into new families of Janus transition-metal chalcogenides.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir\'e patterns of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H-stacking at a twist angle of 3.89$^{\circ}$ without spin-orbit coupling effect. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15$^{\circ}$. Multiple ultra-flat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7$^{\circ}$. The spin-orbit coupling leads to a giant spin splitting comparable to that observed in the untwisted system (about 0.45 eV) and is nearly independent of twisting and stacking. As a result, the K-valley flat band remains the valence band maximum with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Band unfolding reveals that the ultra-flat bands formed by the $\Gamma$ and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The $\Gamma$-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by structural reconstruction. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13$^{\circ}$) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</p></details> |  |

So far, it is assumed that the atomic reconstruction appearing in some of the heterostructures gives rise to a dominating localization of the exciton states. We demonstrate that excitonic states in reconstructed MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures can extend well beyond the moir\'e periodicity of the investigated heterostructures. The results are based on real-space calculations yielding a lateral potential map for interlayer excitons within the strain-relaxed heterostructures and corresponding real-space excitonic wavefunctions. We combine the theoretical results with cryogenic photoluminescence experiments, which support the computed level structure and relaxation characteristics of the interlayer excitons.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures based on transition-metal dichalcogenides have been extensively studied because of potential optoelectronic applications. We investigate the optical response of a light-emitting tunneling structure based on a WSe\textsubscript{2} monolayer as an active emission material using the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) experiments performed at low temperature of 5~K. We found that the application of the bias voltage allows us to change both a sign and a value of free carriers concentrations. Consequently, we address the several excitonic complexes emerging in PL spectra under applied bias voltage. The EL signal was also detected and ascribed to the emission in a high-carrier-concentration regime. The results show that the excitation mechanisms in the PL and EL are different, resulting in various emissions in both types of experimental techniques.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

The experimental findings reveal details of interlayer charge transfer on ultrafast timescales, showing that the spin-valley polarized state of photoexcited carriers is conserved during the charge transfer and formation of interlayer excitons. Our results confirm that phonon scattering mediates the interlayer charge transfer process, while a high phonon population at elevated temperatures causes a significant decrease in spin-valley selective charge transfer. Moreover, the experimental findings demonstrate the possibility that interlayer excitons and their spin-valley polarization can be probed in the optical response of intralayer excitons. These findings pave the way for ultrafast detection, control, and manipulation of spin-valley polarized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D heterostructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultrafast light-driven optical rotation and hidden orders in bulk WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06561v2)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-layer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, lacking point inversion symmetry, provide an efficient platform for valleytronics, where the electronic, magnetic, valley and lattice degrees of freedom can be selectively manipulated by using polarized light. This task is however thought to be limited in parent bulk compounds where the point inversion symmetry is restored. Exploiting the underlying quantum physics in bulk materials is thus one of the biggest paradigmatic challenges. Here we show that a sizable optical Kerr rotation can be efficiently generated in a wide energy range on ultrafast timescales in bulk WSe$_2$, by means of circularly-polarized light. We rationalize these findings as a result of the hidden spin/layer/valley quantum entanglement. The spectral analysis reveals clear features at the three characteristic frequencies corresponding to the A-, B- and C-exciton edges. The origin and the relative sign of all these features is shown to stem from the selective Pauli blocking of intralayer and interlayer optical transitions. The long lifetime of the broadband Kerr response ($\tau \sim 500$ fs) provides a strong indication that coupled photo-induced electron and hole densities survive in bulk compounds longer than previously expected. The present report demonstrates that a hidden quantum entanglement is operative also in bulk centrosymmetric layered materials, opening the way for an effective exploitation of bulk WSe$_2$ in optoelectronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+3 ...</summary><p>14+3 pages, 3+3 figures; fixed typo in the first author's name</p></details> |

In the equilibrium configuration, one of the O atoms is adsorbed on the vacancy and the other one atop one Se atom. Recombination of the CO molecule with the second of these O atoms to form CO$_2$ is a highly exothermic reaction, with an energy gain of around 3~eV. The likeliness of the CO oxidation reaction on this surface is next examined by calculating hundreds of AIMD trajectories for incidence energies that suffice to overcome the energy barriers in the entrance channel of the CO oxidative recombination. In spite of it, no CO$_2$ formation event is obtained. In most of the calculated trajectories the incoming CO molecule is directly reflected and in some cases, mainly at low energies, the molecules remain trapped at the surface but without reacting. As important conclusion, our AIMD simulations show that the recombination of CO molecules with adsorbed O atoms is a very unlikely reaction in this system, despite its large exothermicity.</p></details> |  |

The core idea of this method is to interpret the terms in the continuum model as a basis, allowing us to determine model parameters as coefficients of this basis through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We apply our method to twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ with twist angles ranging from 2.13$^\circ$ to 3.89$^\circ$, producing continuum models that exhibit excellent agreement with both energy bands and wavefunctions obtained from first-principles calculations. We further propose a strategy to integrate out the higher-energy degrees of freedom to reduce the number of the parameters in the model without sacrificing the accuracy for low-energy bands. Our findings reveal that decreasing twist angles typically need an increasing number of harmonics in the moir\'e potentials to accurately replicate first-principles results. We provide parameter values for all derived continuum models, facilitating further robust many-body calculations. Our approach is general and applicable to any commensurate moir\'e materials accessible by first-principles calculations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+47...</summary><p>14+47 pages, 5+8 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |

We first introduce the interacting model of RnG, which includes the noninteracting continuum model and the many-body Coulomb interaction. We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect in RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its appearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values. Our work establishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures. Comments are welcome</p></details> |

However, the non-Hermitian phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene remain unexplored. In this work, we study a non-Hermitian TBG formed by one-layer graphene twisted relative to another layer with gain and loss. Using a non-Hermitian generalization of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model, we find Dirac cones centered at only the $K_M$ ($K'_M$) corner of the moir\'e Brillouin zone at the $K'$ ($K$) valley deform into rings of exceptional points in the presence of non-Hermiticity, which is different from single-layer graphene with gain and loss, where exceptional rings appear in both $K$ and $K'$ corners of the Brillouin zone. We show that the exceptional rings are protected by non-Hermitian chiral symmetry. More interestingly, at an ``exceptional magic angle" larger than the Hermitian magic angle, the exceptional rings coincide and form non-Hermitian flat bands with zero energy and a finite lifetime. These non-Hermitian flat bands in the moir\'e system, which are isolated from dispersive bands, are distinguished from those in non-Hermitian frustrated lattices. In addition, we find that the non-Hermitian flat band has topological charge conserved in the moir\'e Brillouin zone, which is allowed for analogs of non-Hermitian fractional quantum Hall states.</p></details> | <details><summary>final...</summary><p>final version,9 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Variational Scarring in Graphene Quantum Dots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13157v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system is referred as scarred by an unstable periodic orbit if its probability density is concentrated in the vicinity of that orbit. Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heavy Fermions as an Efficient Representation of Atomistic Strain and Relaxation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13880v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the strongly interacting flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have been approached using the minimal Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) Hamiltonian, there is mounting evidence that strain and lattice relaxation are essential in correctly determining the order of the correlated insulator groundstates. These effects can be incorporated in an enhanced continuum model by introducing additional terms computed from the relaxation profile. To develop an analytical and physical understanding of these effects, we include strain and relaxation in the topological heavy fermion (HF) model of TBG. We find that strain and relaxation are very well captured in first order perturbation theory by projection onto the fully symmetric HF Hilbert space, and remarkably do not alter the interacting terms in the periodic Anderson model. Their effects are fully incorporated in the single-particle HF Hamiltonian, and can be reproduced in a minimal model with only 4 symmetry-breaking terms. Our results demonstrate that the heavy fermion framework of TBG is an efficient and robust representation of the perturbations encountered in experiment.</p></details> |  |

SAWs interact with adjacent materials through piezoelectric and strain fields, dragging carriers in the direction of wave propagation. Most studies on the acoustoelectric effect have focused on the collective directional motion of carriers, which generates a steady electric potential difference, while the oscillating component from dynamic spatial charge modulation has remained challenging to probe. In this work, we report the coherent detection of oscillating acoustoelectric effect in graphene. This is achieved through the coherent rectification of spatial-temporal charge oscillation with electromagnetic waves emitted by interdigital transducers. We systematically investigate the frequency and gate dependence of rectified signals and quantitatively probe the carrier redistribution dynamics driven by SAWs. The observation of oscillating acoustoelectric effect provides direct access to the dynamic spatial charge modulation induced by SAWs through transport experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, to appear in PRL</p></details> |

For the time harmonic potential with moderate to high alpha (=amplitude/frequency) the central Floquet band is found to be almost cloaked for the Klein transmitted electron in contrast to electron at higher grazing incidences. As a time periodic drive, we mainly focused on the use of rectangular wave electric signal to modulate the transparency of the barrier. It is noted that the asymmetric Fano resonance, a characteristic feature of photon assisted tunneling, is more likely to occur for rectangular drive in contrast to the harmonic one. The height of the modulating potential is particularly responsible for the dressing effect of the barrier. The position and nature of the FR can be tailored by changing the height and frequency of the rectangular drive. Moreover, the duty cycle of the driving potential turns out to be an important controlling parameter for the transmission process. Thus, the rectangular modulation plays an important role for the occurrence and detection of the Fano resonances which is vital for the use of graphene nanostructure in the field of detectors, sensors, modulators etc. The present findings attempt for the first time, to realize the effect of duty cycle on the quantum interference in semiconductor nanostructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages with 5 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we obtain higher-order corrections to the Bistritzer-MacDonald model via a systematic multiple-scales expansion. We prove that the solution of the resulting higher-order PDE model accurately approximates the corresponding tight-binding wave function under a natural choice of parameters and given initial conditions that are spectrally localized to the monolayer Dirac points. Numerical simulations of tight-binding and continuum dynamics demonstrate the validity of the higher-order continuum model. Symmetries of the higher-order models are also discussed. This work extends the analysis from \cite{watson2023bistritzer}, which rigorously established the validity of the (first-order) BM model.</p></details> |  |

While moir\'e systems provide a powerful method to realize this spectrum, previous experiments, however, have been limited to fractional flux quanta regime due to the difficulty of building ~ 50 nm periodic modulations. Here, we demonstrate a super-moir\'e strategy to overcome this challenge. By aligning monolayer graphene (G) with 1.0{\deg} twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN), a 63.2 nm bichromatic G/t-hBN super-moir\'e is constructed, made possible by exploiting the electrostatic nature of t-hBN potential. Under magnetic field B, magnetic Bloch states at integer flux quanta (1-9) are achieved and observed as integer Brown-Zak oscillations, expanding the flux quanta from factions to integers. Theoretical analysis reproduces these experimental findings. This work opens new avenues to study unexplored Hofstadter butterfly, explore emergent topological order at integer flux quanta and engineer long-wavelength periodic modulations.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

However, their fabrication process often introduces moir\'e disorders, hindering reproducibility and experimental control. Here, we propose an alternative approach using gradient strain to construct moir\'e superlattices in untwisted bilayer graphene (gs-BLG). Through force-field and first-principles calculations, we show that gs-BLG exhibits kagome-like interlayer-spacing distributions and strain-tunable kagome electronic bands. The competition between interlayer coupling and in-plane strain relaxation leads to distinct structural deformations, giving rise to three forms of diatomic kagome lattices: subtle, pronounced, and distorted. Kagome electronic bands are identified near the Fermi level in their band structures. Modulating strain gradients enables tailoring bandwidths and signs of hopping parameters of these kagome bands, providing a versatile platform for studying exotic electronic phases. Our findings establish gradient strain as an alternative to twist engineering, opening an avenue for exploring emergent electronic phases in graphene-based systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Spin-Valley Protected Kramers Pair in Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08143v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intrinsic valley degree of freedom makes bilayer graphene (BLG) a unique platform for semiconductor qubits. The single-carrier quantum dot (QD) ground state exhibits a two-fold degeneracy, where the two states that constitute a Kramers pair, have opposite spin and valley quantum numbers. Because of the valley-dependent Berry curvature, an out-of-plane magnetic field breaks the time-reversal symmetry of this ground state and a qubit can be encoded in the spin-valley subspace. The Kramers states are protected against known spin- and valley-mixing mechanisms because mixing requires a simultaneous change of both quantum numbers. Here, we fabricate a tunable QD device in Bernal BLG and measure a spin-valley relaxation time for the Kramers states of ${38~\mathrm{s}}$, which is two orders of magnitude longer than the ${0.4~\mathrm{s}}$ measured for purely spin-blocked states. We also show that the intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit splitting enables a Kramers doublet single-shot readout even at zero magnetic field with a fidelity above ${99\%}$. If these long-lived Kramers states also possess long coherence times and can be effectively manipulated, electrostatically defined QDs in BLG may serve as long-lived semiconductor qubits, extending beyond the spin qubit paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary Information is included in the .pdf</p></details> |
| **[Imaging van Hove Singularity Heterogeneity in Overdoped Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07899v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tuning the chemical potential of a solid to the vicinity of a van Hove singularity (vHS) is a well-established route to discovering emergent quantum phases. In monolayer graphene, the use of electron-donating metal layers has recently emerged as a method to dope the chemical potential to the nearest vHS, as evidenced by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. In this work, we study the spatial uniformity of the doping from this process using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM). Using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we achieve electron doping of graphene on SiC using Ytterbium (Yb-Graphene). We show using in-situ ARPES that the chemical potential is shifted to within 250 meV of the vHS. Using in-situ SI-STM, we establish that there exists significant inhomogeneity in the vHS position in overdoped graphene. We find two separate reasons for this. First, the spatial inhomogeneity of the intercalated Yb leads to local variations in the doping, with a length scale of inhomogeneity set by the screening length of ~ 3 nm. Second, we observe the presence of substitutional Yb dopants in the graphene basal plane. These Yb dopants cause a strong local shift of the doping, along with a renormalization of the quasiparticle amplitude. Theoretical calculations confirm that the Yb impurities effectively change the local potential, thus energetically shifting the position of the van Hove singularity. Our results point to the importance of considering the spatial structure of doping and its inextricable link to electronic structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16032v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Typos...</summary><p>Typos corrected; reference added</p></details> |

By contrast, in bilayer graphene the valley degree of freedom, stemming from the crystal lattice symmetry, is a robust quantum number that can therefore be harnessed for this purpose. The simplest implementation of a valley qubit would rely on two states with opposite valleys as in the case of a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot immersed in a small perpendicular magnetic field ($B_\perp\lesssim 100$mT). However, the single-carrier quantum dot excited states spectrum has not been resolved to date in the relevant magnetic field range. Here, we fill this gap, by measuring the parallel and perpendicular magnetic field dependence of this spectrum with an unprecedented resolution of $4\mu$eV. We use a time-resolved charge detection technique that gives us access to individual tunnel events. Our results come as a direct verification of the predicted spectrum and establish a new upper-bound on inter-valley mixing, equal to our energy resolution. Our charge detection technique opens the door to measuring the relaxation time of a valley qubit in a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot.</p></details> |  |

Using a semiclassical approach, we solve Maxwell's equations within the cavity, approximating the optical conductivity of bilayer graphene through its excitonic response as described by the Elliott formula. Transitioning to a quantum mechanical framework, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian governing excitons and cavity photons, revealing the resulting polariton dispersions, Hopfield coefficients and Rabi splittings. Our analysis predicts that, under realistic exciton lifetimes, the exciton-photon interaction reaches the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we explore the integration of an epsilon-near-zero material within the cavity, demonstrating that such a configuration can further enhance the light-matter interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, PRB Editor's suggestion</p></details> |

Even denominator FQH states (FQHSs) at half-filling are particularly interesting as they are predicted to host non-Abelian excitations with non-trivial braiding statistics. Such states are predominantly observed in the $N=1$ Landau level (LL) of semiconductors such as GaAs. In this Letter, we report the unanticipated observation of even-denominator FQHSs in the $N=0$ LL of ABA trilayer graphene (TLG), a system characterized by tunable LL mixing and the absence of inversion symmetry. Notably, we find robust FQHSs at $\nu=5/2$ and $\nu=7/2$ when two LLs, originating from a monolayer-like band of TLG with different isospin indices, cross each other. These are flanked by the Levin-Halperin daughter states at $\nu=7/13$ and $\nu=9/17$, respectively, and further away, the standard series of Jain-sequence of composite fermions (CFs) is observed. The even-denominator FQHSs and their accompanying daughter states become stronger with increasing magnetic fields, while concomitantly, a weakening of the CF states is observed. We posit that the absence of inversion symmetry in the system gives rise to additional isospin interactions, which enhance LL mixing and soften the short-range part of the Coulomb repulsion, stabilizing the even-denominator FQHSs. In addition, we demonstrate that these states, along with their daughter states, can be finely tuned with an external displacement field that serves as an important tool to control the LL mixing in the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, comments and suggestions are very welcome</p></details> |

The demand for innovative techniques to enable the exploration and precise manipulation of graphene-like nanoribbons.

The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (< 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, fabricating such devices is challenging due to the difficulty in achieving and maintaining homogeneous twist-angles. Here, we present a fabrication method to preserve the twist-angle with minimal deformation. We fabricated marginally twisted double-bilayer graphene (mTDBG) stacks and directly imaged the resulting triangular superlattice periodicity via scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). This technique enabled us to monitor twist-angle deformation at each fabrication step, paving the way for more reliable device fabrication and facilitating the exploration of twist-angle-dependent physics.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

This response is analyzed using a four-band Hamiltonian derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations. For the laser-stimulated dynamics, we employ structure gauge-invariant evolutionary equations to accurately describe the evolution of the single-particle density matrix across the entire Brillouin zone. The resonant generation of electron-hole pairs by the high-frequency component of the field, combined with the induction of high-order harmonic generation and high-order wave mixing by the strong low-frequency field component, leads to significant alterations in the resulting spectra. These changes are driven by the effects of Berry curvature and the shift vector, which modify the relative contributions of interband and intraband channels, thereby fundamentally reshaping the radiation spectra at high-order frequency multiplication. The numerical results are further supported by approximate analytical calculations, demonstrating that high-order wave mixing can be modeled using the classical trajectory analysis of electron-hole pairs, with Berry curvature and the shift vector significantly influencing the saddle-point equations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persistent Haldane Phase in Carbon Tetris Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08252v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of tetris chains, which are linear arrays of 4-site molecules that differ by their intermolecular hopping geometry. We investigate the fermionic symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase in these systems using Hubbard-type models. The topological phase diagrams can be understood via different competing limits and mechanisms: strong-coupling $U\gg t$, weak-coupling $U\ll t$, and the weak intermolecular hopping limit $t'\ll t$. Our particular focus is on two tetris chains that are of experimental relevance. First, we show that a Y-chain of coarse-grained nanographene molecules (triangulenes) is robustly in the Haldane phase in the whole $t'-U$ plane due to the cooperative nature of the three limits. Secondly, we study a near-homogeneous Y$^{\prime}$-chain that is closely related to the electronic model for poly(p-phenylene vinylene). In the latter case, the above mechanisms compete, but the Haldane phase manifests robustly and is stable when long-ranged Pariser-Parr-Popple interactions are added. The site-edged Hubbard ladder can also be viewed as a tetris chain, which gives a very general perspective on the emergence of its fermionic Haldane phase. Our numerical results are obtained by large-scale, SU(2)-symmetric tensor network calculations. We employ the density-matrix-renormalization group as well as the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) algorithms for finite and infinite systems, respectively. The numerics are supplemented by analytical calculations of the bandstructure winding number.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-stabilizerness of Neural Quantum States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09725v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a methodology to estimate non-stabilizerness or "magic", a key resource for quantum complexity, with Neural Quantum States (NQS). Our framework relies on two schemes based on Monte Carlo sampling to quantify non-stabilizerness via Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) in arbitrary variational wave functions. When combined with NQS, this approach is effective for systems with strong correlations and in dimensions larger than one, unlike Tensor Network methods. Firstly, we study the magic content in an ensemble of random NQS, demonstrating that neural network parametrizations of the wave function capture finite non-stabilizerness besides large entanglement. Secondly, we investigate the non-stabilizerness in the ground state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. In 1D, we find that the SRE vanishes at the Majumdar-Ghosh point $J_2 = J_1/2$, consistent with a stabilizer ground state. In 2D, a dip in the SRE is observed near maximum frustration around $J_2/J_1 \approx 0.6$, suggesting a Valence Bond Solid between the two antiferromagnetic phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 + 5...</summary><p>6 + 5 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses. We finally investigate the dissipative quench dynamics starting from a strongly-correlated superfluid state or from a Mott-insulating state; for the Bose-Hubbard chain initially confined in the superfluid-correlated regime, an unexpected strong decay of the density appearing at short times is revealed.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267v4)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures. v2: minor edits. v3: stronger statement regarding ruling out possibilities of quantum advantage. v4: edited discussion</p></details> |

In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Tree Tensor Networks for quantum simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05784v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid Tensor Networks (hTN) offer a promising solution for encoding variational quantum states beyond the capabilities of efficient classical methods or noisy quantum computers alone. However, their practical usefulness and many operational aspects of hTN-based algorithms, like the optimization of hTNs, the generalization of standard contraction rules to an hybrid setting, and the design of application-oriented architectures have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm to perform ground state optimizations with hybrid Tree Tensor Networks (hTTNs), discussing its advantages and roadblocks, and identifying a set of promising applications. We benchmark our approach on two paradigmatic models, namely the Ising model at the critical point and the Toric code Hamiltonian. In both cases, we successfully demonstrate that hTTNs can improve upon classical equivalents with equal bond dimension in the classical part.</p></details> | 21 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Quantum Supercritical Crossover with Dynamical Singularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05455v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supercritical states, characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena, emerge above the critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercriticality from classical to quantum systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is revealed, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is a critical exponent. Moreover, we uncover the QSC crossover line defines a boundary for the dynamical singularity to appear in quench dynamics, which can be ascribed to the intersection between the Lee-Yang zero line and the real-time axis. In particular, when the Hamiltonian parameter is quenched to the QSC crossover line, a singular cusp with exponent 1/2 emerge in the Loschmidt rate function, signaling a new dynamical universality class different from the linear cusp for $h=0$. Possible platforms, such as quantum simulators and quantum magnets are proposed for studying QSC crossovers in experiments. Our work paves the way for exploring QSC crossovers in and out of equilibrium in quantum many-body systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+2+2...</summary><p>8+2+2 pages, 5+3+2 figures</p></details> |

We present a method to obtain an equation that solves exactly any combinatorial problem, both inversion, constraint satisfaction and optimization, by obtaining its equivalent tensor network. This formulation only requires a basic knowledge of classical logical operators, at a first year level of any computer science degree. These equations are not necessarily computable in a reasonable time, nor do they allow to surpass the state of the art in computational complexity, but they allow to have a new perspective for the mathematical analysis of these problems. These equations computation can be approximated by different methods such as Matrix Product State compression. We also present the equations for numerous combinatorial problems. This work proves that, if there is a physical system capable of contracting in polynomial time the tensor networks presented, every NP-Hard problem can be solved in polynomial time.</p></details> | 66 pages, 45 figures |
| **[Qubit Regurlarization of Quantum Field Theories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05716v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, plenary talk presented at the 41st International Symposium on Lattice Field theory (LATTICE2024), July 28th - August 3rd, 2024, Liverpool, UK</p></details> |

This review explores the landscape of photonic quantum simulation, focusing on the transition from Gaussian to non-Gaussian models and the computational challenges associated with simulating large-scale photonic systems. Gaussian states and operations, which enable efficient simulations through covariance matrices and phase-space representations, serve as the foundation for photonic quantum computing. However, non-Gaussian states crucial for universal quantum computation introduce significant computational complexity, requiring advanced numerical techniques such as tensor networks and high-performance GPU acceleration. We evaluate the leading photonic quantum simulators, including Strawberry Fields, Piquasso, QuTiP SimulaQron, Perceval, and QuantumOPtics.jl analyzing their capabilities in handling continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum systems. Special attention is given to hardware-accelerated methods, including GPU-based tensor network approaches, machine learning integration, and hybrid quantum-classical workflows. Furthermore, we investigate noise modeling techniques, such as photon loss and dark counts, and their impact on simulation accuracy. As photonic quantum computing moves toward practical implementations, advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) architectures, such as tensor processing units (TPUs) and system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions, are accelerating the field. This review highlights emerging trends, challenges, and future directions for developing scalable and efficient photonic quantum simulators.</p></details> |  |

Tensor networks (TNs) have gained prominence in recent years in modeling classical systems with quantum-inspired approaches. More recently, TN generative-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) has been proposed as a strategy which uses generative modeling to efficiently sample valid solutions with respect to certain constraints of optimization problems. Moreover, it has been shown that symmetric TNs (STNs) can encode certain constraints of optimization problems, thus aiding in their solution process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of TN- and STN-GEO to an industry relevant problem class, a multi-knapsack problem, in which each object must be assigned to an available knapsack. We detail a prescription for practitioners to use the TN-and STN-GEO methodology and study its scaling behavior and dependence on its hyper-parameters. We benchmark 60 different problem instances and find that TN-GEO and STN-GEO produce results of similar quality to simulated annealing.</p></details> |  |

We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space.

Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results.

We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms.

However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction.

In contrast, most scientific and industry classical computation workloads happen in parallel on distributed systems, which rely on copying data across multiple cores. Unfortunately, copying quantum data is theoretically prohibited due to the quantum non-cloning theory. Instead, quantum circuit cutting techniques cut a large quantum circuit into multiple smaller subcircuits, distribute the subcircuits on parallel QPUs and reconstruct the results with classical computing. Such techniques make distributed hybrid quantum computing (DHQC) a possibility but also introduce an exponential classical co-processing cost in the number of cuts and easily become intractable. This paper presents TensorQC, which leverages classical tensor networks to bring an exponential runtime advantage over state-of-the-art parallelization post-processing techniques. As a result, this paper demonstrates running benchmarks that are otherwise intractable for a standalone QPU and prior circuit cutting techniques. Specifically, this paper runs six realistic benchmarks using QPUs available nowadays and a single GPU, and reduces the QPU size and quality requirements by more than $10\times$ over purely quantum platforms.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

Although many advanced approaches have been proposed and recently used to challenge quantum advantage experiments, novel efficient methods for the approximate simulation of complex quantum systems are still in high demand. Here we propose a scalable technique for approximate simulations of intermediate-size quantum circuits on the basis of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and Riemannian optimization. The MERA is a tensor network, whose geometry together with orthogonality constraints imposed on its tensors allow approximating many-body quantum states lying beyond the area-law scaling of the entanglement entropy. We benchmark the proposed technique for brick-wall quantum circuits of up to 243 qubits with various depths up to 20 layers.

From short- and intermediate-time dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the associated values of the critical exponent. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite temperature fermion Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated spin-Peierls systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06565v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Abrikosov fermion representation of the spin-1/2 degree of freedom allows for auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated spin systems. This approach provides a manifold of equivalent actions over which the negative sign problem can be optimised. As a result, we can reach temperature scales well below the magnetic scale. Here, we show how to generalise this algorithm to spin-Peierls systems. In contrast to exact diagonalisation approaches, Monte Carlo methods are not Hilbert space bound such that the computational effort per sweep remains invariant when adding phonons. However, the computational effort required to generate independent configurations increases in the presence of phonons. We also show that, for the specific case of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, the inclusion of phonons does not render the negative sign problem more severe. This new algorithm hence allows us to investigate the interplay between phonon degrees of freedom and magnetic frustration. We present results for frustrated and non-frustrated spin systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, article</p></details> |
| **[Sampling Electronic Fock States using Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18246v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analog quantum simulation based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the study of quantum many-body systems. These simulations rely on the statistical sampling of electronic Fock states, which are not easily accessible in classical algorithms. In this work, we modify the determinant quantum Monte Carlo by integrating a Fock-state update mechanism alongside the auxiliary field. This method enables efficient sampling of Fock-state configurations. The Fock-state restrictive sampling scheme further enables the pre-selection of multiple ensembles at no additional computational cost, thereby broadening the scope of simulation to more general systems and models. Employing this method, we analyze static correlations of the Hubbard model up to the fourth order and achieve quantitative agreement with cold-atom experiments. The simulations of dynamical spectroscopies of the Hubbard and Kondo-lattice models further demonstrate the reliability and advantage of this method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Non-linear Quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05094v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mean of a random variable can be understood as a $\textit{linear}$ functional on the space of probability distributions. Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating $\textit{non-linear}$ functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al.. The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors. A key innovation of our approach is a new sequence of multilevel Monte Carlo approximations specifically designed for quantum computing, which is central to the algorithm's improved performance.</p></details> | 30 pages |

While scaling corrections have been shown to play important roles in fully characterizing equilibrium quantum criticality, their impact on nonequilibrium critical dynamics has not been extensively explored. In this work, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in a two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model. We find that in this model the scaling corrections arising from both finite system size and finite driving rate must be incorporated into the finite-time scaling form in order to properly describe the nonequilibrium scaling behaviors. In addition, improved scaling relations are obtained from the expansion of the full scaling form. We numerically verify these scaling forms and improved scaling relations for different starting states using the nonequilibrium quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Correlation Effects in a Simplified Bilayer Two-Orbital Hubbard Model at Half Filling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12042v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01264v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Quantum State Study of Fracton Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11677v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 21 figures, (Re-)Submission to SciPost Added X-cube simulations, extended Figure 9 (and additional Figure 20), added references</p></details> |
| **[Particle-wave dichotomy in quantum Monte Carlo: unlocking the quantum correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03298v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here, a dichotomy of particles and waves is employed in a quantum Monte Carlo calculation of interacting electrons. Through the creation and propagation of concurrent stochastic ensembles of walkers in physical space and in Hilbert space one can correctly predict the ground state and the real-time evolution of a single electron interacting with larger quantum system. It is shown that such walker ensembles can be constructed straightforwardly through a stochastic sampling (windowing) applied to the mean-field approximation. Our calculations reveal that the ground state and the real-time evolution of the probability distributions and the decoherence due to the Coulomb interaction in presence of strong ultrashort laser pulse can be accounted for correctly by calculating the density matrix of the electron, without referencing to the quantum many-body state of the whole system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+9 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Charge fluctuations, hydrodynamics and transport in the square-lattice Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04047v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling, we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the strong-coupling regimes.</p></details> | 27 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18937v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave functions in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Efficient calculation of trion energies in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09376v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reduced dielectric screening in atomically thin semiconductors leads to remarkably strong electron interactions. As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schr\"odinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges) via the Land\'e subtraction method. Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Local Basis Transformation to Mitigate Negative Sign Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18069v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for the frustrated quantum spin systems occasionally suffer from the negative sign problem, which makes simulations exponentially harder for larger systems at lower temperatures and severely limits QMC's application across a wide range of spin systems. This problem is known to depend on the choice of representation basis. We propose a systematic approach for mitigating the sign problem independent of the given Hamiltonian or lattice structure. We first introduce the concept of negativity to characterize the severity of the negative sign problem. We then demonstrate the existence of a locally defined quantity, the L1 adaptive loss function, which effectively approximates negativity, especially in frustration-free systems. Using the proposed loss function, we demonstrate that optimizing the representation basis can mitigate the negative sign. This is evidenced by several frustration-free models and other important quantum spin systems. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unitary transformations against the standard orthogonal transformation and reveal that unitary transformations can effectively mitigate the sign problem in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures.

This method consistently provides more accurate energy estimates than coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), often regarded as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. This level of precision is achieved at a lower asymptotic computational cost, scaling as $O(N^6)$ compared to the $O(N^7)$ scaling of CCSD(T). We provide numerical evidence supporting these findings through results for challenging main group and transition metal-containing molecules.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15428v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</p></details> |  |

The recently devised time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method allows a self-consistent treatment of the system of particles together with bath oscillators first for imaginary-time propagation of Schroedinger type of equations where both the system and the bath converge to their finite temperature ground state, and next for real time calculation where the dissipative dynamics is demonstrated. In that context the application of TDQMC appears as promising alternative to the path-integral related techniques where the real time propagation can be a challenge.</p></details> |  |

By solving concurrently sets of up to 20 000 coupled 3D time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the guide waves and corresponding sets of first order equations of motion for the Monte Carlo walkers we obtain ground state energies in close agreement with the exact values. The combined use of spherical coordinates and B-splines along the radial coordinate proves to be especially accurate and efficient for such calculations. Our results for the dipole response and the ionization of an atom with un-correlated electrons are in good agreement with the predictions of the conventional time-dependent Hartree-Fock method while the calculations with correlated electrons show enhanced ionization that is due to the electron-electron repulsion.</p></details> |  |

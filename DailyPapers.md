| **[Gate modulation and interface engineering on Coulomb blockade in open superconducting islands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07593v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mesoscopic Coulomb blockade (MCB) is recognized as a phase-coherent variant of the conventional Coulomb blockade that arises in systems with open contacts. In open quantum dots, MCB is enhanced by a decrease in background conductance. This occurs because the reduction in coupling strength between the quantum dot and the outer reservoir renders the system more closed, thereby facilitating the emergence of conventional Coulomb blockade. In this work, we demonstrate that the MCB in open superconducting islands exhibits an different correlation with coupling strength compared to open quantum dots. Specifically, a decrease in background conductance may result in a weakening of the MCB. This observation indicates that the MCB in superconducting islands originates from the presence of superconducting-normal interfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Majorana edge modes in one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07436v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new type of one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing. We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to the rich phase diagram. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Variational Quantum Monte Carlo investigations of the superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07341v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the pairing symmetry in the novel superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure by the non-perturbative variational quantum Monte Carlo. Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04159v4)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experiments, confirming that the synchronized temperature ramp-down can fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized temperature ramp-down can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we explore the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the temperature ramp-down can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution. The findings not only provide a robust method for stabilizing various superconducting magnet systems, including high-temperature superconducting magnets wound with second-generated (2G) coated tapes, but also suggest a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in other nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Dome and Quantum Criticality in Two-Dimensional NbO2 Triangular Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07241v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of superconductivity with strong correlation is one of the most attracted issues in condensed-matter physics, as seen in various unconventional superconductors. Here we show a new strongly correlated superconductor Li1-xNbO2 with rich characteristics such as two-dimensional, geometrically frustrated, and triangular NbO2 lattice and correlated flat-band-like electronic states. We revealed the electronic phase diagram by implementing Li-ion electrochemical cells with LiNbO2 epitaxial films. The Li-ion deintercalation increased the hole-doping level in NbO2 layer, along which a band insulator LiNbO2 underwent to a Fermi-liquid (FL) metal and superconductor associated with non-Fermi liquid (NFL) characters. The evolution of the NFL state coincided with the suppression of the Kondo-singlet formation near the superconducting dome, which linked superconductivity with quantum criticality. The obtained phase diagram involves general aspects of strongly correlated superconductors and bridges the gap between various systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Stabilization of the skyrmion in a hybrid magnetic-superconducting nanostucture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07133v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stabilization of skyrmions in a magnetic material without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction requires using of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, such as a demagnetization field or an Oersted field. To control and tune the local magnetic field in magnetic material we propose to exploit superconducting nanorings. The field stabilizes the skyrmion through the presence of persistent current induced by the pulses of external field. We analyze the conditions for the stabilization of Neel skyrmion in ferromagnetic layers with out-of-plane anisotropy, as a function of the nanoring size and induced superconducting current. We show that the superconducting current should exceed a critical value for the skyrmion to become stable. The paper presents consistent results from both analytical and micromagnetic calculations for Co and Ga:YIG thin magnetic films.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Theoretical study on the possibility of high $T_c$ s$\pm$-wave superconductivity in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21461v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Out-of-plane bond-order phase, superconductivity, and their competition in the $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model: Possible implications for bilayer nickelates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00269v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Almost four decades of intense research have been invested to study the physics of high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. The recent discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelates and its potential similarities with cuprate superconductors may open a new window to understand this long-standing problem. We have studied the proposed bilayer $t$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model [where $J_\parallel$ ($J_\perp$) is the in-plane (out-of-plane) magnetic exchange] in a large-$N$ approach on the basis of the path integral representation for Hubbard operators, which allows to obtain results at mean-field and beyond mean-field level. We find that $J_\perp$ is a candidate for triggering high superconducting $T_c$ values at quarter filling (hole doping $\delta=0.5$) of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Beyond mean-field level, we find a new phase, an out-of-plane bond-order phase (z-BOP), triggered also by $J_\perp$. z-BOP develops below a critical temperature which decreases with increasing doping and vanishes at a quantum critical point below quarter filling. The occurrence of this phase and its competition with superconductivity leads to a superconducting dome-shaped behavior as a function of doping and as a function of $J_\perp$. Qualitative comparisons with the physics of cuprates and the recent literature on the new pressurized nickelates are given along the paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages (main text) + 8 pages (references + appendices), 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interface-Bound States and Majorana Zero Modes in Lateral Heterostructures of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with Proximity-Induced Superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06644v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive investigation into the emergence of interface-bound states, particularly Majorana zero modes (MZMs), in a lateral heterostructure composed of two three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, under the influence of proximity-induced superconductivity from niobium (Nb) contacts. We develop an advanced two-dimensional Dirac model for the topological surface states (TSS), incorporating spatially varying chemical potentials and s-wave superconducting pairing. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism, we derive analytical solutions for the bound states and compute the local density of states (LDOS) at the interface, revealing zero-energy modes characteristic of MZMs. The topological nature of these states is rigorously analyzed through winding numbers and Pfaffian invariants, and their robustness is explored under various physical perturbations, including gating effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this heterostructure as a platform for topological quantum computing, with detailed predictions for experimental signatures via tunneling spectroscopy.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Tunneling Spectroscopy in Superconducting Circuit Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07997v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate tunneling spectroscopy of synthetic quantum matter in superconducting circuit lattices. We measure site-resolved excitation spectra by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative particle baths that serve as local tunneling probes. Using incoherent particle source and drain, we independently extract quasi-particle and quasi-hole spectra and reconstruct the spatial structure of collective excitations. We perform spectroscopy of a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different densities, observing changes in energy gaps across the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition and the effects of three-body interactions. Our results provide a new toolset for characterizing many-body states in analog quantum simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text (9 pages, 4 figures) and Supplemental Material (4 pages, 1 table, 2 figures).

| **[Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-Pérot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15058v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Non-degenerate pumping of superconducting resonator parametric amplifier with evidence of phase-sensitive amplification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06155v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers are potentially important components for a wide variety of fundamental physics experiments and utilitarian applications. We propose and realise an operation scheme that achieves amplification through the use of non-degenerate pumps, which addresses two key challenges in the design of parametric amplifiers: non-continuous gain across the band over which amplification is possible, and pump-tone removal. We have experimentally demonstrated the non-degenerate pumping scheme using a half-wave resonator amplifier based on NbN thin-film, and measured peak gain of 26 dB and 3-dB bandwidth of 0.5 MHz. The two non-degenerate pump tones were positioned ~10 bandwidths above and below the frequency at which peak gain occurs. We have found the non-degenerate pumping scheme to be more stable compared to the usual degenerate pumping scheme in terms of gain drift against time, by a factor of 4. This scheme also retains the usual flexibility of NbN resonator parametric amplifiers in terms of reliable amplification in a ~4 K environment, and is suitable for cross-harmonic amplification. The use of pump at different frequencies allows phase-sensitive amplification when the signal tone is degenerate with the idler tone. A gain of 23 dB and squeezing ratio of 6 dB have been measured.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Exactly Solvable Model of Phase-Fluctuating Superconductivity in Cuprates: The Role of Partially Flat Bands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05761v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing an exactly solvable Hubbard-like model that exhibits a pseudogap (PG) phase and a partially flat band, we perform self-consistent microscopic calculations of the superconductivity (SC) in cuprates, incorporating both thermal and zero-point superconducting phase fluctuations in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. The results reveal an important role of the partially flat band in determining phase-fluctuating SC as well as several key features that are consistent with experimental observations. Specifically, we find a dome-shaped $d$-wave superconducting region in the temperature-doping phase diagram with the optimal doping point located near the quantum critical point between the PG and the metallic phases. Near the optimal doping, the partially flat band suppresses and amplifies the fluctuation-induced destructing effect on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave pairing, respectively, ensuring an absolutely dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC. While the phase fluctuations of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC are relatively weak around optimal doping, they become significant in both underdoped and overdoped regimes. We then identify a discontinuity on the superconducting dome in underdoped regime that results from a transition from a strong- to a weak-phase-fluctuating state as doping approaches the optimal point.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-purely transverse Magnus force in superconducting neutron stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05628v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The force acting on a proton vortex in extreme type-II superconducting neutron star matter is studied in the limit of vanishing temperature. A detailed analysis is presented on how momentum is transferred from length scales on the order of the London penetration depth to the vortex core. To examine the momentum flux, expressions for proton and electron currents are derived for arbitrary distances from the vortex line. It is shown that, in the regime of a large electron mean free path, the only force acting directly on the vortex core is the Magnus force. Notably, the correction to the proton current near the vortex core generates a component of the Magnus force aligned with the incident current measured far from the vortex. This contribution, responsible for longitudinal force, is usually overlooked in the literature. The results obtained in this work for a relatively simple problem concerning the force on a vortex in cold matter of neutron stars may also be relevant to other superconducting systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in Phys.

| **[Exploring unconventional superconductivity in PdTe via Point Contact Spectroscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05267v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Palladium Telluride (PdTe), a non-layered intermetallic crystalline compound, has captured attention for its unique superconducting properties and strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate the superconducting state of PdTe using point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) spectroscopy. The experimental data are analyzed using the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model for s, p and d wave symmetries. Our results reveal clear evidence of unconventional superconductivity. The superconducting gap showing features consistent with either p-wave or d-wave pairing symmetries but cannot be fitted with s-wave symmetry. The observed anisotropic gap structure and deviations from conventional BCS behaviour highlight the complex nature of the pairing interactions in PdTe. These findings provide strong evidence of unconventional pairing symmetry in this material.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting susceptibility signal captured in a record wide pressure range](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05176v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the resistance signature of the high temperature superconductivity above 250 K in highly compressed hydrides (more than 100 GPa) has garnered significant attention within the condensed matter physics community. This has sparked renewed optimism for achieving superconductivity under room-temperature conditions. However, the superconducting diamagnetism, another crucial property for confirming the superconductivity, has yet to be conclusively observed. The primary challenge arises from the weak diamagnetic signals detected from the small samples compressed in diamond anvil cells. Therefore, the reported results of superconducting diamagnetism in hydrides have sparked intense debate, highlighting the urgent need for workable methodology to assess the validity of the experimental results. Here, we are the first to report the ultrahigh pressure measurements of the superconducting diamagnetism on Nb0.44Ti0.56, a commercial superconducting alloy, in a record-wide pressure range from 5 GPa to 160 GPa. We present detailed results on factors such as sample size, the diamagnetic signal intensity, the signal-to-noise ratio and the superconducting transition temperature across various pressures and different pressure transmitting media. These comprehensive results clearly demonstrate that this alloy is an ideal reference sample for evaluating superconductivity in compressed hydrides,validating the credibility of the experimental systems and superconducting diamagnetic results, as well as determining the nature of the superconductivity of the investigated sample. In addition, these results also provide a valuable benchmark for studying the pressure-induced superconductivity in other material families.</p></details> | 18 pages,4 figures |
| **[Quantum Acoustics with Superconducting Qubits in the Multimode Transition-Coupling Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05127v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid mechanical-superconducting systems for quantum information processing have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications. In such systems, the weak coupling regime, dominated by dissipation, has been extensively studied. The strong coupling regime, where coherent energy exchange exceeds losses, has also been widely explored. However, the transition-coupling regime, which lies between the above two and exhibits rich, unique physics, remains underexplored. In this study, we fabricate a tunable coupling device to investigate the coupling of a superconducting transmon qubit to a seven-mode surface acoustic wave resonator (SAWR), with a particular focus on the transition-coupling regime. Through a series of phonon oscillation experiments and studies in the dispersive regime, we systematically characterize the performance of the SAWR. We then explore the complex dynamics of energy exchange between the qubit and the mechanical modes, highlighting the interplay between dissipation and coherence. Finally, we propose a protocol for qubit readout and fast reset with a multimode mechanical cavity using one mode for readout and another mode for reset. We have demonstrated in simulation that the qubit achieves both fast reset and high coherence performance when the qubit is coupled to the reset mode in the transition-coupling regime.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac Fermions on Honeycomb lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04945v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study superconducting (SC) phases that are naturally proximate to a spin-orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac semi-metal on a honeycomb lattice. This system, which offers enhanced low-energy symmetries, presents an interesting platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity in j=3/2 electrons. In particular, we find 72 superconducting charge-$2e$ fermion bilinears which, under classification of microscopic symmetries, lead to 12 different SCs -- four singlets, two doublets, and six triplets -- 7 of them are gapped and 5 are symmetry-protected nodal SCs. The strong spin-orbit coupling leads to locking of the spin of the Cooper pairs with real-space direction -- as is evident from the structure of the Cooper pair wave-functions -- leading to unusual non-unitary superconductors (even singlets), and with finite momentum pairing (for the triplets). This results, in many cases, in the magnitude of multiple pairing gaps being intricately dependent on the direction of the SC order-parameter. The present classification of SCs along with normal phases (Phys. Rev. B 108, 245106 (2023)) provides the complete list of naturally occurring phases in the vicinity of such a SU(8) Dirac semi-metal. This study allows for understanding the global phase diagram of such systems, stimulating further experimental work on candidate materials such as metallic halides (MX$_3$ with M=Zr, Hf, and X=Cl, Br). Further, it provides the starting point for the exploration of unconventional phase transitions in such systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The spatial correlation of radiation-induced errors in superconducting devices decays over a millimeter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04902v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perform nanosecond-resolution multiplexed readout on six same-chip superconducting microwave resonators. This allows us to pinpoint the impact positions of ionizing radiation on the chip by measuring the differential time of flight of the generated phonons, inducing correlated errors in the device, thereby implementing an on-chip seismic array. We correlate the phase response of each resonator - a proxy for the absorbed energy - to the distance from the impact point to uncover a millimetric decay length for the phonon-mediated radiation poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01271v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</p></details> |  |

| **[Comparative analysis of methods for calculating Hubbard parameters using cRPA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11142v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a systematic comparison of various approaches within the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) for calculating the Coulomb interaction parameter $U$. While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO$_{2}$ (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO$_{3}$ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent magnetism and spin liquids in an extended Hubbard description of moiré bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06339v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study an extended Hubbard model with both on-site and off-site repulsive interactions, in which Mott insulating states with concomitant charge order occur at fractional fillings. To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagom\'e geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moir\'e TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

The paper is devoted to the reduced version of this task in which one only computes the real quantities called singular values. It is shown that in such an approach (and under suitable constraints including the tridiagonality of the Hamiltdonian) the singular values can be sought as poles of an auxiliary Green's function expressible in terms of a doublet of matrix continued fractions. A family of multi-bosonic Bose-Hubbard-like complex Hamiltonians is recalled for illustration purposes.</p></details> | 31 pp., 3 pictures |
| **[A Hubbard exciton fluid in a photo-doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05566v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The undoped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator naturally has one charge carrier per lattice site. When it is doped with additional carriers, they are unstable to spin fluctuation-mediated Cooper pairing as well as other unconventional types of charge, spin, and orbital current ordering. Photo-excitation can produce charge carriers in the form of empty (holons) and doubly occupied (doublons) sites that may also exhibit charge instabilities. There is evidence that antiferromagnetic correlations enhance attractive interactions between holons and doublons, which can then form bound pairs known as Hubbard excitons, and that these might self-organize into an insulating Hubbard exciton fluid. However, this out-of-equilibrium phenomenon has not been detected experimentally. Here, we report the transient formation of a Hubbard exciton fluid in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ using ultrafast terahertz conductivity. Following photo-excitation, we observe rapid spectral weight transfer from a Drude metallic response to an insulating response. The latter is characterized by a finite energy peak originating from intra-excitonic transitions, whose assignment is corroborated by our numerical simulations of an extended Hubbard model. The lifetime of the peak is short, approximately one picosecond, and scales exponentially with Mott gap size, implying extremely strong coupling to magnon modes.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages main text, 4 figures, 4 extended figures, 19 pages supplementary information</p></details> |
| **[Magnetic ground states of highly doped two-leg Hubbard ladders with a particle bath](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05350v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the ground-state magnetism of a Hubbard model in a system consisting of a main frame (subsystem) and a particle bath (center sites). The hole doping in the main frame is controlled by adjusting the chemical potential of the particle bath. In the weakly doped region, the saturated ferromagnetic state emerges due to the Nagaoka mechanism [Phys. Rev. B 90, 224426 (2014)]. However, in the highly doped region, a variety of intriguing magnetic states are observed, including partially polarized states and nonmagnetic states. To understand these states, we analyze the state of the subsystem by comparing its properties with those of a two-leg ladder system, which corresponds to the subsystem with the center sites removed. Furthermore, to gain insight into the microscopic origin of the magnetic phase diagram, we study the ground state of the corresponding effective t-J model, derived from the Hubbard model by considering the second-order processes of the electron hopping. The phase diagram is well reproduced by the effective t-J model, which includes the three-site pair-hopping term. To elucidate the competition among different energy contributions, such as potential, kinetic, and magnetic energies, we classify the energies within the effective t-J model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Disordered solid to Bose-glass transition in Bose-Hubbard model with disorder and long-range interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04476v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of disorder in Bose-Hubbard model gives rise to new glassy quantum phases, namely the Bose-glass (BG) and disordered solid (DS) phases. In this work, we present the rich phase diagram of interacting bosons in disordered two-dimensional optical lattice, modelled by the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. We systematically probe the effect of long-range interaction truncated to the nearest neighbors and next-nearest neighbors on the phase diagram. We investigate the zero-temperature ground-state quantum phases using the single-site Gutzwiller mean field (SGMF) theory. We also employ strong-coupling perturbative expansion to identify the nature of ground-state solid phases analytically. At sufficiently high disorder strength, we observe a quantum phase transition between the DS and BG phases. We have investigated this transition in greater detail using cluster Gutzwiller mean field theory to study the effect of inter-site correlations which is absent in the SGMF method. We have also studied this phase transition from the perspective of percolation theory.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

However, accurately modeling these in transition-metal and rare-earth compounds remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a fully first-principles approach for calculating spin-wave spectra based on time-dependent (TD) density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), using nonempirical Hubbard functionals. This approach is implemented in a general noncollinear formulation, enabling the study of magnons in both collinear and noncollinear magnetic systems. Unlike methods that rely on empirical Hubbard $U$ parameters to describe the ground state, and Heisenberg Hamiltonians for describing magnetic excitations, the methodology developed here probes directly the dynamical spin susceptibility (efficiently evaluated with TDDFPT throught the Liouville-Lanczos approach), and treats the linear variation of the Hubbard augmentation (in itself calculated non-empirically) in full at a self-consistent level. Furthermore, the method satisfies the Goldstone condition without requiring empirical rescaling of the exchange-correlation kernel or explicit enforcement of sum rules, in contrast to existing state-of-the-art techniques. We benchmark the novel computational scheme on prototypical transition-metal monoxides NiO and MnO, showing remarkable agreement with experiments and highlighting the fundamental role of these newly implemented Hubbard corrections. The method holds great promise for describing collective spin excitations in complex materials containing localized electronic states.</p></details> |  |

When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+25 ...</summary><p>5+25 pages; 4 figures</p></details> |

Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in the intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We show that charge frustration - induced by electronic polarization effects - stabilizes unconventional insulating states in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model. Using exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group, we uncover a charge-disordered phase that remains insulating despite lacking long-range order and possessing an effectively attractive on-site interaction - a behavior reminiscent of gapful spin liquids in frustrated spin systems. We also identify a fragile ferroelectric phase and a charge-density-wave state with emergent eight-site periodicity. These findings establish charge frustration, driven by charge-dipole interactions, as a robust mechanism for realizing exotic phases in low-dimensional correlated systems, with implications for organic conductors, transition-metal oxides, and ultracold polar molecules.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

This method enables the computation of a series of two-body Feynman diagrams for the Luttinger--Ward (LW) functional using a one-loop truncation. This approach enables us to study the U(1) quantum spin liquid phase characterized by a spinon Fermi surface and to derive the Green's functions for spinons, chargons, and electrons. Our findings extend beyond the standard mean-field approximation by accounting for the effects of gauge field fluctuations.The spatial components of the U(1) gauge field are equivalently represented by interactions that incorporate corrections from the spinon-chargon two-particle random phase approximation. This framework effectively captures the long-range correlations inherent to the U(1) quantum spin liquid and combines non-perturbative quantum field theory with the projective construction, providing new insights into the study of quantum spin liquids and other strongly correlated electron systems. We demonstrate that our approach correctly reprodues the anomalous low-temperature behavior of specific heat -- namely, the upturn in $C_V/T$ as a function of $T^2$-- in agreement with recent measurments on 1$T$ - TaS$_2$. Moreover, this approach reproduces the resonant peaks in the Mott gap, as observed in cobalt atoms on single-layer 1$T$-TaSe$_{2}$</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

The interplay of interactions and non-hermiticity results in insulating behavior with a phase diagram divided into three distinct regions, exhibiting either topologically gapped or (real) gapless regimes and a trivial phase. The latter is mapped by the emergence of a local order parameter associated with a charge density wave. A ${\cal PT}$-symmetry breaking at the low-lying spectrum occurs when increasing the gain-loss magnitude at a fixed interaction strength, marking the transition from gapped to gapless topological behavior. Further increase leads to the onset of charge ordering in a first-order phase transition in which level crossing takes place in the spectrum's imaginary part. The support that the staggered gain and loss display to robust charge density wave in equilibrium is confirmed in the real-time dynamics in the presence of non-hermiticity, suggesting that engineered gain and loss can be used to tailor an ordered many-body state in experiments.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Contemporary tensor network approaches to gapless and topological phases in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00106v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of numerically efficient computational methods has facilitated in depth studies of various correlated phases of matter including critical and topological phases. A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity and trimers on attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21630v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the interplay between superconducting correlations and trimer formation in polarized two-component Fermi gases confined to multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three fermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where $2n_{\uparrow} = n_{\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer formation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results demonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width, effectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure from the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of four legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes negligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment where FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states. These findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed light on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation in strongly correlated fermionic systems. Our work has implications for understanding unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, presented on PCT 2025 Conference, to be published in Communications in Computer and Information Science</p></details> |

In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great insight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 74 references; RevTeX class, double-column formatting, includes also Supplemental Materials (5 pages, 3 figures, 9 multimedia filies)</p></details> |

In agreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short range magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping region $0.05\lesssim x \lesssim 0.1$.

Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase that survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\eta $% -pairing eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that the same quasi-$\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a way of the control of an $\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.</p></details> |  |

Exact and approximate solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19680v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the tight-binding model taking into account the Coulomb repulsion of electrons at one site (the Hubbard model), an exact calculation of the Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function of the C2 dimer as a structural element of fullerene, the poles of which determine the energy spectrum of the studied nanosystem, was performed. Graphic representations of the equation for the chemical potential and the density of state of electrons were obtained. A solution for the dimer was obtained within the approximation of static fluctuations. The Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function, obtained in the approximation of static fluctuations, coincided with a similar function obtained within the exact solution. The ionization energy and electron affinity were calculated and found to be 11.87 eV and 3.39 eV, respectively. It was concluded that the method for solving the Hubbard model for the C2 dimer in the approximation of static fluctuations proposed in the work can be a fairly adequate method for theoretical study of strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors. This work lays the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical investigations into the unique electronic properties of these emerging materials.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model.

| **[Superconductivity in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Under Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06450v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity (SC) in the trilayer nickelate compound La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has generated significant interest. In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance SC within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens SC by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens SC. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional SC of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity. Our findings indicate that interlayer Coulomb interactions are crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, achieving superconductivity in this system currently requires relatively high pressures. In this study, we propose a chemical pressure strategy via Sr substitution to stabilize high-Tc superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient conditions.Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1) at ambient pressure and identify two dynamically stable phases:La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$.Our calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallization of the $\sigma$-bonding bands dominated by Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals-a key feature associated with high-Tc superconductivity, as reported in the high-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Further analysis using tight-binding models shows that the key hopping parameters in La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$ closely resemble those of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, indicating that strong super-exchange interactions between interlayer Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals are preserved. These findings suggest that Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a promising candidate for realizing high-Tcsuperconductivity at ambient pressure.</p></details> |  |

The La(2)$_{\rm a}$ site of the ideal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ is clearly distinguished from the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site close to the local defects. Below 150K, almost half of the intrinsic La(2)$_{\rm a}$ sites are dominated by a finite internal field within the $ab$ plane, while the other half are dominated by zero internal field. The result is fully consistent with the single spin-spinless stripe order of ($\cdots\uparrow\circ\downarrow\circ\uparrow\circ\cdots$), where the reduced Ni magnetic moments are parallel to the $ab$-plane. Even for the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site, the result is also explained within the same model by considering the inhomogeneous internal magnetic fields enhanced around the nearby defects such as oxygen vacancies.

We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility via Fermi surface nesting, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations.

Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML in our zero- and finite-temperature calculations. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low Resistance P-type Contacts to Monolayer WSe$_2$ through Chlorinated Solvent Doping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21102v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) is a promising p-type semiconductor limited by high contact resistance ($R_\textrm{C}$) and the lack of a reliable doping strategy. Here, we demonstrate that exposing WSe$_2$ to chloroform provides simple and stable p-type doping. In monolayer WSe$_2$ transistors with Pd contacts, chloroform increases the maximum hole current by over 100$\times$ (>200 $\mu$A/$\mu$m), reduces $R_\textrm{C}$ to ~2.5 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m, and retains an on/off ratio of $10^{10}$ at room temperature. These improvements persist for over 8 months, survive annealing above 150 {\deg}C, and remain effective down to 10 K, enabling a cryogenic $R_\textrm{C}$ of ~1 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Density functional theory indicates that chloroform strongly physisorbs to WSe$_2$, inducing hole doping with minimal impact on the electronic states between the valence band and conduction band edges. Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy reveal that chloroform intercalates at the WSe$_2$ interface with the gate oxide, contributing to doping stability and mitigating interfacial dielectric disorder. This robust, scalable approach enables high-yield WSe$_2$ transistors with good p-type performance.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Accompanying the superconductivity and a correlated insulator phase is the Kondo-lattice-like phenomenology in transport properties. Here we consider how such phenomenology can develop when the combination of the active bands are topological. We advance a unique construction of compact molecular orbitals through a partial Wannierization that is symmetry preserving. The resulting Anderson lattice model provides the basis for a microscopic understanding of the experimental observation, including the involved energy scales.

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11763v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band's natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters; 7 + 9 pages, 4 + 6 figures</p></details> |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe and WSe$_2$ nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to $2.2\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for SnSe$_2$ and up to $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for WSe$_2$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Schottky-barrier-height in high-symmetry 2D WSe$_2$: Momentum-space anisotropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11005v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is usually supposed that only low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit anisotropy, here we show that high-symmetry 2D semiconductors can show significant anisotropy in momentum space due to the band structure anisotropy in k-space. The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04131v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrupolar Excitons in MoSe$_2$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18040v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for platforms to generate and control exotic excitonic states has greatly benefited from the advent of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their heterostructures. Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript just accepted in Nature Communications.

| **[Spin-valley polarization control in WSe$_2$ monolayers using photochemical doping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03049v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Here we demonstrate a subtle competition between cavity frequency and interlayer tunneling in graphene stacks that is responsible for topological phase transitions in light-matter Hilbert space and that cannot be captured by mean-field theory in vacuum. A systematic exploration of multilayer graphene heterostructures and stacking configurations in a chiral tHz cavity reveals that linear dispersion enhances the low-energy cavity-induced topological gap. Furthermore, in bilayer graphene, a displacement field drives the low-energy vacuum band from valley-Chern to Chern insulator, comprising a gate-tunable topological phase transition. Our findings pave the way for future control and engineering of graphene heterostructures with chiral cavity fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Fig...</summary><p>5 Figures in the main text, Supplementary material is appended</p></details> |

A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wave vector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--P\'erot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene near the Dirac point increases conductance but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 captioned figures.

| **[Microscopic theory for electron-phonon coupling in twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03293v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene -- whether phonon-driven or electron-driven -- remains unresolved, in part due to the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a first-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer graphene for arbitrary twist angles without requiring a periodic moir\'e supercell. Our approach combines a momentum-space continuum model for both electronic and phononic structures with a generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory beyond the adiabatic approximation. Using this framework, we find that the EPC is strongly enhanced near the magic angle. The superconducting transition temperature induced by low-energy phonons peaks at $1.1^\circ$ around 1 K, and remains finite for a range of angles both below and above the magic angles. We predict that superconductivity persists up to $\sim 1.4^\circ$, where superconductivity has been recently observed despite the dispersive electronic bands. Beyond a large density of states, we identify a key condition for strong EPC: resonance between the electronic bandwidth and the dominant phonon frequencies. We also show that the EPC strength of a specific phonon corresponds to the modification of the moir\'e potential. In particular, we identify several $\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to the EPC, which are experimentally detectable via Raman spectroscopy.</p></details> |  |

Here, we explore the nature of emergent localized states at the edges of twisted bilayer graphene nanoribbons. Based on an extended tight-binding Hamiltonian, which includes hopping energy within a wide atomic neighborhood, we investigate the nature of the electronic states responsible for the transport along the four graphene nanoribbon terminals. The emphasis is on discussing the role of the stacking region symmetries, the twisted angle between the crossed zigzag nanoribbons, and also the width of the ribbons in the electronic and transport responses of the four terminals. Our findings show a direct connection between the number of non-equivalent sites on the edge of the stacking region and the localized states, in accordance with reported scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. Within the parameters explored, the twist angle was revealed to be the most powerful tool to control transport responses in the investigated 4-terminal devices, including special electronic beam splitter phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse electronic phases correlated with twist-angle distribution and pseudomagnetic field in turbostratic graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05854v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twisted multilayer graphene has become a focal point of research due to its ability to host a range of quantum phases, including unconventional superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and strong correlation effects. In the present work, we address the challenge of investigating the diverse physics associated with a variety of twist-angles in a simple graphene platform which is economic and bypasses the tedious process of fabricating multiple devices, each with one twist angle. We used turbostratic graphene films containing a variety of twist angles characterized by distinct Moir\'e patterns observed through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and distinct signatures recorded by Raman spectroscopy. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we show that the local twist angles remarkably correlate with the characteristic local electronic properties. Most remarkably, the films spontaneously generate strained wrinkles during growth, with certain wrinkled regions exhibiting robust strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields, as recorded by ultra-low temperature STS.</p></details> | 26 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Angle-Tuned Gross-Neveu Quantum Criticality in Twisted Bilayer Graphene: A Quantum Monte Carlo Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11382v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fascinating quantum many-body states in twisted bilayber graphene (TBG) at magic angle, due to the interplay of Coulomb interactions and the quantum metrics of flat bands, have been well understood both experimentally and theoretically. However, the phase diagram and excitations as functions of twist angle and permittivity are still largely unknown. Here, via a newly developed momentum-space continuous-field quantum Monte Carlo method fully taking into account long-ranged Coulomb interactions and flat bands' quantum metrics with system sizes that were not accessible before, we show that charge-neutral TBG realizes an angle-tuned quantum phase transition from a gapped Kramers intervalley coherence (KIVC) state to a Dirac semimetal with critical angles around 1.2$\deg$. In single-particle spectra we demonstrate the evolution of a minimum gap at $\Gamma$ at the magic angle and towards touching points at Brillouin zone corners as the angle increases. The free energy and KIVC order parameter show that the transition belongs to fermionic Gross-Neveu criticality, and is robust upon varying the permittivity or the interlayer hopping.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

This research work investigates cerium-doped graphene-based materials as catalysts for this process with density functional theory calculations. The electrochemical performance of Ce-doped graphene was assessed within the computation hydrogen electrode framework. Our findings reveal that Ce doping, especially when synergized with an oxygen atom, shows improved catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, Ce doping in combination with an oxygen atom, located near a border, can be selective for the 2-electron pathway. Overall, the combination of Ce doping with structural defects and oxygenated functions lowers the reaction free energies for the oxygen reduction compared to pure graphene, and consequently, might improve the catalytic activity. This research sheds light from a computational perspective on Ce-doped carbon materials as a sustainable alternative to traditional costly metal-based catalysts, offering promising prospects for green energy technologies and electrochemical applications.</p></details> |  |

A Fermi surface with reduced symmetry is intimately tied to unusual transport properties such as anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear Hall effect. Here, combining theoretical calculations and transport measurements, we report the discovery of a new class of bulk Fermi surface structure with unprecedented low symmetry, the ``Fermi lune", with peculiar crescent shaped Fermi energy contours, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. This emergent Fermi-lune structure driven by electron-electron interactions spontaneously breaks time-reversal, mirror, and rotational symmetries, leading to two distinctive phenomena: giant intrinsic non-reciprocity in longitudinal transport and a new type of magnetism termed ``transdimensional orbital magnetism". Coupling the Fermi lune to a superlattice potential further produces a novel Chern insulator exhibiting quantized anomalous Hall effect controlled by in-plane magnetic field. Our work unveils a new symmetry breaking state of matter in the transdimensional regime, which opens an avenue for exploring correlated and topological quantum phenomena in symmetry breaking phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures ,1 table in main text. 7 figures in Supplementary Materials</p></details> |

Here, we propose a generic strategy for the construction of fully 2D magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on transition metal-intercalated graphene electrodes with $h$-BN barrier layer. First-principles calculations reveal that intercalation not only stabilizes uniform atomic dispersion via steric hindrance but also induces robust ferromagnetism in graphene. Manganese- and vanadium-intercalated systems (Mn-Gr and V-Gr) exhibit exceptional spintronic performance, with tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) showing a pronounced odd-even oscillation as a function of barrier thickness. A giant TMR of $4.35 \times 10^8\,\%$ is achieved in the Mn-Gr system with a monolayer barrier $h$ -BN ($n=1$), while V-Gr reaches a maximum TMR of $1.86 \times 10^5\,\%$ for a trilayer barrier ($n=3$). Moreover, biaxial strain further enhances the TMR to $10^9\,\%$ and $10^7\,\%$ in Mn-Gr and V-Gr systems, respectively. The devices also exhibit perfect spin filtering and pronounced negative differential resistance, offering new opportunities for high-performance spintronic and memory applications based on 2D van der Waals heterostructures.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

The bias and the chemical potential are controlled by electrostatic gating where the top and bottom gate voltages are tuned separately. The value of the band gap opened by the bias field is influenced by the self screening of the bilayer graphene. The Hartree contribution to the self screening is well known in literature, with Hartree screening significantly renormalizing the gap. In the present work we derive the Fock contribution to the self screening and demonstrate that it is equally important and in the low density regime even more important than the Hartree contribution. We calculate the Hartree-Fock screened band gap as a function of electron doping at zero temperature and also as a function of temperature at zero doping.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

The Dirac equation for this configuration does not admit analytical solutions in terms of known special functions. Using the WKB approximation, we demonstrate that for gapped graphene the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition for eigenenergies includes an additional valley-dependent geometrical phase. When this term is accounted for, the WKB approximation exhibits good agreement with results from the exact diagonalization method except to the lowest Landau level.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

We model the helical graphene surface as a smooth, continuous, and distortion-free manifold, effectively adopting the continuum approximation. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helical background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helical pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helical graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Covalent functionalization offers a deeper tuning of the geometric and electronic structure of graphene compared to non-covalent methods; however, the existing techniques involve side reactions and spatially uncontrolled functionalization, pushing research toward more selective and controlled methods. A promising approach is 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, successfully utilized with carbon nanotubes. In the present work, this method has been extended to graphene flakes with low defect concentration. A key innovation is the use of a custom-synthesized ylide with a protected amine group (Boc), facilitating subsequent attachment of functional molecules. Indeed, after Boc cleavage, fluorescent dyes (Atto 425, 465, and 633) were covalently linked via NHS ester derivatization. This approach represents a highly selective method of minimizing structural damage. Successful functionalization was demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy, confirming the effectiveness of the method. This novel approach offers a versatile platform, enabling its use in biological imaging, sensing, and advanced nanodevices. The method paves the way for the development of sensors and devices capable of anchoring a wide range of molecules, including quantum dots and nanoparticles.

Blends host a fraction of water molecules absorbed by the poly(vinyl alcohol) phase. Dc conductivity and dielectric relaxation occur via fluctuation induced tunneling of electrons. Electric charge transport is affected by the glass transition of the polymer matrix and the rotational and translational dynamics of absorbed water molecules. In the present work, absorbed water was subtracted by annealing and pumping and, subsequently, dry blends were characterized by employing Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy at combined temperature and pressure states. Conductivity and relaxation obey fluctuation induced tunneling temperature dependencies. The corresponding activation energies and activation volumes reveal the role of absorbed polar water molecules on the tunneling current for macroscopic or localized electron transport.</p></details> |  |

We observe periodic oscillations of resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the $\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting $\pi$ qubits.</p></details> |  |

Central to this framework is the introduction of magic holes, a topological feature that captures the global source of computational hardness in simulating quantum systems. Unlike conventional measures, the complexity of QCS is governed by the topological entanglement entropy associated with these magic holes. We show that Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of magic holes and thus efficiently simulable within our model. To capture the interaction structure of magic holes, we define a topological tensor network representation and develop novel skein relations and reduction algorithms to simplify circuit representations. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of classical simulations and provides a unified explanation for the tractability of various known quantum circuit classes.

We investigate the utility of Tree Tensor Network (TTN) states to solve the dynamics of the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. Within the perturbative regime of small transverse fields, TTNs faithfully reproduce analytically known, but non-trivial and physically interesting results, for lattices up to $16 \times 16$ sites. Limitations of the method related to the rapid growth of entanglement entropy are explored within more general, paradigmatic quench settings. We provide and discuss comprehensive benchmarks regarding the benefit of \emph{GPU} acceleration and the impact of using local operator sums on the performance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

For concrete calculations we use free massive scalar field theory in two-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, but the results generalize to other models and higher dimensions. Finally, our results lead us to propose a new approach to the unification of quantum field theory with gravity, the QFT vector model, which combines insights and techniques from various current approaches to quantum gravity such as causal dynamical triangulations, random tensor models, group field theory, emergent gravity and holography.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17215v3)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures, Mathematica codes accompanying this paper are available at https://github.com/lagrenge94/Mathematica-codes-for-Hopf-algebras-and-solvable-unitary-circuits</p></details> |

| **[2D Quon Language: Unifying Framework for Cliffords, Matchgates, and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06336v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Distributed Tensor Network Library for Quantum Computing Emulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06119v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks offer an adaptable and efficient approach to emulation of quantum computers. Their usage relies on partitioning circuits into small tensors, which are contracted together to form the final result. While this approach intends to minimise the problem size, exceeding the locally available memory is sometimes unavoidable due to the exponential nature of quantum systems. Most HPC tensor network packages tackle this issue with a procedure called circuit slicing, which distributes the entire network onto multiple ranks, recombining it back when necessary. In this study, we present a novel alternative approach, where individual tensors are both broadcast and scattered to harness multiple levels of parallelism. The technique is abstracted behind a fixed distribution pattern, and actualised in a new portable tensor network library, QTNH, built on top of MPI and ScaLAPACK. We showcase its capabilities on ARCHER2, by emulating two well-known algorithms - the Quantum Fourier Transform and Random Circuit Sampling. This is accomplished by leveraging the implemented operations to realise various contraction strategies, including a unique distributed MPS tensor factorisation approach. We thus demonstrate that our library can be used to advance the accuracy of quantum emulation, while offering a simple and flexible interface to tensor distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[TTNOpt: Tree tensor network package for high-rank tensor compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05908v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have developed TTNOpt, a software package that utilizes tree tensor networks (TTNs) for quantum spin systems and high-dimensional data analysis. TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by locally optimizing the network structure, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors. For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation. The optimized TTN shows that its structure isolates the variables from each other. (3) Reconstruction of the matrix product network representing a $16$-variable normal distribution characterized by a tree-like correlation structure. TTNOpt can reveal hidden correlation structures of the covariance matrix.</p></details> | 18pages, 11 figures |
| **[Towards secondary structure prediction of longer mRNA sequences using a quantum-centric optimization scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05782v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of mRNA secondary structure is critical for understanding gene expression, translation efficiency, and advancing mRNA-based therapeutics. However, the combinatorial complexity of possible foldings, especially in long sequences, poses significant computational challenges for classical algorithms. In this work, we propose a scalable, quantum-centric optimization framework that integrates quantum sampling with classical post-processing to tackle this problem. Building on a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the mRNA folding task, we develop two complementary workflows: a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based variational quantum algorithm enhanced with gauge transformations and local search, and an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit-based scheme where training is done classically and sampling is delegated to quantum hardware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches using IBM quantum processors, solving problem instances with up to 156 qubits and circuits containing up to 950 nonlocal gates, corresponding to mRNA sequences of up to 60 nucleotides. Additionally, we validate scalability of the CVaR algorithm on a tensor network simulator, reaching up to 354 qubits in noiseless settings. These results demonstrate the growing practical capabilities of hybrid quantum-classical methods for tackling large-scale biological optimization problems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

In such cases, capturing the complex thermalization process requires a detailed understanding of how particles evolve and interact with a hot medium. Considering the open lattice Schwinger model and using tensor network algorithms, we investigate the thermalization dynamics of mesonic particles in a hot medium, such as the Schwinger boson or the electric flux string. We simulate systems with up to 100 lattice sites, achieving accurate preservation of the electric field parity symmetry, demonstrating the algorithm's robustness and scalability. Our results reveal that the thermalization time increases with stronger dissipation from the environment, increasing environment temperature, higher background electric field and heavier fermion masses. Further, we study the quantum mutual information between the two halves of the flux string connecting a meson's constituent particles and analyze its relation to relevant dynamical observables.</p></details> | 30 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00781v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational quantum computing offers a flexible computational paradigm with applications in diverse areas. However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 boxes, updated to published version</p></details> |
| **[Planar fault-tolerant circuits for non-Clifford gates on the 2D color code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05175v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a family of scalable planar fault-tolerant circuits that implement logical non-Clifford operations on a 2D color code, such as a logical $T$ gate or a logical non-Pauli measurement that prepares a magic $|T\rangle$ state. The circuits are relatively simple, consisting only of physical $T$ gates, $CX$ gates, and few-qubit measurements. They can be implemented with an array of qubits on a 2D chip with nearest-neighbor couplings, and no wire crossings. The construction is based on a spacetime path integral representation of a non-Abelian 2+1D topological phase, which is related to the 3D color code. We turn the path integral into a circuit by expressing it as a spacetime $ZX$ tensor network, and then traversing it in some chosen time direction. We describe in detail how fault tolerance is achieved using a "just-in-time" decoding strategy, for which we repurpose and extend state-of-the-art color-code matching decoders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation in split-index matrix product states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15883v4)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries including anomalous symmetries, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing quantum teleportation and constrained spin chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4: P...</summary><p>v4: Published version. v2: Extended discussion on anomalous symmetries</p></details> |

Recently, Aizpurua et al. demonstrated explainable anomaly detection with matrix product states on a discrete-valued cyber-security task, using quantum-inspired methods to gain insight into the learned model and detected anomalies. Here, we extend this framework to real-valued data domains. We furthermore introduce tree tensor networks for the task of explainable anomaly detection. We demonstrate these methods with three benchmark problems, show adequate predictive performance compared to several baseline models and both tensor network architectures' ability to explain anomalous samples. We thereby extend the application of tensor networks to a broader class of potential problems and open a pathway for future extensions to more complex tensor network architectures.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Typical Machine Learning Datasets as Low-Depth Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03399v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that investigates the capabilities of quantum computers for learning tasks. While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g., by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01896v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Regularized second-order optimization of tensor-network Born machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18691v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor-network Born machines (TNBMs) are quantum-inspired generative models for learning data distributions. Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability and efficiency, and demonstrating its potential as a robust and scalable approach for optimizing quantum-inspired generative models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[HMAE: Self-Supervised Few-Shot Learning for Quantum Spin Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03140v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum machine learning for spin and molecular systems faces critical challenges of scarce labeled data and computationally expensive simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.</p></details> |  |

This method extends the MeLoCoToN algorithm for inversion and optimization problems with continuous variables, by using Field Tensor Networks. The fundamentals of the method are the conversion of the problem of minimization of $N$ continuous variables into a problem of maximization of a dependent functional of a single variable. It can also be adapted to determine other properties, such as the zeros of any function. For this purpose, we use an extension of the imaginary time evolution, the new method of continuous signals, and partial or total integration, depending on the case. In addition, we show a direct way to recover both the tensor networks and the MeLoCoToN from this formalism. We show some examples of application, such as the Riemann hypothesis resolution. We provide an explicit integral equation that gives the solution of the Riemann hypothesis, being that if it results in a zero value, it is correct; otherwise, it is wrong. This algorithm requires no deep mathematical knowledge and is based on simple mathematical properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 15 figures, any suggestions are welcome</p></details> |

Tuning the transverse field $h$ and the dilution $p$, the quantum phase diagram of both models is explored. Both quantum phase diagrams show long-range order for small $h$ and small $p$. The ordered phase of each is separated from the disordered (quantum) Griffiths phase by second-order phase transitions on two critical lines touching at a multi-critical point. Using Binder ratios we locate quantum critical points with high accuracy. The order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the average correlation-length exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ are determined along the critical lines and at the multi-critical points for the first time via finite-size scaling. We find three internally consistent sets of critical exponents and compare them with potentially connected universality classes. The quantum Griffiths phase in the vicinity of the phase transition lines is analyzed through the local susceptibility. Our results indicate that activated scaling occurs not only at the percolation transition, but also at the phase transition line for $p$ smaller than the percolation threshold $p_c$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18937v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave function in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo description of correlated electrons in two-dimensional FeSe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05883v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic correlation effects on the structural properties of double-layer FeSe are studied using variation and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods. The Slater-Jastrow many-body wavefunction with two different forms for the homogeneous two-body pair-correlation term is used. The ground-state energy of the system is obtained at the thermodynamic limit using two different trial wave functions called JDFT and JSD. Only the Jastrow factor is fully optimized in the JDFT wave function, while the Slater determinant comes from the density functional approximation. In the JSD trial wave function, the Slater determinant and the Jastrow factor are fully optimized simultaneously. We calculated the VMC and DMC energies as a function of interlayer separation for two different in-plane iron-iron bond lengths. Our QMC results indicate that the optimized interlayer separation decreases with increasing iron-iron bond length, driven by stretch. We found that a three- to two-dimensional phase transition increases the electron-electron correlation effects and shifts the system from moderately correlated to strongly correlated. The value of correlation energy implies that the Hubbard $U$ value, which is widely used in DFT+U calculations, for two-dimensional FeSe is larger than its value in bulk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo study of the quasiparticle effective mass of the two-dimensional uniform electron liquid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05879v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real-space variation quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to calculate the quasiparticle energy bands and the quasiparticle effective mass of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic two-dimensional uniform electron liquid (2D-UEL)\@. The many-body finite-size errors are minimized by performing simulations for three system sizes with the number of electrons $N=146$, 218, and 302 for paramagnetic and $N=151$ for ferromagnetic systems. We consider 2D-UEL to be within the metallic density range $1\leq r_s \leq 5$. The VMC and DMC results predict that the quasiparticle effective mass $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL at high density $r_s=1$ is very close to 1, suggesting that effective mass renormalization due to electron-electron interaction is negligible. We find that $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL obtained by the VMC and DMC methods increases by $r_s$ but with different slopes. Our VMC and DMC results for ferromagnetic 2D-UEL indicate that $m^*$ decreases rapidly by reducing the density due to the strong suppression of the electron-electron interaction.</p></details> |  |

However, the phase diagram and excitations as functions of twist angle and permittivity are still largely unknown. Here, via a newly developed momentum-space continuous-field quantum Monte Carlo method fully taking into account long-ranged Coulomb interactions and flat bands' quantum metrics with system sizes that were not accessible before, we show that charge-neutral TBG realizes an angle-tuned quantum phase transition from a gapped Kramers intervalley coherence (KIVC) state to a Dirac semimetal with critical angles around 1.2$\deg$. In single-particle spectra we demonstrate the evolution of a minimum gap at $\Gamma$ at the magic angle and towards touching points at Brillouin zone corners as the angle increases. The free energy and KIVC order parameter show that the transition belongs to fermionic Gross-Neveu criticality, and is robust upon varying the permittivity or the interlayer hopping.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

Previous studies have focused mainly on periodic arrangements of the optical tweezers, which host various spatially ordered magnetic phases. Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state of quantum Ising models for amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms. These models are designed to feature well-controlled local structural properties in the absence of long-range order. Notably, by determining the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, we find evidence of a quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a spin-glass phase. The magnetic structure factor indicates short-range isotropic antiferromagnetic correlations. For the feasible sizes, the spin-overlap distribution features a nontrivial structure with two broad peaks and a sizable weight at zero overlap. The comparison against results for the clean kagome lattice, which features local structural properties similar to those of our amorphous arrays, highlights the important role of the absence of long-range structural order of the underlying array. Our findings indicate a route to experimentally implement the details of a Hamiltonian which hosts a quantum spin-glass phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Entanglement islands in 1D and 2D lattices with defects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02612v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the spatial structure of quantum entanglement in one- and two-dimensional lattice systems containing structural defects, using the Time-Dependent Quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method. By constructing reduced density matrices from ensembles of guide waves, we resolve spatial variations in both Coulomb-mediated entanglement and coherence without requiring full many-body wavefunctions. This approach reveals localized regions, entanglement islands, where quantum correlations are enhanced or suppressed due to the presence of vacancies or interaction inhomogeneities. In 1D systems, entanglement tends to concentrate near defects, while in 2D we observe bridge-like and radially symmetric domains. Our results demonstrate that TDQMC offers a scalable and physically transparent framework for real-space quantum information analysis, with implications for quantum materials, entanglement-based sensing, and coherent state engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo and Stabilizer States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09978v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum-Monte-Carlo technique known as the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) relies on a crucial no-branching condition: the SSE sampling is carried out in the computational basis, and the no-branching assumption ensures that superpositions of basis-states do not appear when operators are applied. Without this proviso, the number of complex amplitudes would grow exponentially with the number of qubits and would eventually overwhelm the memory and processing power of a classical computer. However, the action of Clifford group elements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without resorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow an extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that can be studied in this way. The method is also illustrated using the Transverse-Field Ising model.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Quantum Monte Carlo assessment of embedding for a strongly-correlated defect: interplay between mean-field and interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00845v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point defects are of interest for many applications, from quantum sensing to modifying bulk properties of materials. Because of their localized orbitals, the electronic states are often strongly correlated, which has led to a proliferation of quantum embedding techniques to treat this correlation. In these techniques, a weakly correlated reference such as density functional theory is used to treat most of the one-particle states, while certain states are singled out as an active space to be treated with an effective interaction. We assess these techniques in the context of an iron defect in aluminum nitride by referencing to a fully correlated quantum Monte Carlo description. This comparison allows us to have access to detailed information about the many-body wave functions, which are not available experimentally. We find that errors in the underlying density functional theory calculation, and thus choice of the active space, lead to qualitatively incorrect excited states from the embedded model. These errors are extremely difficult to recover from by adding corrections such as double counting or many-body perturbation theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables; includes Supplementary Material (15 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables)</p></details> |
| **[Single-site entanglement as a marker for quantum phase transitions at non-zero temperatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00628v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entanglement has been widely investigated in condensed matter systems since they are considered good candidates for developing quantum technologies. Additionally, entanglement is a powerful tool to explore quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated systems, with the von Neumann entropy being considered a proper measure of quantum entanglement for pure bipartite systems. For lattice systems, in particular, the single-site entanglement quantifies how much information about the quantum state of the remaining sites can be obtained by a measurement at a single site. Here, we use Quantum Monte Carlo calculations to obtain the average single-site entanglement for the two-dimensional Hubbard model in different geometries, probing the effects of varying temperature and interaction strength. We find that the average single-site entanglement signals the quantum phase transitions in such systems, allowing us to identify and characterize signatures of quantum phase transitions even at finite temperatures. We also analyze the relation between entanglement and magnetic susceptibility: in all the geometries considered, we find regimes in which the quantities are linearly connected. Our findings could then guide experiments to estimate entanglement via the susceptibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor cross interpolation approach for quantum impurity problems based on the weak-coupling expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12643v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm to solve equilibrium quantum impurity problems with high precision based on the weak-coupling expansion. The TCI algorithm, a kind of active learning method, factorizes high-dimensional integrals that appear in the perturbative expansion into a product of low-dimensional ones, enabling us to evaluate higher-order terms efficiently. This method is free from the sign problem which quantum Monte Carlo methods sometimes suffer from, and allows one to directly calculate the free energy. We benchmark the TCI impurity solver on an exactly solvable impurity model, and find good agreement with the exact solutions. We also incorporate the TCI impurity solver into the dynamical mean-field theory to solve the Hubbard model, and show that the metal-to-Mott insulator transition is correctly described with comparable accuracy to the Monte Carlo methods. Behind the effectiveness of the TCI approach for quantum impurity problems lies the fact that the integrands in the weak-coupling expansion naturally have a low-rank structure in the tensor-train representation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Contemporary tensor network approaches to gapless and topological phases in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00106v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of numerically efficient computational methods has facilitated in depth studies of various correlated phases of matter including critical and topological phases. A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Driven Critical Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Dirac Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19258v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and finite-time scaling (FTS) provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics from gapped initial states based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario. In this paper, by leveraging the large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the quantum critical point (QCP) triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order parameter bosons. A remarkable discovery is that, despite the existence of the gapless initial phase, the driven dynamics can still be captured by the FTS form. This leads us to propose a generalized criterion for the validity of KZM and FTS with a gapless initial state. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory to incorporate composite fluctuations and relax its requirement for a gapped initial state to systems accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitations. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to the strongly interacting Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+5 p...</summary><p>9+5 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing quantum computations with the synergy of auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo and computational basis tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20066v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce QC-CBT-AFQMC, a hybrid algorithm that incorporates computational basis tomography (CBT) into the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) method proposed by Huggins et al. [Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)], replacing the use of classical shadows. While the original QC-AFQMC showed high accuracy for quantum chemistry calculations, it required exponentially costly post-processing. Subsequent work using Matchgate shadows [Commun. Math. Phys. 404, 629 (2023)] improved scalability, but still suffers from prohibitive computational requirements that limit practical applications. Our QC-CBT-AFQMC approach uses shallow Clifford circuits with a quadratic reduction of two-qubit gates over the original algorithm, significantly reducing computational requirements and enabling accurate calculations under limited measurement budgets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and nitrogen molecule, producing potential energy curves that closely match established benchmarks. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques. These results highlight QC-CBT-AFQMC as a practical quantum-classical hybrid method that bridges the capabilities of quantum devices and accurate chemical simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale-invariant phase transition of disordered bosons in one dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17682v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha > 2$. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha>3$ our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hydrodynamics of particle-hole symmetric systems: a quantum Monte Carlo study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13273v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of hydrodynamic behavior in electronic flow within clean, particle-hole-symmetric systems at half-filling is a non-trivial problem. Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe the momentum flow, while experimental measurements typically capture the current flow profiles. However, in particle-hole-symmetric systems, electric current and momentum flow are entirely decoupled because electrons and holes move in opposite directions with equal distribution functions. This makes it challenging to link NS equations to observed flow patterns. In this work, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic behavior of the charge current at half filling can emerge despite the absence of momentum flow. By combining Boltzmann transport theory with numerically exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of clean graphene samples, we show that NS-type equations can be derived directly for the charge current, eliminating the need for any additional mechanism coupling the velocity field and charge current in explaining the experimentally observed hydrodynamic flow profiles in graphene at half-filling. We show that a new transport quantity - the current diffusion coefficient - replaces viscosity and expect this description to be valid for any particle-hole symmetric system. Our results provide new insights into the interpretation of experimental data and demonstrate how Quantum Monte Carlo calculations can serve as an alternative to experiments in transport measurements to verify the kinetic theory results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures Accepted for PRL</p></details> |
| **[Dual role of stripe phase on superconducting correlation in a bilayer square lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17212v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the stripe phase has been observed not only in monolayer cuprates but also in bilayer cuprates, research on its behavior in bilayer cuprates has been limited. Using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo, we explore the effect of stripes on the bilayer square lattice. We find the system exhibits short-range antiferromagnetism, which is enhanced by stripes and is strongest when the electron density of the interstriped rows reaches half-filling. The hole doping concentration plays a crucial role in the interaction between stripes and superconductivity. The $d$-wave pairing is enhanced by stripe potential $V_0$ at the hole doping $\delta_h=1/4$, whereas it is suppressed by stripe potential $V_0$ at the hole doping $\delta_h=1/8$. We elucidate this phenomenon through an analysis of the magnetism of the interstriped rows. Furthermore, the effective $d$-wave pairing is stronger in the bilayer model compared to the monolayer model when stripes are introduced on the square lattice. Overall, our unbiased numerical simulations provide a further understanding of the crossed bilayer square lattice model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |

Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages,2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2212.01823; text overlap with arXiv:2004.10565, arXiv:2202.00542</p></details> |
| **[Universal term of Entanglement Entropy in the $π$-flux Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10602v4)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

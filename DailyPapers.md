| **[Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages main text + 7 pages Appendix and References; 7 + 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Vacancy-Controlled Superconductivity in Rock-Salt Carbides: Towards Predictive Modelling of Real-World Superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07768v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We critically reexamine the superconducting properties of rock-salt transition-metal carbides (TMCs), often regarded as textbook conventional superconductors, combining first-principles electron-phonon calculations with variable-composition evolutionary structure prediction. Studying superconducting trends across the entire transition-metal series, we find that, when the rock-salt stoichiometric phase is dynamically or thermodynamically unstable, carbon-vacant structures identified through unbiased structure prediction permit to reconcile theoretical calculations with experimental trends. Our integrated use of structure prediction and electron-phonon calculations defines a general framework for realistic modelling of superconductors shaped by non-equilibrium synthesis routes and defect tolerance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting photocurrents induced by structured electromagnetic radiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07641v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a phenomenological theory describing the interaction of superconducting condensate with a Bessel beam of twisted light characterized by a nonzero angular momentum $m$. Starting from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model with the complex relaxation time we calculate the spatial profiles of dc photoinduced currents and magnetic fields as well as the second harmonic response. The photocurrents and magnetic fileds are shown to be determined both by the helicity of light and its orbital momentum $m$. Analyzing the half-space and thin film geometries we discuss possible experimental tests aimed to probe the superconducting photocurrents and magnetic fields.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Cavity-Altered Superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17378v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[What holes in superconductors reveal about superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07361v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a type I superconducting body that contains one or more holes in its interior that undergoes a transition between normal and superconducting states in the presence of a magnetic field. We argue that unlike other thermodynamic systems that undergo first order phase transitions the system cannot reach its equilibrium thermodynamic state, and that this sheds new light on the physics of the Meissner effect. How the Meissner effect occurs has not been addressed within the conventional theory of superconductivity, BCS. The situation considered in this paper indicates that expulsion of magnetic field requires physical elements absent from Hamiltonians assumed to describe superconductors within BCS theory. These physical elements are essential components of the alternative theory of hole superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-mode superconducting diode effect enabled by in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07354v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) has been cherished as a milestone in developing superconducting electronics. Tremendous efforts are being dedicated to realizing SDE in a wide variety of material platforms. Despite the diversity in the hosting materials and device designs, SDE is usually operated in a single mode which is enabled by either out-of-plane or in-plane magnetic field/magnetization. In this work, we report the realization of a dual-mode SDE in 2H-$\mathrm{NbS_2}$/2H-$\mathrm{NbSe_2}$ heterostructures where both the out-of-plane magnetic field $B_{\perp}$ and in-plane magnetic field $B_{||}$ can independently generate and manipulate SDE. The two modes share similar diode efficiency but differ in two aspects: 1. $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE is activated by a field on the order of 1 mT while $B_{||}$-induced SDE requires a field on the order of 100 mT; 2. $\eta$ of $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE exhibits a square-root like temperature dependence while $\eta$ of $B_{||}$-induced SDE takes a more linear-like one. We demonstrate that the dual-mode SDE is most likely a result of mirror symmetry breaking along multiple orientations. Thanks to the two orders difference in the operational field for the two modes, we propose a dual-functionality device scheme to showcase the potential of the dual-mode SDE in realizing advanced superconducting architecture, where fast polarity-switching functionality is implemented with $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE and high-fidelity functionality is enabled with $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unconventional Superconducting Pairing Symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: from the Perspective of Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disorder and the Robustness of Superconductivity on the Flat Band](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07095v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust, fast and high-fidelity composite single-qubit gates for superconducting transmon qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04155v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel quantum control method for superconducting transmon qubits that substantially outperforms conventional techniques in precision and robustness against coherent errors. Our approach leverages composite pulses (CP) to effectively mitigate system-specific errors, such as qubit frequency and anharmonicity variations. By utilizing CP, we demonstrate both complete and partial population transfers between qubit states, as well as the implementation of two essential single-qubit quantum gates. Simulations reveal substantial reductions in common error rates and gate durations. The effectiveness of our method is validated through four independent verification techniques, underscoring its potential for advancing quantum computing with superconducting qubits.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Spin pumping driven by magnon-polaritons in a ferromagnet-coplanar superconducting resonator hybrid system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06996v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate spin pumping driven by a strongly coupled magnon-photon system using a ferromagnet-coplanar superconducting resonator hybrid system at 1.4 K. Electrical readout via the inverse spin-Hall effect reveals characteristic coupling features, including mode splitting and linewidth broadening, demonstrating the electrical detection of strongly coupled microwave photons and magnons. The magnon-photon coupling strength obtained by combined spin pumping and inverse spin-Hall effect measurements is compared to microwave transmission experiments. Furthermore, microwave power-dependent measurements reveal a decrease in the coupling strength with increasing microwave power alongside the onset of nonlinearities of the superconducting resonator above a critical microwave power threshold.</p></details> |  |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. III: Einstein phonons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02121v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dispersionless limit of the standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied. The effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by Einstein phonons of frequency $\Omega>0$, equipped with electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda$. This allows for a detailed evaluation of the general results on $T_c$ for phonons with non-trivial dispersion relation, obtained in a previous paper, (II), by the authors. The variational principle for the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal state region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, obtained in (II), simplifies as follows: If $(\lambda,\Omega,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$, where $\varpi:=\Omega/2\pi T$, and where $\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)>0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences; $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ is the dispersionless limit $P(d\omega)\to\delta(\omega-\Omega)d\omega$ of the operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ of (II). It is shown that when $\varpi \leq \sqrt{2}$, then the map $\varpi\mapsto\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$ is invertible. For $\lambda>0.77$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) = \Omega f(\lambda)$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $f(\lambda)$ that converges to $f(\lambda)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,\Omega)$, which agrees with the asymptotic behavior $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) \sim C \Omega\sqrt{\lambda}$ for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $\Omega$, though with $C\approx 2.034 C_\infty$, where $C_\infty := \frac{1}{2\pi}\mathfrak{k}(2)^\frac12 =0.1827262477...$ is the optimal constant, and $\mathfrak{k}(\gamma)>0$ the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator for the $\gamma$ model, determined in the first paper, (I), on $T_c$ by the authors.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 2 figures, revised version, accepted for publication in J.

| **[Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. II: Dispersive phonons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00532v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied, in which the effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by generally dispersive phonons, with Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)\geq 0$ that is $\propto\omega^2$ for small $\omega>0$ and vanishes for large $\omega$. The Eliashberg function also defines the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda:= 2 \int_0^\infty\frac{\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega$. Setting $\frac{2\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega =: \lambda P(d\omega)$, formally defining a probability measure $P(d\omega)$ with compact support, and assuming as usual that the phase transition between normal and superconductivity coincides with the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, it is shown that $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ is a graph of a function $\Lambda(P,T)$ that is determined by a variational principle: if $(\lambda,P,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{k}(P,T)$, where $\mathfrak{k}(P,T)>0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences constructed in the paper. Given $P$, sufficient conditions on $T$ are stated under which the map $T\mapsto \lambda = \Lambda(P,T)$ is invertible. For sufficiently large $\lambda$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ as function of $\lambda$ and $P$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $T_c(\lambda,P)$ that converges to $T_c(\lambda,P)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,P)$. It agrees with the asymptotic form $T_c(\lambda,P) \sim C \sqrt{\langle \omega^2\rangle} \sqrt{\lambda}$ valid for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $P$, though with a constant $C$ that is a factor $\approx 2.034$ larger than the sharp constant. Here, $\langle\omega^2\rangle := \int_0^\infty \omega^2 P(d\omega)$.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 2 figures, revised and corrected version (in particular, the proof of Prop.4 has been corrected); accepted for publication in J.

I: The $γ$-model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00533v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using the recent reformulation for the Eliashberg theory of superconductivity in terms of a classical interacting Bloch spin chain model, rigorous upper and lower bounds on the critical temperature $T_c$ are obtained for the $\gamma$ model -- a version of Eliashberg theory in which the effective electron-electron interaction is proportional to $(g/|\omega_n-\omega_m|)^{\gamma}$, where $\omega_n-\omega_m$ is the transferred Matsubara frequency, $g>0$ a reference energy, and $\gamma>0$ a parameter. The rigorous lower bounds are based on a variational principle that identifies $(T_c/g)^\gamma$ with the largest (positive) eigenvalue of an explicitly constructed compact, self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{G}(\gamma)$. These lower bounds form an increasing sequence that converges to $T_c(g,\gamma)$. The upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$ is based on fixed point theory, proving linear stability of the normal state for $T$ larger than the upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 2 figures, revised preprint version; appeared with different layout in J.

| **[What Really Drives Thermopower: Specific Heat or Entropy as the Unifying Principle Across Magnetic, Superconducting, and Nanoscale Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06745v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermopower, a key parameter in thermoelectric performance, is often linked to either specific heat or entropy, yet the fundamental quantity that governs it has remained elusive. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework that identifies entropy per carrier, not specific heat, as the universal driver of thermopower across both closed and open systems. Using thermodynamic identities and the Onsager-Kelvin relation, we show that thermopower is universally proportional to entropy per carrier, while its apparent proportionality to specific heat arises only in systems where the specific heat follows a continuous power-law temperature dependence. To extend this framework to magnetic systems, we derive a general expression for magnon-drag thermopower that holds in both Newtonian (massive, parabolic) and relativistic (massless, linear) magnon regimes. In particular, we reformulate the momentum balance using a relativistic energy-momentum tensor, resolving conceptual inconsistencies in prior models that relied on ill-defined magnon masses in antiferromagnets. Our framework is further illustrated through three representative systems: (i) magnetic materials, where magnon and paramagnon entropy sustain thermopower across TC and TN; (ii) superconducting Nb, where anomalous thermopower emerges from entropy carried by Bogoliubov quasiparticles near TC; and (iii) a single-molecule junction, where entropy from occupation-number fluctuations governs thermopower in an open quantum system. We validate our unifying principle by comparing it with experimental data: thermopower measurements of superconducting niobium reveal the role of quasiparticle entropy near the critical temperature, and literature-reported specific heat data from a wide range of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials demonstrate consistent entropy-based scaling across magnetic transitions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Coexistence of $p$-wave magnetism and superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14245v3)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The symmetry requirements for realizing unconventional compensated magnets with spin-polarized bands such as altermagnets have recently been uncovered. The most recent addition to this family of magnets is parity-odd or $p$-wave magnets. We demonstrate that $p$-wave magnets are perfectly compatible with superconductivity due to the spin polarization of their electron bands and that they induce unexpected spin transport phenomena. We first show that $p$-wave magnetism can coexist with conventional superconductivity regardless of the magnitude of the spin splitting. We then predict that $p$-wave magnets induce a charge-to-spin conversion, which can be strongly enhanced by the presence of superconductivity providing a way to probe the coexistence in experiments. Our results open an avenue for material combinations with a synergetic relation between spintronics and superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+20 ...</summary><p>6+20 pages, 3+12 figures; close to published version</p></details> |

Here, we integrated the high-precision angle-resolved resistivity (ARR) measurement with a rotatable in-plane magnetic field to systematically study the angular dependence of superconducting fluctuations in optimally doped La1.84Sr0.16CuO4 (LSCO). By independently controlling the directions of the current and the magnetic field, we are able to isolate the magneto-resistivity contributed by the superconducting vortex motion and distinguish excitations from nematic superconductivity and d-wave superconductive order based on their respective C2 and C4 symmetries. Signatures of two intertwined superconductive orders are also evident in the measured angular dependence of the critical current. A T-B phase diagram of different types of superconducting fluctuations is determined. These findings are closely related to other intriguing phenomena, such as pair density wave and charge density wave.</p></details> |  |
| **[Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) (HTSC) in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with critical temperature $T_c$ higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has aroused a surge in the exploration of HTSC in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase multilayer nickelates. Very recently, SC is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ substrate with $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40\text{ K}$) at ambient pressure (AP), allowing various experimental investigation on the pairing mechanism in this material. It is now eager to enhance the $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Here we propose that an imposed strong perpendicular electric field can strongly enhance the $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. The physics underlying this proposal is clear and simple. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this layer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly enhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study and comprehensive two-orbital one under the mean-field treatment and the density matrix renormalization group approach consistently verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers is enough to realize HTSC with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p></details> |  |

| **[Axionic nonreciprocal superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05550v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In nonreciprocal superconductors, inversion and time-reversal symmetries are absent, which may be broken extrinsically or spontaneously. Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts a nonreciprocal superconducting state of the axionic subtype, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide an experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

The paper is devoted to the reduced version of this task in which one only computes the real quantities called singular values. It is shown that in such an approach (and under suitable constraints including the tridiagonality of the Hamiltdonian) the singular values can be sought as poles of an auxiliary Green's function expressible in terms of a doublet of matrix continued fractions. A family of multi-bosonic Bose-Hubbard-like complex Hamiltonians is recalled for illustration purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pp...</summary><p>31 pp., 3 pictures, all pictures and misprints in Eq.

| **[Bose-Hubbard Model on a Honeycomb Superlattice: Quantum Phase Transitions and Lattice Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06984v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model on a honeycomb superlattice. The interplay between the superlattice potential depth $\Delta/t$ and the onsite interaction $U/t$ gives rise to three distinct quantum phases at zero temperature: a superfluid phase, a Mott insulator I phase with unit filling on each site, and a Mott insulator II phase characterized by density imbalance-double occupancy on one sublattice and vacancy on the other at unit filling. The SF-MI transitions are found to be continuous, consistent with second-order quantum phase transitions. We further extend our analysis to finite temperatures within the superfluid regime. Our work highlights how a honeycomb superlattice geometry enables access to interaction- and lattice-modulation-driven quantum phases, including a density-imbalanced Mott insulator and a robust superfluid regime, offering concrete theoretical predictions for cold-atom experiments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18639v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 20 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.04740</p></details> |

| **[Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05031v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

This method extends a previously developed approach for the SU(N) Heisenberg model and relies on the systematic use of the semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT) basis in a DMRG algorithm `a la White. Specifically, the method aligns the site-by-site growth process of the infinite-size part of the DMRG, in its original formulation, with the site-by-site construction of the SSYT (or Gelfand-like) basis, based on the chain of unitary subgroups $U(1)\subset U(2) \subset U(3) \subset U(4)\cdots $. We give special emphasis to the calculation of the symmetry-resolved reduced matrix elements of the hopping terms between the left and the right block, which makes direct use of the basis of SSYT and of the Gelfand-Tsetlin coefficients, offering a computational advantage in scaling with N compared to alternative methods that rely on summing over Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Focusing on the model with homogeneous hopping between nearest neighbors, we have calculated the ground state energy as a function of U, i.e the atom-atom interaction amplitude, up to N=6 for filling 1/N (one particle per site in average), and for one atom (resp. hole) away from filling 1/N, alllowing us to compute the charge gaps, and to estimate in the thermodynamical limit, the critical value $U_c$, separating the Mott insulator from the metallic phase. Central charges c are extracted from the entanglement entropy using the Calabrese-Cardy formula, and are consistent with the theoretical predictions: c=N-1, expected from the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten CFTs in the spin sector for the Mott phase, and c=N in the metallic phase, reflecting the presence of one additional (charge) gapless critical mode.</p></details> | Published version |

Spectral and geometrical properties are used to structurally simplify the contributions and reduce computational effort without sacrificing accuracy. For this, a guide for the computation of the individual perturbational orders up to order nine is provided, alongside a both system-specific and parametrization-dependent convergence criterion. The simplification scheme described is found to be applicable to a wider class of Bose-Hubbard systems with different lattice geometries. An exemplary validation of these findings is included in the form of explicit calculations of ground state energies of the three-site Bose-Hubbard system with repulsive on-site interactions.

Math. Phys. 9, 1327 (1968)] analytically solved long ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the physical parameters of the SU(N) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and eigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. In this context, the connection with the well-studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves as a guideline to the prediction of some N-body physics phenomena in the two-site SU(N) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the SU(N) FHM for an attractive density-density interaction U equal to U_c=-1/(2N), in units of the (absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the finite-size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy, which all reveal the transition, as a function of U for values of N from N = 3 to N = 36, suggesting that the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies involving SU(N) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement entropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like N at the transition, in contrast with several two-mode models.</p></details> | Published Version |

We show that twisted square lattice homo-bilayers generically offer such tunability when the flat bands originate from the corner of the Brillouin zone. We reveal an emergent symmetry at low twist-angles, absent in single layers, that necessitates the vanishing of nearest neighbor hopping ($t=0$). This symmetry can be lifted by an inter-layer displacement field or by an in-plane magnetic field, introducing tunable $t$ and anisotropy, allowing access to a wide range of $t'/t$ ratios for correlated electrons on a moir\'e square lattice.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + End Matter + Supplementary</p></details> |

By employing the iterative generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA) within a time-linear framework, we avoid the computational cost of solving the full two-time Kadanoff-Baym equations. Spectral information is extracted by coupling the system to multiple narrow-band leads, establishing a direct analogy to photoemission experiments. Our results reveal correlation-induced shifts and broadenings of spectral features, along with a suppression of transient current oscillations. This approach provides a promising avenue for analyzing correlated electron dynamics in open quantum systems.</p></details> |  |

For a Hamiltonian \(H\) of such a model, we provide the condition on its parameters under which the \(\eta\)-pairing method can be employed to construct its exact eigenstates. We arrive at this condition by finding that the requirement for the \(\eta\)-pairing state \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\) to be an eigenstate of \(H\) is identical to the requirement for it to be an eigenstate of a Hubbard-type Hamiltonian \(H_m\). When the condition for \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\) to be an eigenstate of the Hubbard-type Hamiltonian \(H_m\) is satisfied, we demonstrate that there are additional states, distinct from \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\), which are also exact eigenstates of \(H_m\). Our results enhance the understanding of Hubbard models on general graphs, both with and without bond-charge interactions.</p></details> | 5 pages, 0 figures |

We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.</p></details> |  |

The stiffnesses are computed from the spin susceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically ordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a moderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a N\'eel antiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a planar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon electron doping, the N\'eel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply. By contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop abruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and then increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite temperatures, the N\'eel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped regime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they vanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe the quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero upon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the quantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains N\'eel ordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range order in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with a spin gap.</p></details> |  |

We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

The system is investigated under the competing effects of thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and a disorder term. We compute several observables, including the condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of quantum coherence, to characterize the transition from the Mott insulator to the superfluid phase. In the standard Bose-Hubbard model, ground-state properties exhibit signatures of a quantum phase transition under open boundary conditions. While finite-size effects preclude an exact realization of the thermodynamic transition, our findings serve as indicators of the underlying quantum critical behavior of the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. At finite temperatures, this critical point shifts to a smooth crossover, reflecting the suppression of long-range coherence typical of larger systems. A nonzero Stark potential delays this crossover, promoting localization and the formation of non-superfluid condensates. In contrast, thermal fluctuations can induce unexpected coherence through fluctuation-driven tunneling. Disorder disrupts superfluidity but preserves local coherence, with thermal states exhibiting an enhanced $\ell_1$-norm of coherence within the Bose glass regime. Our results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature jointly reshape the coherence landscape, and offer valuable insights for quantum simulation and the characterization of quantum phases in strongly correlated systems. Non-ergodic behavior is observed in the clean system where the mean gap ratio stays below Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) values. With a Stark potential, level statistics shift from Poisson-like to near-GOE as tunneling increases, which indicates a crossover to semi-ergodic dynamics.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) (HTSC) in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with critical temperature $T_c$ higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has aroused a surge in the exploration of HTSC in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase multilayer nickelates. Very recently, SC is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ substrate with $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40\text{ K}$) at ambient pressure (AP), allowing various experimental investigation on the pairing mechanism in this material. It is now eager to enhance the $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Here we propose that an imposed strong perpendicular electric field can strongly enhance the $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. The physics underlying this proposal is clear and simple. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this layer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly enhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study and comprehensive two-orbital one under the mean-field treatment and the density matrix renormalization group approach consistently verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers is enough to realize HTSC with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p></details> |  |

More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors.

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures and appendix</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K under I4/mmm space group. The susceptibility measurements confirm bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Our research provides a new platform for the investigation of the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in Ruddlesden-Popper trilayer perovskite nickelates.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity. Our findings indicate that interlayer Coulomb interactions are crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

However, current ab initio approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe$_2$, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s-4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Harnessing their full potential requires understanding both intrinsic transport and the dynamics of optically excited spin and charge carriers -- particularly the transition between excited spin polarization and the conduction band's intrinsic spin texture. Here, we investigate the spin polarization of the conduction bands of bulk WSe$_2$ using static and time-resolved spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, complemented by photocurrent calculations. Electron doping reveals the intrinsic spin polarization, while time-resolved measurements trace the evolution of excited spin carriers. We find that intervalley scattering is spin-conserving, with spin transport initially governed by photoexcited carriers and aligning with the intrinsic conduction band polarization after $\sim$150 fs.</p></details> |  |

This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures.

We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03361v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

Here, we demonstrate that exposing WSe$_2$ to chloroform provides simple and stable p-type doping. In monolayer WSe$_2$ transistors with Pd contacts, chloroform increases the maximum hole current by over 100$\times$ (>200 $\mu$A/$\mu$m), reduces $R_\textrm{C}$ to ~2.5 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m, and retains an on/off ratio of $10^{10}$ at room temperature. These improvements persist for over 8 months, survive annealing above 150 {\deg}C, and remain effective down to 10 K, enabling a cryogenic $R_\textrm{C}$ of ~1 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Density functional theory indicates that chloroform strongly physisorbs to WSe$_2$, inducing hole doping with minimal impact on the electronic states between the valence band and conduction band edges. Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy reveal that chloroform intercalates at the WSe$_2$ interface with the gate oxide, contributing to doping stability and mitigating interfacial dielectric disorder. This robust, scalable approach enables high-yield WSe$_2$ transistors with good p-type performance.</p></details> |  |

However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Accompanying the superconductivity and a correlated insulator phase is the Kondo-lattice-like phenomenology in transport properties. Here we consider how such phenomenology can develop when the combination of the active bands are topological. We advance a unique construction of compact molecular orbitals through a partial Wannierization that is symmetry preserving. The resulting Anderson lattice model provides the basis for a microscopic understanding of the experimental observation, including the involved energy scales.

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11763v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band's natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters; 7 + 9 pages, 4 + 6 figures</p></details> |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

By achieving low and uniform carrier densities, we have accessed a new regime of strong charge localization that dramatically reduces thermal conductance, significantly enhancing bolometer performance. Here we present scalable graphene-based bolometers engineered for detecting GHz-range photons, a frequency domain essential for superconducting quantum processors. Our devices deliver a state-of-the-art noise equivalent power of 40 zW$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at $T=40~$mK, enabled by the steep temperature dependence of thermal conductance, $G_{\rm th}\sim T^4$ for $T<100~$mK. These results establish epitaxial graphene bolometers as versatile and low-back-action detectors, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation quantum processors and pioneering investigations into the thermodynamics and thermalization pathways of strongly entangled quantum systems.</p></details> |  |

We show the importance of many-body effects on electronic excitations at finite transferred momentum by comparing measured EELS with ab initio calculations at increasing levels of theory. Quasi-particle corrections and excitonic effects are addressed within the GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation, respectively. Both effects are essential in the description of the EEL spectra to obtain a quantitative agreement with experiments, with the position, dispersion, and shape of both the excitation gap and the $\pi$ plasmon being significantly affected by excitonic effects.</p></details> |  |

This work examines Si intercalation of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) using three preparation methods. Dangling bond states at the interface were found to undergo a Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition as a result of a significant on-site repulsion. Comparing this heterostructure consisting of graphene and a Mott insulator with a similar system without graphene, reveals the screening ability of graphene's conduction electrons on the on-site repulsion. The system presented here can serve as a template for further research on Mott insulators with variable band gap.</p></details> |  |

However, direct electrical measurements of GNIs have been challenging due to the requirement of metal catalysts in typical synthesis methods. In this study, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of GNIs by using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition, which is a catalyst-free method to deposit graphene directly on SiO$_2$ substrates. This approach enables the fabrication of metal electrodes on GNIs, allowing us to measure their quantum transport properties. At low temperatures, one of our devices shows clear Coulomb diamonds with twofold degeneracy, indicating the formation of quantum dots and the vanishing of valley degeneracy. The charge state of the GNI is also modulated by a local side gate, and the tunneling coupling between leads and quantum dots is modulated by changing contact area and metal materials. These results provide device design guidelines toward GNI-based quantum devices for next-generation computing.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

We present a theoretical investigation of non-equilibrium thermal dynamics in graphene under femtosecond laser excitation, emphasizing the role of phonon branch-resolved electron phonon coupling. This framework provides new insight into ultrafast energy transfer processes at femtosecond timescales and illustrates key deviations from the predictions of the classical two temperature model (TTM), particularly in spatially localized heat transport. Our results show that a 190 fs laser pulse induces a strong non-equilibrium state, followed by momentum redistribution among the excited carriers. This is then followed by effective cooling of the carrier distribution on a 450 fs timescale through phonon emission.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version submitted to Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics (manuscript ID: JPhysD-139850.R1)</p></details> |

In 2d and at long wavelengths, they couple to light and act as the system polaritons. They also dictate the scattering of charged carriers. Van der Waals heterostructures offer the opportunity to couple excitations from different layers via long-range Coulomb interactions, modifying both their dispersion and their scattering of electrons. Even when the excitations do not couple, they are still influenced by the screening from all layers, leading to complex dynamical interactions between electrons, plasmons and polar phonons. We develop an efficient ab initio model to solve the dynamical electric response of Van der Waals heterostructures, accompanied by a formalism to extract relevant spectroscopic and transport quantities. Notably, we obtain scattering rates for electrons of the heterostructure coupling remotely with electrodynamic excitations. We apply those developments to BN-capped graphene, in which polar phonons from BN couple to plasmons in graphene. We study the nature of the coupled excitations, their dispersion and their coupling to graphene's electrons. Regimes driven by either phonons or plasmons are identified, as well as a truly hybrid regime at long wavelengths. Those are studied as a function of the graphene's Fermi level and the number of BN layers. In contrast with descriptions in terms of surface-optical phonons, we find that the electron-phonon interaction stems from different modes. Moreover, the dynamical screening of the coupling between BN's LO phonons and graphene's electrons crosses over from inefficient to metal-like depending on the relative value of the phonons' frequency and the energetic onset of interband transitions. While the coupling is significant in general, the associated scattering of graphene's carriers is found to be negligible in the context of electronic transport.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 18 figures.

Comparing with fully \textit{ab initio} theoretical calculations, we conclude that the observation is explained by an enhanced, momentum-dependent coupling between electrons and Brillouin zone-boundary optical phonons.

| **[New classes of quantum anomalous Hall crystals in multilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04174v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent experimental observation of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effects in the rhombohedrally stacked pentalayer graphene has motivated theoretical discussions on the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC), a topological version of Wigner crystal. Conventional topological Wigner crystals typically have one electron per unit cell. In this work we propose new types of topological Wigner crystals labeled as QAHC-$z$, with $z$ electrons per unit cell. In the pentalayer graphene system, we find parameter regimes where QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 have lower energy than the conventional QAHC-1 at total filling $\nu=1$ per moir\'e unit cell. These states all have total Chern number $C_\mathrm{tot}=1$ and are consistent with the QAH effect observed in the experiments. The larger period QAHC states have lower kinetic energy due to the unique Mexican-hat dispersion of the pentalayer graphene, which can compensate for the loss in the interaction energy. Unlike QAHC-1, QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 break the moir\'e translation symmetry and are sharply distinct from a moir\'e band insulator. We also briefly discuss the competition between integer QAH and fractional QAH states at filling $\nu=2/3$. Moreover, we find that a stronger moir\'e potential can significantly change the phase diagram and even favors a QAHC-1 ansatz with $C=2$ Chern band.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

Lead iodide (PbI2), a 2D layered semiconductor material belonging to the metal halide family, shows a thickness-dependent band gap with an indirect-to-direct transition above one monolayer. It has emerged as an excellent candidate for photodetectors and is a key component in metal halide perovskites solar cells. In the current work, we investigated the growth dynamics and the real-time correlation between structural and optical properties of PbI2 layers deposited on graphene/SiC(0001) by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. The structural and optical properties are probed respectively by Grazing Incidence Fast Atom Diffraction and Surface Differential Reflectance Spectroscopy. The growth proceeds layer-by-layer in a van der Waals-like epitaxy, with the zigzag direction of PbI2 parallel to the armchair direction of graphene. Both techniques bring evidence of significant modifications of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the first PbI2 monolayer, characterized by a 1% tensile strain that relaxes over 3 to 5 monolayers. For a single monolayer, Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy reveals a charge transfer from graphene to PbI2, demonstrated by an energy shift of the order of 50 meV in the graphene band structure.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional optical techniques have struggled to integrate the necessary components for transferring polariton signals. Here, we address this challenge by electrically generating, manipulating, and reading out terahertz graphene plasmon-polariton wavepackets on-chip. By injecting an electrical pulse into graphene via an ohmic contact, we achieve coherent conversion of the pulse into a plasmon wavepacket exhibiting a pulse duration of 1.2 ps and extreme three-dimensional spatial confinement within a volume of $2.1 \times 10^{-18} m^3$. We reveal the transport properties of plasmons along graphene ribbons in different dielectric environments, providing a basis for designing graphene plasmonic circuits. Furthermore, we find that the conversion efficiency between the electrical pulses and plasmon wavepackets reaches ~30% thanks to the absence of a momentum mismatch. With unprecedented controllability, our platform represents a significant advance in on-chip handling of plasmonic signals in various van der Waals heterostructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, Supplementary information</p></details> |

However, revealing its mechanism and intrinsic time scale require uncharted terahertz (THz) electronics and device architectures. Here, we succeeded in resolving O-E conversion processes in high-quality graphene by on-chip electrical readout of ultrafast photothermoelectric current. By suppressing the RC time constant using a resistive zinc oxide top gate, we constructed a gate-tunable graphene photodetector with a bandwidth of up to 220 GHz. By measuring nonlocal photocurrent dynamics, we found that the photocurrent extraction from the electrode is instantaneous without a measurable carrier transit time across several-micrometer-long graphene, following the Shockley-Ramo theorem. The time for photocurrent generation is exceptionally tunable from immediate to > 4 ps, and its origin is identified as Fermi-level-dependent intraband carrier-carrier scattering.

Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.03139</p></details> |

We apply the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of two graphene layers twisted with respect to each other by a small angle. By reducing the model to the Dirac-type one with modified Fermi velocity, we derive expressions for the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin interactions using perturbation theory for the free energy. The biquadratic interaction is suppressed by a larger power of the interaction constant and decreases faster with a the distance between impurities comparing to the quadratic one. Nevertheless, due to the different period of oscillations with impurity separation distance, chemical potential, twist angle and temperature, it is possible to fine-tune the system to the regime of dominating biquadratic interaction. The existence of such fine-tuned regime might provide a promising opportunity to observe non-conventional spin ordering.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, their origin, stability, and reproducibility remain under debate. Here, we present charge transport experiments in dual-gated, dynamically rotatable van der Waals heterostructures based on bilayer graphene encapsulated in BN. Remarkably, the angular degree of freedom acts as an ON/OFF switch for the anomalous gating response. We show that the angular alignment between the two BN layers -- not the presence of a moir\'e superlattice with graphene -- is the key parameter governing these effects. The relevant alignment between the two BN layers, to observe the anomalous gating effect at room temperature, lies between 15 deg and 45 deg, with no evidence of the expected 60 deg periodicity. Both gate ineffectiveness and hysteresis are highly sensitive to small angular changes, which we classify into three distinct regimes. Our results clarify the conditions necessary to reproduce these phenomena and pave the way for theoretical investigation of their microscopic origins.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

It is predicted that NPG may, despite its molecular structure, work as electron waveguides that display e.g. Talbot wave interference. Here, we demonstrate how the electronic wave guidance may be controlled by the use of electrical fields transverse to the ribbons; at low fields, point injected currents display spatially periodic patterns along the ribbons, while high fields localize the injected current to single ribbons. This behavior constitutes an electronic version of optical breathing modes of Bloch oscillations, providing a simple mechanism for controlling the current patterns down to the molecular scale. The robustness of the self-repeating patterns under disorder demonstrate that the breathing modes of single-ribbon injections offer exciting opportunities for applications in nanoelectronics, molecular sensing, and quantum information processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gate-tunable spectrum and charge dispersion mitigation in a graphene superconducting qubit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04959v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling the energy spectrum of quantum-coherent superconducting circuits, i.e. the energies of excited states, the circuit anharmonicity and the states' charge dispersion, is essential for designing performant qubits. This control is usually achieved by adjusting the circuit's geometry. In-situ control is traditionally obtained via an external magnetic field, in the case of tunnel Josephson junctions. More recently, semiconductor-weak-links-based Josephson junctions have emerged as an alternative building block with the advantage of tunability via the electric-field effect. Gate-tunable Josephson junctions have been succesfully integrated in superconducting circuits using for instance semiconducting nanowires or two-dimensional electron gases. In this work we demonstrate, in a graphene superconducting circuit, a large gate-tunability of qubit properties: frequency, anharmonicity and charge dispersion. We rationalize these features using a model considering the transmission of Cooper pairs through Andreev bound states. Noticeably, we show that the high transmission of Cooper pairs in such weak link strongly suppresses the charge dispersion. Our work illustrates the potential for graphene-based qubits as versatile building-blocks in advanced quantum circuits.</p></details> |  |

The time propagation of the wave packets are calculated using the split-operator method for different size, height and separation of the barriers. The time propagation of the wave packets is calculated using the split-operator method for various barrier sizes, heights, and separations. We found that, despite the pronounced Klein tunneling effect in graphene, the presence of a lattice of defects significantly impacts the propagation properties of the wave packets. For example, depending on the height and size of the incident wave packet, the transmission probability can decrease by more than 20\%. The alteration of the polarity of the potential barriers also contributes to the transmission probabilities of the wave packet in graphene. The obtained results could provide valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of charge carrier dynamics in graphene-based nanodevices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exceptional magic angles in non-Hermitian twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08804v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) features strongly correlated and topological phases due to its flat bands emerging near the magic angle. However, the effects of the non-Hermiticity, arising from the coupling to the environment and dissipation, have remained unexplored. We here develop a simple non-Hermitian (NH) version of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) by considering relative twisting of two NH graphene monolayers with non-Hermiticity encoded in the imbalance of in-plane nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes. Remarkably, by generalizing the Bistritzer-MacDonald approach to NH systems, we discover exceptional magic angles where the band structure changes from purely real to purely imaginary thus featuring flat bands with infinite lifetime. Between them, the bands remain flattened, and a Hermitian magic angle emerges at which the imaginary part of energy is maximal, and corresponds to the usual magic angle in non-dissipative, purely Hermitian TBG. We propose an optical lattice setup with gain and loss where our theoretical predictions can be verified. These results suggest the robustness of the flat bands in open systems, paving the way for the further studies on the interplay of dissipative effects, electronic topology, and interactions in such NH moir\'e bands.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, published version</p></details> |

A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages main text + 7 pages Appendix and References; 7 + 2 figures</p></details> |

This {entanglement barrier} restricts classical simulations and, conversely, underpins the quantum advantage anticipated from future devices. Here we show that, for one-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the spatio-temporal tensor network encoding the evolved wave function amplitudes can be contracted efficiently along the left-right (spatial) direction. Exploiting this structure, we develop a hybrid Tensor-Network/Monte-Carlo (TN-MC) algorithm that samples the wave function and evaluates expectation values of generic local operators with computational cost that scales only polynomially in time. The accurate contraction of the wave function amplitudes is a consequence of the favorable scaling with time of the generalised temporal entropies. We find that their real part either saturates or, at most, grows logarithmically with time, revealing new instances of continuous dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) which we characterize. Our results therefore show that, when computing expectation values of local operators, the entanglement barrier in one-dimensional Hamiltonian evolution can be bypassed with a TN-MC blend.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures. v2: extended discussion and improved presentation</p></details> |

By encoding bulk information into highly entangled boundary degrees of freedom, they capture key features of holography such as subregion duality, operator reconstruction, and complementary recovery. Among them, hyperinvariant tensor networks-characterized by the inclusion of edge tensors and the enforcement of multi-tensor isometries-offer a promising platform for realizing features such as state dependence and nontrivial boundary correlations. However, existing constructions are largely confined to two-dimensional regular tilings, and the structural principles underlying hyperinvariance remain poorly understood, especially in higher dimensions. To address this, we introduce a geometric criterion called angular k-uniformity, which refines standard k-uniformity and its planar variants by requiring isometric behavior within angular sectors of a tensor's rotationally symmetric layout. This condition enables the systematic identification and construction of hyperinvariant holographic codes on regular hyperbolic honeycombs in arbitrary dimension, and extends naturally to heterogeneous networks and qLEGO architectures beyond regular tilings. Altogether, angular k-uniformity provides a versatile, geometry-aware framework for analyzing and designing holographic tensor networks and codes with hyperinvariant features such as nontrivial boundary correlations and state-dependent complementary recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 32 pages, 11 figures.

We provide evidence that the generalized model interpolating between these two lattices features an extended quantum spin liquid ground state, which is gapless on the ruby lattice and gapped on the maple-leaf lattice, with the transition between the two occurring midway. We present equal-time spin structure factors which further characterize the nature of the presumed quantum spin liquid. Our results are based on one of the most extensive state-of-the-art variational infinite tensor network calculations to date, thereby helping us to resolve the long-standing issue of the delicate competition between magnetically ordered and paramagnetic states in this family of models.</p></details> |  |

These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages + appendices, 20 figures</p></details> |

Here, we establish a method to compute local topological invariants of exceptionally large systems using tensor networks, enabling the computation of invariants for Hamiltonians with hundreds of millions of sites, several orders of magnitude above the capabilities of conventional methodologies. Our approach leverages a tensor-network representation of the density matrix using a Chebyshev tensor network algorithm, enabling large-scale calculations of topological markers in quasicrystalline and moire systems. We demonstrate our methodology with two-dimensional quasicrystals featuring 8-fold and 10-fold rotational symmetries and mosaics of Chern phases. Our work establishes a powerful method to compute topological phases in exceptionally large-scale topological systems, establishing the required tool to rationalize generic super-moire and quasicrystalline topological matter.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Hybrid between biologically inspired and quantum inspired many-body states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05050v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks can represent very different sorts of functions, including complex quantum many-body states. Tensor networks can also represent these states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can be prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions. Here, we propose a generalization of the perceptron - the perceptrain - which borrows features from the two different formalisms. We construct variational many-body ansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as a neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks. These include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix renormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once; the possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the optimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a structure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a combination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo (GFMC) on a $10\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long range $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the Rydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing. We consistently find a very high relative accuracy for the ground state energy, around $10^{-5}$ for VMC and $10^{-6}$ for GFMC in all regimes of parameters, including in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition. We used very small ranks ($\sim 2-5$) of perceptrains, as opposed to multiples of thousand used in matrix product states. The optimization of the energy was robust with respect to the choice of initial conditions and hyper-parameters, in contrast to a common experience when using neural network wave functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01699v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose a new method for constrained combinatorial optimization using tensor networks. Combinatorial optimization methods employing quantum gates, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm, have been intensively investigated. However, their limitations in errors and the number of qubits prevent them from handling large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Alternatively, attempts have been made to solve larger-scale problems using tensor networks that can approximately simulate quantum states. In recent years, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. For the principle verification of the proposed method, we constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem and conducted imaginary time evolution. We found that feasible solutions were obtained during the evolution, ultimately leading to the optimal solution. The proposed method is expected to facilitate the discovery of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Exponential distillation of dominant eigenproperties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04380v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating observable expectation values in eigenstates of quantum systems has a broad range of applications and is an area where early fault-tolerant quantum computers may provide practical quantum advantage. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that enables the estimation of an arbitrary observable expectation value in an eigenstate, given an initial state is supplied that has dominant overlap with the targeted eigenstate -- but may overlap with any other eigenstates. Our approach builds on, and is conceptually similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then virtually purified with exponential efficacy. We prove rigorous performance guarantees and conclude that the complexity of our approach depends directly on the energy gap in the problem Hamiltonian, and is thus comparable to state-of-the-art hybrid techniques. We demonstrate in a broad range of numerical simulations the applicability of our framework in near-term and early fault-tolerant settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a 100-qubit example that direct classical simulation of our approach enables the prediction of ground and excited state properties of quantum systems using tensor network techniques, which we recognize as a quantum-inspired classical approach.</p></details> | 22 pages, 15 figures |

| **[Computational Complexity of Non-Hermitian Quantum Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03435v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the computational power of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics, i.e., conditional time evolutions that arise when a quantum system is monitored and one postselects on a particular measurement record. We establish an approximate equivalence between post-selection and arbitrary non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Namely, first we establish hardness in the following sense: Let $U=e^{-iHt}$ be an NH gate on $n$ qubits whose smallest and largest singular values differ by at least $2^{-\text{poly}(n)}$. Together with any universal set of unitary gates, the ability to apply such a gate lets one efficiently emulate postselection. The resulting model decides every language in PostBQP; hence, under standard complexity conjectures, fully scalable NH quantum computers are unlikely to be engineered. Second, we establish upper bounds which show that conversely, any non-Hermitian evolution can be written as a unitary on a system-meter pair followed by postselecting the meter. This ``purification'' is compact -- it introduces only $O(\delta^{2})$ Trotter error per time step $\delta$ -- so any NH model whose purification lies in a strongly simulable unitary family (e.g., Clifford, matchgate, or low-bond-dimension tensor-network circuits) remains efficiently simulable. Thus, non-Hermitian physics neither guarantees a quantum advantage nor precludes efficient classical simulation: its complexity is controlled by the singular-value radius of the evolution operator and by the structure of its unitary purification.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 + ...</summary><p>11 + 3 pages, comments welcome</p></details> |

Here, we develop a theory for the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) response of altermagnetic Mott insulators. Crucially, the spectrum does not simply reflect the non-interacting band structure, but instead a magnetic polaron is formed at low energies, that can be interpreted as a spinon-holon bound state. We develop a spinon-holon parton theory and predict a renormalized bandwidth that we confirm by tensor network simulations. We analyze the characteristic spin-split spectrum and identify a spin-dependent spectral weight of the magnetic polaron, resulting from the altermagnetic symmetry. Our work paves the way for a systematic study of doping effects and correlation phenomena in altermagnetic Mott insulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

Here, we construct a realistic moir\'e lattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and filling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized Wigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moir\'e unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+11...</summary><p>12+11 pages, 6+10 figures</p></details> |

Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures.

While tensor networks are natural competitors to quantum computers, we instead leverage them to support circuit design, with datasets of tensor networks enabling a unitary synthesis inspired by quantum machine learning. For a target simulation in the thermodynamic limit, translation invariance is exploited to significantly reduce the optimization complexity, avoiding a scaling with system size. Our approach finds circuits to efficiently prepare ground states, and perform time evolution on both infinite and finite systems with substantially lower gate depths than conventional Trotterized methods. In addition to reducing CNOT depths, we motivate similar utility for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, with a demonstrated $5.2\times$ reduction in $T$-count to realize $e^{-iHt}$. The key output of our approach is the optimized unit-cell of a translation invariant circuit. This provides an advantage for Hamiltonian simulation of finite, yet arbitrarily large, systems on real quantum computers.</p></details> |  |

In this letter, a 2D lattice system interacting only between two nearest neighboring sites is proposed, which has a unique ground state with volume scaling of entanglement entropy. The system undergoes an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous construction from coupling orthogonal arrays of one-dimensional chains, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. A tensor network representation is composed of tensors with lower rank, and has a similar global geometry.</p></details> |  |

In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</p></details> | <details><summary>25+13...</summary><p>25+13 pages, 5 tables, 6 figures, data in ancillary files</p></details> |

We apply this simulation to a near-optimized iteration of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a transverse field Ising model in order to investigate the influence of large system sizes on the performance of the algorithm. We find that while circuits with a large number of qubits fail more often under noise that depletes the qubit population, their outputs on a successful measurement are just as robust under Rydberg atom dissipation or qubit dephasing as smaller systems. However, such circuits might not perform as well under coherent multi-qubit errors such as Rydberg atom crosstalk. We also find that the optimized parameters are especially robust to noise, suggesting that a noisier quantum system can be used to find the optimal parameters before switching to a cleaner system for measurements of observables.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

| **[Interlayer Pairing in Bilayer Nickelates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07741v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of $T_c\sim 80$~K superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has launched a new platform to study high-temperature superconductivity. Using non-perturbative dynamic cluster approximation quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we characterize the magnetic and superconducting pairing behavior of a realistic bilayer two-orbital Hubbard-Hund model of this system that describes the relevant Ni $e_g$ states with physically relevant interaction strengths. We find a leading $s^\pm$ superconducting instability in this model and show that this state primarily arises from interlayer pairing in the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital that is driven by strong interlayer spin-fluctuations in that orbital. These results provide non-perturbative evidence supporting the picture that a simple single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model for the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital provides an excellent low-energy effective description of the superconducting behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we first investigated the average sign problem in the breathing kagome lattice, which is significantly affected by both the breathing strength and the interaction strength. Secondly, we calculated the electronic kinetic energy, the direct current conductivity, and the electronic density of states at the Fermi level to determine the critical interaction strength for the metal-insulator transition. Our results indicate that the breathing effect, in conjunction with the interaction strength, drives the kagome system from a metal to an insulator. Finally, we evaluated the magnetic properties and constructed a phase diagram incorporating both transport and magnetic properties. The phase diagram reveals that as the interaction strength increases, the system transitions from a paramagnetic metal to a Mott insulator. Our research provides a theoretical guidance for utilizing the breathing effect to control the band gaps, conductivity, and magnetic properties of kagome materials with electronic interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages and 7 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Neural Quantum State based Kernel Polynomial Method for Optical Properties from the First Principle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07430v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational optimization of neural-network quantum state representations has achieved FCI-level accuracy for ground state calculations, yet computing optical properties involving excited states remains challenging. In this work, we present a neural-network-based variational quantum Monte Carlo approach for ab-initio absorption spectra. We leverage parallel batch autoregressive sampling and GPU-supported local energy parallelism to efficiently compute ground states of complex systems. By integrating neural quantum ground states with the kernel polynomial method, our approach accurately calculates absorption spectra for large molecules with over 50 electrons, achieving FCI-level precision. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior scalability and reduced runtime compared to FCI, marking a significant step forward in optical property calculations for large-scale quantum systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A many-body marker for three-dimensional topological insulators with inversion symmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19204v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend the previously defined many-body marker for two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators [I. Gilardoni {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, L161106 (2022)] to distinguish trivial, weak-, and strong-topological insulators in three dimensions, in presence of the inversion symmetry. The marker is written in term of ground-state expectation values of position operators and can be employed to detect topological phases of interacting systems beyond mean-field approximations, e.g., within quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Here, we show that the correct results of the non-interacting limit are reproduced by the many-body marker.</p></details> | 8 pages and 1 figure |
| **[Absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00126v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures; minor changes to V1</p></details> |
| **[Delay Update in determinant quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12005v4)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is a widely used unbiased numerical method for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, the update process in DQMC is often a bottleneck for its efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a generalized delay update scheme that can handle both onsite and extended interactions. Our delay update scheme can be implemented in both zero-temperature and finite-temperature versions of DQMC. We apply the delay update scheme to various strongly correlated electron models and evaluate its efficiency under different conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed delay update scheme significantly improves the efficiency of DQMC simulations, enable it to simulate larger system size.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Multiparty Entanglement Microscopy of Quantum Ising models in 1d, 2d and 3d](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12533v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entanglement microscopy reveals the true quantum correlations among the microscopic building blocks of many-body systems [Nat. Commun. 16, 96 (2025)]. Using this approach, we study the multipartite entanglement of the quantum Ising model in 1d, 2d, and 3d. We first obtain the full reduced density matrix (tomography) of subregions that have at most 4 sites via quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and the exact solution in 1d. We then analyze both bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) among the sites in the subregion. To do so, we use a variety of measures including the negativity, as well as a true measure of GME: the genuinely multipartite concurrence (or GME concurrence), and its computationally cheaper lower bound, $I_2$. We provide a complete proof that $I_2$ bounds the GME concurrence, and show how the symmetries of the state simplify its evaluation. For adjacent sites, we find 3- and 4-spin GME present across large portions of the phase diagram, reaching maximum near the quantum critical point. In 1d, we identify the singular scaling of the derivative $dI_2/dh$ approaching the critical point. We observe a sharp decrease of GME with increasing dimensionality, coherent with the monogamous nature of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that GME disappears for subregions consisting of non-adjacent sites in both 2d and 3d, offering a stark illustration of the short-ranged nature of entanglement in equilibrium quantum matter arXiv:2402.06677. Finally, we analyze the most collective form of entanglement by evaluating the GME concurrence among all spins in the lattice, which can be obtained from a simple observable: the single-site transverse magnetization. This global concurrence is larger in 1d compared to 2d/3d, but it is relatively less robust against perturbations such as local measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+8 ...</summary><p>12+8 pages, 7+7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic structure factor of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with long-range interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15168v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as a ``model selection'' tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</p></details> | 23 pages, 29 figures |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Wavefunctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02171v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based wavefunction ansatz as viable representations for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Through systematic analysis of one-dimensional model systems, we evaluate their computational efficiency and representational power against established methods. Our numerical experiments suggest some efficient training methods and we explore how the computational cost scales with desired precision, particle number, and system parameters. Roughly speaking, KANs seem to be 10 times cheaper computationally than other neural network based ansatz. We also introduce a novel approach for handling strong short-range potentials-a persistent challenge for many numerical techniques-which generalizes efficiently to higher-dimensional, physically relevant systems with short-ranged strong potentials common in atomic and nuclear physics.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Hole clustering and mutual interplay in three-band Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00787v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed remarkable role of a supercell consisting $4\times4$ CuO$_2$ unit cells in the emergence of local nematic state and preformed local Cooper pairs and phase coherent cuprate superconductivity. By employing the numerically exact determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we mimic the effects of experimental Ca vacancy by an external local potential to investigate the charge and spectral properties of the system hosting two doped holes. The model numerically support the role of the $4\times4$ supercell as the building block of hole doped cuprates via the hole density distribution and local spectra around the local potential. Our results might provide a theoretical support on the experimental observations and a platform for investigating local charge order and local Cooper pairs on the $4\times4$ supercell as the plausible route to understanding unconventional cuprate superconductivity.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Variation of Bose surface by Filling in Cooper pair Bose metal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24405v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) is a non-superfluid quantum phase in which uncondensed fermion pairs form a "Bose surface" in momentum space. We investigate the CPBM in the two-dimensional spin-anisotropic attractive Hubbard model by tuning the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping t', carrier filling n, and spin anisotropy alpha, using large-scale constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations. A moderate NNN hopping (t'/t = 0.2) substantially enlarges the CPBM region: the phase extends into weaker anisotropy regimes and coexists with a commensurate charge-density wave (CDW) near half-filling (n > 0.95), where CDW order would otherwise dominate at t' = 0. Interestingly, t' suppresses the overall CDW peak amplitude and introduces a geometric correlation between the orientations of the Fermi and Bose surfaces: for weak Fermi-surface rotations, the Bose surface remains aligned with the lattice axes, while larger distortions drive both surfaces to rotate in tandem. Momentum-resolved pairing distributions reveal that the bosonic pairing channels are jointly controlled by t' and carrier filling n. For small t', d_xy-wave correlations dominate across the entire filling range. In contrast, for larger t', the dominant pairing symmetry varies with n, reflecting a nontrivial interplay between frustration and density. These findings establish carrier filling and NNN hopping as complementary levers for manipulating CPBM stability and provide concrete criteria for identifying non-superfluid bosonic matter in cold-atom and correlated-electron systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures, |
| **[Group Convolutional Neural Network Ground State of the Quantum Dimer Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23728v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We estimate the ground state of the square lattice Quantum Dimer Model in a $\rm{p4m}$-symmetric Group Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) representation and show that results in agreement with exact diagonalization (ED) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can be obtained with a $\mathcal{L}=2$ layer network. In systems of linear size $L=8$ with Hilbert space dimension $3.1\times 10^8$, GCNN shows fidelity as high as $0.99999$ with ED. For $12\leq L\leq 32$, we find excellent agreement with QMC estimates of energy, order parameters and correlation functions. The network is optimized by minimizing the energy estimated from a Metropolis algorithm assisted by a directed loop sampler. We analyze the quantum geometric tensor at the minima for $\mathcal{L}=1,2$ and $3$ and show that the empirical quantum dimension saturates with increasing network complexity due to Metropolis sampling constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dividing quantum circuits for time evolution of stochastic processes by orthogonal series density estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01889v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Monte Carlo integration (QMCI) is a quantum algorithm to estimate expectations of random variables, with applications in various industrial fields such as financial derivative pricing. When QMCI is applied to expectations concerning a stochastic process $X(t)$, e.g., an underlying asset price in derivative pricing, the quantum circuit $U_{X(t)}$ to generate the quantum state encoding the probability density of $X(t)$ can have a large depth. With time discretized into $N$ points, using state preparation oracles for the transition probabilities of $X(t)$, the state preparation for $X(t)$ results in a depth of $O(N)$, which may be problematic for large $N$. Moreover, if we estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ at $N$ time points, the total query complexity scales on $N$ as $O(N^2)$, which is worse than the $O(N)$ complexity in the classical Monte Carlo method. In this paper, to improve this, we propose a method to divide $U_{X(t)}$ based on orthogonal series density estimation. This approach involves approximating the densities of $X(t)$ at $N$ time points with orthogonal series, where the coefficients are estimated as expectations of the orthogonal functions by QMCI. By using these approximated densities, we can estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ by QMCI without requiring deep circuits. Our error and complexity analysis shows that to obtain the approximated densities at $N$ time points, our method achieves the circuit depth and total query complexity scaling as $O(\sqrt{N})$ and $O(N^{3/2})$, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for solving Black-Scholes PDEs for high-dimensional option pricing in finance and its complexity analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09241v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Hamiltonian Problem with succinct ground state is MA-Complete](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10155v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding the ground energy of a quantum system is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. Existing classical algorithms for tackling this problem often assume that the ground state has a succinct classical description, i.e. a poly-size classical circuit for computing the amplitude. Notable examples of succinct states encompass matrix product states, contractible projected entangled pair states, and states that can be represented by classical neural networks. We study the complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem with succinct ground state. We prove this problem is MA-Complete. The Hamiltonian we consider is general and might not be stoquastic. The MA verification protocol is based on the fixed node quantum Monte Carlo method, particularly the variant of the continuous-time Markov chain introduced by Bravyi et.al. [BCGL22]. Based on our work, we also introduce a notion of strong guided states, and conjecture that the local Hamiltonian problem with strong guided state is MA-Complete, which will be in contrast with the QCMA-Complete result of the local Hamiltonian problem with standard guided states [WFC23,GLG22].</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages; correct an error in Sec IV C.

| **[Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Exact solution and Luttinger liquid behavior of the quantum 1D hard rod model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20376v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum hard rod model, a one-dimensional extension of the Lieb-Liniger model, is exactly solved using an adapted Bethe ansatz. Our solution, benchmarked against path-integral quantum Monte Carlo calculations, reveals significant corrections to the excitation spectrum and thermodynamic properties, previously overlooked by the standard excluded-volume approach. We also show that the hard rod model exhibits Luttinger liquid behavior across a wide range of parameters, at zero and finite temperature, as unveiled by correlation functions. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding strongly correlated regimes in dilute 1D systems, with applications to quantum wires, spin chains, and ultracold atoms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implementing advanced trial wave functions in fermion quantum Monte Carlo via stochastic sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18519v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an efficient approach to implement correlated many-body trial wave functions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). To control the sign/phase problem in AFQMC, a constraint is derived from an exact gauge condition but is typically imposed approximately through a trial wave function or trial density matrix, whose quality can affect the accuracy of the method. Furthermore, the trial wave function can also affect the efficiency through importance sampling. The most natural form of the trial wave function has been single Slater determinants or their linear combinations. More sophisticated forms, for example, with the inclusion of a Jastrow factor or other explicit correlations, have been challenging to use and their implementation is often assumed to require a quantum computer. In this work, we demonstrate that a large class of correlated wave functions, written in the general form of multi-dimensional integrals over hidden or auxiliary variables times Slater determinants, can be implemented as trial wave function by coupling the random walkers to a generalized Metropolis sampling. We discuss the fidelity of AFQMC with stochastically sampled trial wave functions, which are relevant to both quantum and classical algorithms. We illustrate the method and show that an efficient implementation can be achieved which preserves the low-polynomial computational scaling of AFQMC. We test our method in molecules under bond stretching and in transition metal diatomics. Significant improvements are seen in both accuracy and efficiency over typical trial wave functions, and the method yields total ground-state energies systematically within chemical accuracy. The method can be useful for incorporating other advanced wave functions, for example, neural quantum state wave functions optimized from machine learning techniques, or for other forms of fermion quantum Monte Carlo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electronic interactions in a vacancy-engineered honeycomb lattice: Transition from a nodal-line semimetal to a magnetic insulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187v5)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines and those enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |

We obtain exact results for the order parameter distribution function that compare well to the quantum Monte Carlo data. Furthermore, based on a detailed finite-size analysis, we provide evidence that the thermal melting transition at the SU(3) point is either weakly first-order in this system or, if continuous, it falls beyond the unitary-bounds of conformal field theory.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

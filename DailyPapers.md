| **[Growth optimization of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate high-temperature superconducting thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18107v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of ambient-pressure nickelate high-temperature superconductivity provides a new platform for probing the underlying superconducting mechanisms. However, the thermodynamic metastability of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and oxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing phase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates using gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under an ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further post annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting film exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical factors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of Ln3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control suppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer coverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking faults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a single superconducting transition and high Tc,onset. These findings provide valuable insights for the layer-by-layer epitaxy growth of diverse oxide high-temperature superconducting films.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomalous narrow-band correlation in a natural superconducting heterostructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18099v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new frontier in condensed matter physics is to stack atomically thin layered-materials with different properties and create intriguing phenomena which do not exist in any of the constituent layers. Transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS$_2$, with an alternating stacking of a spin liquid candidate 1T-TaS$_2$ and a superconductor 1H-TaS$_2$, is a natural heterostructure for such a purpose. Recently, rare phenomena are indeed observed, including chiral superconductivity, two-component nematic superconductivity, topological surface superconductivity and enigmatic magnetic memory. A widely proposed starting point to understand such a mysterious heterostructure requires strong electronic correlation, presumably provided by 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with a narrow flat band near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the theoretically expected flat band near $E_F$ in the energy-momentum space for the first time. However, this flat band only exists on the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer with broken translational symmetry, but not on the 1T-TaS$_2$ layers buried in the bulk. These results directly challenge the foundation of the current theoretical paradigm. On the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer, we further reveal a pseudogap and an anomalous doping effect. These phenomena and the dichotomy between surface and bulk layers also shed new light on the unusual coexistence of distinct electronic orders in this mysterious heterostructure.</p></details> | under review |
| **[On-demand analog space-time in superconducting networks: grey holes, dynamical instability and exceptional points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01261v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.</p></details> | 33 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Automated, physics-guided, multi-parameter design optimization for superconducting quantum devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18027v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of nonlinear superconducting quantum circuits often relies on time-consuming iterative electromagnetic simulations requiring manual intervention. These interventions entail, for example, adjusting design variables such as resonator lengths or Josephson junction energies to meet target parameters such as mode frequencies, decay rates, and coupling strengths. Here, we present a method to efficiently automate the optimization of superconducting circuits, which significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. The method's efficiency arises from user-defined, physics-informed, nonlinear models that guide parameter updates toward the desired targets. Additionally, we provide a full implementation of our optimization method as an open-source Python package, QDesignOptimizer. The package automates the design workflow by combining high-accuracy electromagnetic simulations in Ansys HFSS and Energy Participation Ratio (pyEPR) analysis integrated with the design tool Qiskit-Metal. Our implementation supports modular and flexible subsystem-level analysis and is easily extensible to optimize for additional parameters. The method is not specific to superconducting circuits; as such, it can be applied to a range of nonlinear optimization problems across science and technology.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Optimization of superconducting properties of F-doped SmFeAsO by cubic anvil high-pressure technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17929v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We optimize the synthesis conditions for SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 (Sm1111) bulks using a cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) apparatus through both ex-situ and in-situ processes, applying pressures of up to 4 GPa and heating temperatures of up to 1600{\deg}C. A comprehensive characterization has been performed, including structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements. Our findings indicate that a modest growth pressure of approximately 0.5 GPa is sufficient for the formation of the Sm1111 phase in the ex-situ process. In contrast, the in-situ process requires higher synthesis pressure (4 GPa) and temperature (1400 {\deg}C for 1 hour) to achieve the Sm1111 phase with enhanced superconducting properties. Notably, the optimized in-situ process significantly reduces the reaction time needed for the formation of the Sm1111 phase compared to conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), leading to an increase in the transition temperature by 3 K and improvements in critical current density (Jc). Conversely, the optimized ex-situ process results in an onset transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 53 K, similar to that of CSP, though it enhances the Jc by an order of magnitude. Despite these advancements, a small amount of impurity phases, as observed during CSP, persists in all Sm1111 samples prepared through either the in-situ or ex-situ CA-HP processes. These results suggest that the in-situ process under optimized conditions (1400 {\deg}C, 4 GPa for 1 hour) can effectively improve the superconducting properties of Sm1111. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis comparing these results with high gas pressure techniques, spark plasma sintering, and CSP methods suggests that a small amount of impurity phases in Sm1111 is persistent and cannot be completely eliminated by various pressure techniques, even at the applied pressure of up to 4 GPa.</p></details> | 44 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Unveiling the landscape of Mottness and its proximity to superconductivity in 4Hb-TaS$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17861v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mott physics is at the root of a plethora of many-body quantum phenomena in quantum materials. Recently, the stacked or twisted structures of van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a unique platform for realizing exotic correlated states in the vicinity of the Mott transition. However, the definitive feature of Mottness and how it rules the low-energy electronic state remain elusive and experimentally inaccessible in many interesting regimes. Here, we quantitatively describe a filling-controlled Mott state and its interplay with superconductivity by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy in a vdW bulk heterostructure, 4Hb-TaS$_2$, that interleaves strongly correlated 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with superconducting 1H-Ta$_2$ layers. The fine tunability of electron doping induced by interlayer charge transfer allows us to continuously track the spectral function with unsurpassed energy resolution from a depleted narrow band (0.2 electrons per site) toward a Mott transition at half filling. The gradually emerging Mott-Hubbard bands, followed by the sharpening and vanishing of the central quasiparticle peak as predicted in the Brinkman-Rice scenario, unambiguously demonstrate the Mott physics at play. Importantly, the renormalization of the low-energy electrons acts destructively on the superconducting pairing potential, leaving behind nonsuperconducting, paramagnetic puddles at the nanoscale. Our results reveal a seminal system near the border of the Mott criterion that enables us to illustrate the predictive power of the Hubbard model, and set such heterostructures as promising ground for realizing new correlated states in the heavily doped Mott regime.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Mechanisms of superconductivity and inhomogeneous states in metallic hydrogen and electron systems with attraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17487v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Review we discuss anomalous aspects of superconductivity (SC) and normal state, as well as formation of inhomogeneous (droplet-like or cluster-like) states in electron systems with attraction. We consider both the models with the retardation (Eliashberg mechanism of SC for strong electron-phonon interaction in metallic hydrogen) and without retardation (but with local onsite attraction). We concentrate on the mechanism of the BCS-BEC crossover for the Hubbard model with local attraction and diagonal disorder for the two-dimensional films of the dirty metal. We analyze also the model of the inhomogeneous spaceseparated Fermi-Bose mixture for the bismuth oxides BaKBiO, which contains the paired clusters of bosonic states as well as unpaired fermionic clusters. Superconductivity is realized in this system due to local pairs tunneling from one bosonic cluster to the neighboring one via the fermionic barrier. For metallic hydrogen and metallic hydrides, we calculate the critical temperature and discuss important possibility for practical applications how to increase the temperature by decreasing pressure in the framework of the generalized Eliashberg approach. We advocate also interesting analogies with the quantum (vortex) crystal for long-living low-dimensional metastable phases of metallic hydrogen including filamentous phase with proton chains embedded in 3D electron Fermi liquid and planar phase with proton plains. We formulate the concept of two Bose-condensates in SC electron and superfluid (SF) ion subsystems and provide the estimate for the lifetime of the long-living metastable phases at normal pressure. The estimate is connected with the formation and growth of the critical seeds of the new (molecular) phase in the process of quantum under-barrier tunneling.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Ambient-Pressure Superconductivity from Boron Icosahedral Superatoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17422v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We identify a new family of XB$_{12}$, boron-rich compounds formed by interconnected B$_{12}$ icosahedra and electropositive guest atoms ($X$). These structures emerged from first-principles crystal structure prediction at 50 GPa, as part of a pressure-quenching strategy to discover superconductors that could be synthesized under pressure and retained at ambient conditions. The resulting structures are thermodynamically competitive, dynamically stable at zero pressure, and - when $X$ is a mono- or trivalent element - metallic and superconducting. Predicted critical temperatures reach up to 42 K for CsB$_{12}$, rivaling MgB$_2$, the highest-$T_c$ ambient-pressure conventional superconductor. We interpret the XB$_{12}$ phase as a superatomic crystal: the B$_{12}$ units retain their molecular identity while forming extended crystalline networks. Their delocalized orbitals support doping without structural destabilization, while their covalent bonding promotes strong electron-phonon coupling. Unlike MgB$_2$, where superconductivity is driven by a narrow subset of phonon modes, the XB$_{12}$ compounds exhibit broad, mode- and momentum-distributed coupling through both intra- and inter-superatomic vibrations. Our results highlight the XB$_{12}$ family as a promising platform for metastable superconductivity and demonstrate the potential of superatoms as functional building blocks in solid-state materials design.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Orbital-selective two-gap superconductivity in kagome metal CsV3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17327v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multigap superconductivity in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the interplay between its multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in governing multiple superconducting gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the superconducting gap of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals strongly couple to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the kagome-plane Sb-5pz orbital weakly interacts with Cs shearing phonon mode. Moreover, our calculations reveal EPC-induced band renormalization, manifested as kinks at approximately -13 meV and -30 meV in the electronic dispersion, consistent with prior experimental observations. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lattice Quantum Geometry Controlling 118 K Multigap Superconductivity in Heavily Overdoped CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13796v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been used to study the thermal structure evolution in CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d (Cu1234), a superconductor which exhibits a high critical temperature (Tc 118 K), high critical current density and large upper critical magnetic field. The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Self-consistent dynamical Hubbard functional for correlated solids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18194v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many-body functionals of the Green's function can provide fundamental advances in electronic-structure calculations, due to their ability to accurately predict both spectral and thermodynamic properties, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and total energies of materials. However, fully first-principles, self-consistent calculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge, ultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and restricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we present a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids using a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical Hubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating frequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to accurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials with $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we employ the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles representation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for frequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution for dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the paradigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral features, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving the description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Numerical validation of an ultracold Hubbard quantum simluator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18041v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply the formally exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method to probe the unprecedentedly low-temperature regime recently achieved in an ultracold-atom quantum simulation of the 2D Hubbard model [Xu et al., Nature 642, 909 (2025)]. Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Engineering Hubbard models with gated two-dimensional moiré systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13314v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moir\'e systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moir\'e potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moir\'e potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moir\'e potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moir\'e systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Hubbard energy dependence of electronic structures in rare-earth monoxides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12635v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To realize the significant potential of optical materials such as strongly electron-correlated open-shell rare-earth monoxides, understanding the electron-localization Hubbard parameters ($U$) is of central importance. The Hubbard energy is believed to be material specific and constant. However, it has recently been pointed out that even subtle structural changes can induce changes in $U$ parameters. For LuO, we theoretically evaluated $U$ energy dependence of the differential transmission and reflectivity spectra to assess the impact of $U$ energy on the optical properties. In addition to the conventional derivative-like contribution, we observed the influence of the Drude tail owing to $U$-induced plasma energy modulation. Given the typical detection sensitivity of differential spectroscopy ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-4}$), even a few meV modulations in $U$ are sufficient for a detectable spectral response.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Jpn.

| **[A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+9 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Path-integral Method for Fictitious Particle Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01760v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Excitation Gaps of Ground and Excited State Energy of the Fermi-Hubbard Model Using Variational Quantum Eigensolver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12307v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hubbard model is a challenging quantum many-body problem and serves as a benchmark for quantum computing research. Accurate computation of its ground and excited state energies is essential for understanding correlated electron systems. In this study, the ground, first, and second excited state energies of 4$\times$1 and 2$\times$2 Hubbard lattices are obtained using a newly designed ansatz circuit. The ansatz is constructed by combining concepts from the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and the Number-Preserving Ansatz (NPA). A hybrid optimization strategy is applied, where COBYLA is used for coarse convergence and L-BFGS for fine-tuning. The resulting energies are evaluated, and the corresponding physical properties of the systems are analyzed through phase diagrams of the energy excitation gaps for different charge and spin configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lieb's Theorem for Bose Hubbard Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10319v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary finite-size lattice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phases and critical transport of the SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10023v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the study of phases and transitions of SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field on the triangular lattice. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 8, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from parton mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U and the number of flavor N . We construct the critical theory for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid and calculate the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N . These results could be validated in synthetic systems such as moir'e superlattices and cold atom platforms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness and short-range magnetic order in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20714v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study doping and temperature dependencies of temporal and spatial spin stiffnesses of the Hubbard model within the mean field approach for incommensurate magnetic order. We show that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness within the considered mean-field approach is crucial to obtain small values of correlation length, comparable to those observed in cuprates. Using the obtained spin stiffnesses, we obtain the temperature and doping dependence of correlation length within the large-$N$ limit of the respective nonlinear sigma model. In agreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short range magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping region $0.05\lesssim x \lesssim 0.1$. The latter state may correspond to the spin-frosen state, observed in the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+7 p...</summary><p>8+7 pages, 3+5 figures</p></details> |

Here we optimize both gate and qubit counts of recent algorithms for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model. We further devise and compile algorithms to simulate established models of cuprate and pnictide high-temperature superconductors, which include beyond-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and multi-orbital interactions that are absent in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We show that simulations of these more realistic models of high-temperature superconductors require only an order of magnitude or so more Toffoli gates than a simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli and qubit counts that far lower than commonly considered quantum phase estimation circuits for electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry. We believe our results pave the way towards studying high-temperature superconductors on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Close...</summary><p>Close to journal version</p></details> |
| **[Symmetry-breaking perturbations in the Jahn-Teller-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07477v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the effect of symmetry-breaking perturbations in the multiorbital Hubbard model coupled to anisotropic Jahn-Teller phonons, which is relevant for the description of fulleride superconductors. This system is often approximated by a model with static antiferromagnetic (AFM) Hund's coupling, in which the coupling to the Jahn-Teller phonon is effectively described, but the retardation effect associated with phonon propagation is neglected. We compare the properties of the models with static AFM Hund's coupling and dynamical Jahn-Teller electron-phonon interaction by means of the Eliashberg theory. Considering the susceptibilities for the spin, magnetic orbital, electric orbital, and superconductivity, we reveal a qualitatively different behavior between the two models in the case of the magnetic orbital susceptibility. We further study the effect of a magnetic field on the $s$-wave spin-singlet superconducting state. In the presence of the field, the magnetic orbital susceptibility becomes nonzero due to a combination of multiorbital and retardation effects, while the spin susceptibility remains zero at low temperatures. By analyzing this phenomenon both numerically and analytically, we clarify that odd-frequency pairs induced by the magnetic field play a crucial role in the spin and orbital magnetic susceptibilities. Thus, the magnetic degrees of freedom produce interesting behaviors in the presence of retardation effects associated with electron-phonon coupling.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Insulator-bad metal transition in RNiO$_3$ nickelates beyond Hubbard model and density functional theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07377v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The insulator-bad metal transition observed in the Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth or yttrium Y) is considered to be a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of the Hubbard $U$-$t$-model and the density functional theory. However, actually the real insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet (S=1) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless (S=0) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. Taking account of only charge degree of freedom we develop a novel minimal $U$-$V$-$t_b$-model for nickelates making use of the charge triplet model with the pseudospin formalism and effective field approximation. We show the existence of two types of CD-phases, high-temperature classical CO-phase with the G-type charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and low-temperature quantum CDq-phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, uncertain valence and spin value for NiO$_6$ centers.

It is desired to look for other possible microscopic mechanism of realizing high-temperature SC. Here, we explore the interplay between the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and the Hubbard repulsion by density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) simulations. Our state-of-the-art DMRG study showed convincingly that the interplay between strong Hubbard $U$ and moderate Su-Schrieffer-Heeger EPC $\lambda$ can induce robust $d$-wave SC. The SSH-type EPC can generate effective antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions between neighboring sites, which plays a crucial role in the interplay of inducing robust $d$-wave SC. Specifically, for $U=8t$, we find that $d$-wave SC emerges when $\lambda>\lambda_c$ with a moderate critical value $\lambda_c=0.1\sim 0.2$. Our results might shed new light to understanding high-temperature SC in cuprates as well as pave a possible new route in looking for high-temperature SC in other quantum materials with both strong $U$ and moderate $\lambda$.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages + Supplemental Materials, 4 figures, published version in Science Bulletin</p></details> |

Employing a mean-field theoretical framework, both analytically and numerically, we demonstrate that positions and sizes of specific phases on the diagram are magnetization dependent. In particular, non-zero magnetization introduces different Mott insulator phase boundaries for each of the two components. This effect leads to the emergence of a hybrid phase characterized by the coexistence of superfluid in one of the components and Mott insulator in the another one. Our findings highlight the important role of a conserved quantities, which is magnetization here, in reshaping the phase landscape, significantly influencing the stability and emergence of distinct quantum phases.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is approximately quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasiparticle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping away from half-filling, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states away from the $\Sigma$ gap edge may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity and other instabilities of doped Mott insulators.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 8 figures.

Here, we investigate the bilayer two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard model for $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ using cellular dynamical mean-field theory. We find two intertwined $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivities with distinct physical origins under enhanced Hund's coupling $J_H$. We show that when $d_{z^2}$ orbital is half-filled and its bonding band lies below Fermi level, electron pairing associated to $J_H$ prevails. As $d_{z^2}$ orbital is hole-doped, this superconducting state becomes suppressed and a second superconductivity, which is largely insensitive to $J_H$ but exhibiting a critical reliance on $d_{z^2}$ - $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hybridization $V$, arises. These two pairing states exhibit comparable maximum transition temperatures and evolve continuously from one to the other with varying $d_{z^2}$ doping, resulting a smooth $T_c$ versus doping evolution. The dependence on various physical parameters of the two superconductivities is studied. Our results present a unified picture reconciling the debate about the role of $d_{z^2}$ orbital in pairing. We discuss the relevance of our results to recent experiments on superconducting $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ films.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate the steady-state properties of a one-dimensional lattice system that allows multiple particle occupancy on each site. The particles undergo stochastic nearest-neighbor jumps influenced by both a directional bias and on-site repulsive interactions. With periodic boundary conditions, we observe a non-monotonic dependence of inter-site correlation functions on the interaction strength. At large interaction strengths, the particle current exhibits a periodic dependence on density, accompanied by the formation of ordered stacks of particles. In contrast, with open boundary conditions, the system displays step-like density profiles reminiscent of those in tilted Bose-Hubbard systems, and a regime with a macroscopic number of empty sites followed by a steep parameter-dependent increase in density. Our results highlight how the interplay between drive, interaction, and boundary conditions leads to distinctive signatures on the current and density profiles in the steady state in different regimes.} {We also study the problem on a random comb, a simple model of a disordered system.</p></details> | 14 pages, 15 figures |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust stripes in the mixed-dimensional $t-J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07366v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopically understanding competing orders in strongly correlated systems is a key challenge in modern quantum many-body physics. For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

The realization of superconductivity in thin films requires delicate control of growth conditions, which presents significant challenges in the synthesis process. Furthermore, the stability of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ films is compromised by oxygen loss, which complicates their characterization. We introduce an effective recycling protocol that involves oxygen removal in a precursor phase followed by ozone-assisted annealing, which restores superconducting properties. By tuning the oxygen content, we construct an electronic phase diagram that highlights oxygen addition as a potential analogue to hole doping via La substitution with Sr, providing insights into the doping mechanism and guiding future material optimization.</p></details> |  |

Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the presence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset temperatures at $\sim$140 K and $\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity measurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\rm SDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic nematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge order. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to approximately 70 K. These compelling experimental observations provide critical insights into the coexistence and manipulability of density wave phenomena in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, laying a foundation for future research into their optical control.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding the interplay between the associated density wave (DW) fluctuations and superconductivity, as well as the orbital character and symmetry underlying the DW instabilities. Here we utilize polarized Raman scattering to investigate the phononic and electronic Raman responses of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ across its concomitant charge and spin density wave transitions. In addition to distinct phonon anomalies occurring below the transition temperature, we observe a depletion of continuum spectral weight up to 114 meV and a pronounced peak centered at this energy. By combining momentum-selective information from polarized electronic Raman scattering with model calculations involving both Ni-3$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, we identify 114 meV as the energy scale $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ of the DW gap, characterized by incoherent opening and non-mean-field behavior. Furthermore, the model calculations reveal that the corresponding $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ peak exhibits a multiorbital origin, thus shedding light on the nature of the DW instabilities in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$.</p></details> |  |

This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages, 5 figures with Appendix</p></details> |

However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cells limits spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa where structural transition appears. In addition, the observation of a single density wave gap indicates that the spin density wave and charge density wave remain coupled as pressure increases, rather than decoupling. After the density wave collapse, a distinct low-temperature regime emerges, characterized by a small gap consistent with potential superconducting pairing. The separated phase region of superconductivity and density waves suggests that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pairing without $γ$-Pocket in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20287v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film at ambient pressure has aroused great research interest. The $\gamma$-pocket formed by the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band, which was previously proposed to be crucial in the pairing mechanism of pressurized bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, is reported to be either present or absent here by different experimental groups, giving rise to the problem: what is the pairing mechanism and pairing nature without the $\gamma$-pocket? Here, we start from a band structure obtained via density-functional-theoretical calculation, which exhibits no $\gamma$-pocket. Then, equipped with electron interactions, we study the pairing nature via combined weak- and strong- coupling approaches, which provide consistent results. In the weak-coupling study, the nesting between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$- pockets leads to an $s^\pm$-wave pairing in which the gap signs on the two pockets are opposite, as provided by our random-phase-approximation based calculations. In real-space, the pairing pattern is dominated by the interlayer pairing of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong-coupling study, as the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals are nearly half-filled and hence localized, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals carry the HTSC. Driven by the interlayer superexchange transferred from the $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the Hund's rule coupling, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital electrons form interlayer $s$-wave pairing, as suggested by our slave-boson-mean-field study on the related two-orbital $t$-$J$ model. Projected onto the Fermi surface, this pairing just gives the $s^\pm$-wave pattern consistent with that obtained in the weak-coupling study. Our result is consistent with that obtained in recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment.</p></details> |  |

The $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are found to shift down with correlation while their Fermi surfaces become highly damped and cannot to be resolved experimentally. In contrast, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fermi surfaces do not vary much with correlation and they are sharp enough to be detected in experiments. The spin susceptibility peaks at a wave vector in the odd channel, connecting the symmetric $\gamma$ band and the asymmetric $\delta$ band. The superconducting pairing symmetry is robustly $s$-wave and the $\delta$ band has the largest pairing magnitude. All the findings suggest a dominant role of the $3d_{z^{2}}$ orbital in this material.</p></details> |  |

We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states around the $\Gamma$ point, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations due to Fermi surface nesting of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states near the interface. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

We systematically investigate the band structures and electronic correlation effect to identify the key factors controlling superconductivity and pathways to enhance $T_c$. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct a bilayer two-orbital ($3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$) tight-binding model for a series of in-plane compression mimicking the substrate effect. We find the band energy at the $M$ point drops with the compression, leading to increase of the density of states at the Fermi level, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk under pressure. We then apply functional renormalization group (FRG) method to study the electronic correlation effect on the superconductivity. We find the $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust in the films, the same as the bulk. But somewhat surprisingly, for the films, we find $T_c$ can be enhanced by reducing the in-plane lattice constant, increasing the out-of-plane lattice constant, or further electron-doping. These findings are consistent with the itinerant picture of the superconductivity induced by spin-fluctuations and provide theoretical support for further boosting $T_c$ in future experiments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p></details> |  |

Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally observed nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. In addition, by analysing the orbital-resolved pairing configurations and their projections onto Fermi surface, we find that the nodeless feature of $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Moreover, we identify a formation of the inplane inter-orbital $d$-wave pairing between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which can even enhance the dominated interlayer $s_\pm$-wave.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements of superconducting (La,Pr,Sm)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates by developing an ultra-high vacuum low-temperature quenching and transfer technique. A finite superconducting gap of ~18 meV with pronounced coherence peak is observed along the Brillouin zone diagonal direction. Remarkably, the finite superconducting gap persists across the entire Brillouin zone of the underlying Fermi surfaces, revealing the absence of gap nodes. An abrupt band renormalization, manifested as a kink in the energy-momentum dispersion at ~70 meV below the Fermi level, indicates an electron-boson coupling in the system. The simultaneous observation of a nodeless superconducting gap and electron-boson coupling provides crucial insights into the pairing symmetry and gluing mechanism in high-T$_c$ RP bilayer nickelates.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule.

One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</p></details> |  |

We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In the hydrostatic pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in effective on-site repulsion in the maximally localized Wannier functions comprising the Ni 3$d$ $e_g$ bands crossing the Fermi energy, as determined by density functional theory. We attribute this increase to reduced screening by the spacer La 5$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ bands -- an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electron correlations. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines.

However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to a unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetically ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest a simultaneous formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ , thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</p></details> | 21 pages. 17 figures |

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18564v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $\Delta \lambda(T) \sim T^\alpha$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $\alpha < 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{\alpha_R}$ with $\alpha_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.</p></details> | 29 pages, 23 figures |

This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state. Taking into account the large decrease in $K_a$ in the SC state, we conclude that the $\boldsymbol{d}$ vector has components along all three crystal axes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 Figures + Supplemental Material with 18 pages, 16 Figures</p></details> |

We have investigated the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition in high-quality crystals of UTe$_2$ by tracking its signature in the magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$. A single, sharp superconducting transition is observed at low pressures 0.3 GPa. At higher pressure, a second feature emerges in $\chi(T)$, which is located at the lower-temperature thermodynamic phase boundary previously identified in specific heat measurements. This second transition anomaly in $\chi(T)$ can be attributed to a step change in the London penetration depth, providing direct evidence for a change in the superconducting order parameter of UTe$_2$. Thermodynamic constraints suggest that the low temperature, high pressure superconducting state is distinct from zero pressure superconductivity as well as from the high pressure, high temperature superconducting state, raising the possibility of multicomponent superconductivity in high pressure UTe$_2$.</p></details> |  |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |

The surface flat bands originate from topological features supported by two key mechanisms: (1) a trivial Chern number prevents the zero-energy states from merging into the continuum of the bulk spectrum, thereby ensuring their confinement within the superconducting gap; and (2) weak spin conservation allows the gap function to exhibit phase winding. As a consequence, the surface exhibits a remarkably high density of states at nearly zero energy. Such surface states are likely to be realized in the candidate topological superconductor UTe$_2$. Our results provide important insights into the interpretation of recent Josephson STM experiments on UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 5 pages + 9 pages |

The strong, non-perturbative influence of the magnetic field complicates the determination of superconducting order parameters in the high-field phases. Here, we report electronic transport anisotropy measurements in precisely aligned microbars in magnetic fields to 45 T applied along the b-axis. Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter. A pair-density-wave-like state at high fields could naturally induce a layered modulation of the superfluid density, forming planar structures that confine vortices and guide their sliding in the flux-flow regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surface charge density wave in UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12505v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</p></details> |  |

Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+17...</summary><p>11+17 pages, 4+14 figures. v2: Discussions added with minor changes in the acknowledgement</p></details> |

In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional charged Andreev bound states in a superconductor with a sublattice degree of freedom, where the sign of charge density of the Andreev bound states oscillates between the two sublattices. The oscillating-charged Andreev bound states lead to a complete breakdown of the proportionality among the electron part of the spectral function, the local density of states, and the tunneling conductance spectrum for energies below the superconducting gap. We also discuss the possible occurrence of these Andreev bound states in UTe$_2$ and locally noncentrosymmetric superconductors.</p></details> |  |

However, a comprehensive understanding of the topological phases in the superconducting states of UTe$_2$ is still lacking. Here, we present an exhaustive classification of topological phases for all time-reversal symmetry breaking pairing symmetries of UTe$_2$. Using the K theoretical classification approach, we uncover that 25 out of 36 possible pairing states are classified as higher-order topological phases, with some demonstrating hybrid-order topology through an intricate interplay of hinge and corner states. Furthermore, under the weak-coupling condition of the pair potentials, the possible pairing symmetries are constrained to $B_{ju} + i B_{ku}$, $A_{u} + i B_{j u}$, and $B_{j g} + iA_u$ ($j,k = 1,2,3$; $j \neq k$), where these symbols denote the irreducible representations of the point group $D_{2h}$. For these pairing states, the topological invariants are related to the Fermi surface topology via the Fermi-surface formula, enabling us to systematically diagnose higher-order topological phases. Using a tight-binding model, we demonstrate the higher-order topological phases of the mixed-parity $A_u + iB_{1g}$ superconductors, where the second-order and hybrid-order topological phases emerge as the number of Fermi surfaces enclosing the time-reversal invariant momentum evolves from two to four. The findings suggest that UTe$_2$ serves as a compelling platform for exploring higher-order topological superconductors with diverse topological surface states.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

Its surface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we propose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface and in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual features detected by surface probes in this material. Through a phenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental signatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of CDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii) the magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the CDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature and its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental checks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |

Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagom\'e lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagom\'e lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagom\'e metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagom\'e lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |

However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120{\deg}, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Connecting such bosonic $\pi$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $\pi$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04601v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</p></details> |  |

Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+3 p...</summary><p>9+3 pages, 10 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect. The present theory predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity, which is significant to understand the cascade of quantum electron states in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

However, to our best knowledge, unconventional magnetic states driven by van Hove singularities--like spin-density waves--have not been observed experimentally in kagome metals. Here, we report the magnetic and electronic structure of the layered kagome metal CeTi3Bi4, where Ti kagome electronic structure interacts with a magnetic sublattice of Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments. Neutron diffraction reveals an incommensurate spin-density wave ground state of the Ce3+ moments, coexisting with commensurate antiferromagnetic order across most of the temperature-field phase diagram. The commensurate component is preferentially suppressed by thermal fluctuations and magnetic field, yielding a rich phase diagram involving an intermediate single-Q spin-density wave phase. First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy identify van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, with the observed magnetic propagation vectors connecting their high density of states, strongly suggesting a van Hove singularity-assisted spin-density wave. These findings establish kagome metals LnTi3Bi4 as a model platform where the characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice plays a pivotal role in magnetic order.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, SI not included</p></details> |

Weak-coupling analyses and mean field calculations have demonstrated that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_2$ drives, respectively, real and imaginary bond-ordered CDW, with the latter corresponding to time-reversal symmetry breaking loop current CDW. It is important to understand the inter-layer correlation of these bond-ordered CDWs and its consequences in the bulk kagom\'e materials. To provide physical insights, we investigate in this paper the $c$-axis stacking of them, loop current CDW in particular, on the minimal bilayer kagom\'e lattice. The bare susceptibilities for stacking of real and imaginary bond orders are calculated for the free electrons on the bilayer kagom\'e lattice with inter-layer coupling $t_\perp=0.2t$, which splits the van Hove filling to $n_{+\text{vH}}=4.64/12$ and $n_{-\text{vH}}=5.44/12$. While real and imaginary bond-ordered CDWs are still favored, respectively, by $V_1$ and $V_2$, their inter-layer coupling is sensitive to band filling $n$. They tend to stack symmetrically near $n_{\pm\text{vH}}$ with identical bond orders in the two layers and give rise to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 1c_0$ CDW. On the other hand, they prefer to stack antisymmetrically around $n_\text{vH}$ with opposite bond orders in the two layers and lead to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 2c_0$ CDW. The concrete bilayer $t$-$t_\perp$-$V_1$-V$_2$ model is then studied. We obtain the mean-field ground states and determine the inter-layer coupling as a function of band filling at various interactions.

The estimated magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 10$a$ ($a$ is the lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) above the surface could be in the order of 100mT; thus, they may be detectable by currently available detection methods. Next, we investigate the use of them as qubits (the ``SVILC qubits'') in an architecture composed of three nano-islands of the thin film; and consider the use of the detection of the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs as the qubit readout. We show there are a number of energy levels suitable for qubit states that can be manipulated by external current feeding, and the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs is large enough to be used for the readout.</p></details> |  |

Recent experiments report evidence for a chiral charge density wave (CDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb or Cs). Theoretical analyses propose a topologically nontrivial loop current phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry as the favorable CDW ground state. However, spectroscopic insights into the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds are still missing and conflicting experimental results question the presence of a loop current phase. We employed individual magnetic atoms as local quantum sensors to examine the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Our spectroscopic measurements show that the magnetic moment of Co induces a spatially-localized low-energy state in the CDW phase. The distinct spectral signatures of this state are consistent with theoretical expectations for the quasiparticle excitation of a loop current order parameter, while control experiment rule out alternative scenario.

Here, we conduct comprehensive magnetotransport measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and, through mobility spectrum analysis, identify the formation of tiny Fermi pockets with extremely high mobility below the CDW transition. Furthermore, electron irradiation experiments reveal that the non-monotonic Hall effect is significantly suppressed in samples with reduced mobility, despite no substantial change in the electronic structure. These results indicate that the non-monotonic Hall effect originates from these tiny Fermi pockets with high mobility carriers rather than anomalous Hall mechanisms, providing new insights into understanding the Hall anomaly in this kagome system.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, Supplemental Material</p></details> |

We identify that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. Operationally, this measure quantifies how well an operator can be approximated by one with only a few Pauli strings -- analogous to how entanglement entropy relates to tensor-network truncation. A notable advantage of operator stabilizer entropies is their inherent locality, as captured by a Lieb-Robinson bound. This feature makes them particularly suited for studying local dynamical magic resource generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that under random evolution, operator magic typically reaches near-maximal value for all R\'enyi indices, and we evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we solve the operator stabilizer entropy for interacting integrable XXZ circuit, finding that it quickly saturates to a constant value. Overall, this measure sheds light on the structural properties of many-body non-stabilizerness generation and can inspire Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+16 ...</summary><p>5+16 Pages, 2 figures. v4: fixed mistake in Appendix</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take > $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\mu$s to produce a sample.

Compared to existing architectures, in a unitary network each local tensor is required to be a unitary matrix upon suitable reshaping. Global unitarity is ensured when the network obeys a suitable ordering property. Unitary operators represented by unitary networks need not preserve locality. In particular, we show that the class of unitary networks encompasses global unitaries which preserve locality up to exponentially suppressed tails, as in those that naturally arise from the finite-time evolution of local Hamiltonians. Non-invertible symmetries, as exemplified by the non-local Kramers-Wannier duality in one dimension, can also be represented using unitary networks. We also show that information flow in a unitary network can be characterized by a flow index, which matches the known index for quantum cellular automata as a special case.</p></details> |  |

Using homogeneous parton mean field theory, we find that the stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for Kitaev coupling $K>0$ and the ferromagnetic (FM) order for $K<0$, both vanish at sufficiently large doping, beyond which we find regimes with chiral $d\pm i d$ singlet pairing and $p\pm ip$ triplet pairing respectively. Our tensor network computations however reveal that the superconducting correlations are strongly suppressed; while FM order stubbornly persists for the doped $K<0$ model, the doped $K>0$ model features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping for $K > 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter $K_{\rm sc} < 1$. Our work sets the stage for a broader exploration of doping effects in triangular lattice magnets such as NaRuO$_2$ which feature bond-dependent exchange interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures, with additional supplemental material and figures</p></details> |
| **[Emergent statistical mechanics in holographic random tensor networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16570v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have enjoyed substantial progress in capturing properties of complex quantum systems by means of random tensor networks (RTNs), which form ensembles of quantum states that depend only on the tensor network geometry and bond dimensions. Of particular interest are RTNs on hyperbolic geometries, with local tensors typically chosen from the unitary Haar measure, that model critical boundary states of holographic bulk-boundary dualities. In this work, we elevate static pictures of ensemble averages to a dynamical one, to show that RTN states exhibit equilibration of time-averaged operator expectation values under a highly generic class of Hamiltonians with non-degenerate spectra. We prove that RTN states generally equilibrate at large bond dimension and also in the scaling limit for three classes of geometries: Those of matrix product states, regular hyperbolic tilings, and single "black hole" tensors. Furthermore, we prove a hierarchy of equilibration between finite-dimensional instances of these classes for bulk and boundary states with small entanglement. This suggests an equivalent hierarchy between corresponding many-body phases, and reproduces a holographic degree-of-freedom counting for the effective dimension of each system. These results demonstrate that RTN techniques can probe aspects of late-time dynamics of quantum many-body phases and suggest a new approach to describing aspects of holographic dualities using techniques from statistical mechanics.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Statistics-encoded tensor network approach in disordered quantum many-body spin chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16286v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems with disorder is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose a general approach -- the statistics-encoded tensor network (SeTN) -- to study such systems. By encoding disorder into an auxiliary layer and averaging separately, SeTN restores translational invariance, enabling a well-defined transfer matrix formulation. We derive a universal criterion, $n \gg \alpha^2 t^2$, linking discretization $n$, disorder strength $\alpha$, and evolution duration $t$. This sets the resolution required for faithful disorder averaging and shows that encoding is most efficient in the weak-disorder, typically chaotic regime. Applied to the disordered transverse-field Ising model, SeTN shows that the spectral form factor is governed by the leading transfer-matrix eigenvalue, in contrast to the kicked Ising model. SeTN thus provides a novel framework for probing the disorder-driven dynamical phenomena in many-body quantum systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-temperature Gibbs states with tensor networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08300v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (towards lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well-suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical 1D case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a CFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating classical simulations with a quantum processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15759v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As simulations of quantum systems cross the limits of classical computability, both quantum and classical approaches become hard to verify. Scaling predictions are therefore based on local structure and asymptotic assumptions, typically with classical methods being used to evaluate quantum simulators where possible. Here, in contrast, we use a quantum annealing processor to produce a ground truth for evaluating classical tensor-network methods whose scaling has not yet been firmly established. Our observations run contrary to previous scaling predictions, demonstrating the need for caution when extrapolating the accuracy of classical simulations of quantum dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the virtuous cycle of competition between classical and quantum simulations can lend insight in both directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10808v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analysis of First- and Quasi-Second-Order Optimization Algorithms in Variational Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19576v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first-order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, quasi-second-order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first-order methods. However, the relative performance of first-order and second-order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first-order and quasi-second-order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first-order and quasi-second-order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second-order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: quasi-second-order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first-order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting far away from the ground state. This makes quasi-second-order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.</p></details> | 23 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Matrix Product Operator Constructions for Gauge Theories in the Thermodynamic Limit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14145v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a general method for simulating lattice gauge theories in low dimensions using infinite matrix product states (iMPS). A central challenge in Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space associated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law permits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct efficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes background fields and $\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the standard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D gauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as infinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a benchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing expected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical behavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it can be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and infinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Experimental measurements revealed a non-magnetic ground state at $T \sim 8\, \text{K}$ with magnetic properties dominated by dimerization. We propose a spatially anisotropic Heisenberg model for the Cu$^{2+}$ spin-$1/2$ degrees of freedom on this geometrically frustrated and effectively two-dimensional maple-leaf lattice, featuring five symmetry inequivalent couplings with ferromagnetic bonds on hexagons and antiferromagnetic triangular bonds. The validity of the proposed Hamiltonian is demonstrated by state-of-the-art tensor network calculations, which can assess both the nature of the ground state as well as low-temperature thermodynamics, including the effects of a magnetic field. We provide theoretical support for a picture of a non-trivially correlated dimer ground state, which accounts for the appreciable reduction of the magnetic moment at high temperatures observed in experiment, thereby resolving a long-standing puzzle. We predict the static spin structure factor as well as the emergence of magnetisation plateaus at high values of an external magnetic field, explore the nature of the quantum states in them, and study their melting with increasing temperature.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, revised version</p></details> |
| **[Gauging the variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10822v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) constitute a powerful variational ansatz for capturing ground state physics of two-dimensional quantum systems. However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational PEPS in general settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 + 1...</summary><p>7 + 10 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Here, we carry out a similar construction using two copies of non-interacting Euler insulators to produce a class of spinful interacting Euler models. To that end, we take advantage of the recently discovered exact representation of certain Euler insulators by a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) of bond dimension $D = 2$. The Gutzwiller projection can be implemented within the tensor network formalism, giving rise to a new PEPS of bond dimension $D = 4$. We, moreover, apply very recent state-of-the-art tensor network tools to evaluate these phases. In particular, we analyze its entanglement entropy scaling and find no topological correction to the area law, indicating that the state is not intrinsically topologically ordered. Its entanglement spectrum shows a clear cusp at momentum zero, similar to non-interacting Euler insulators, and the spectrum of the transfer operator indicates that the state is gapped, which could imply non-intrinsic topological features. Finally, the static structure factor displays Bragg peaks, indicating the simultaneous presence of local order.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

The central innovation of our method lies in utilizing variational boundary tensors as a globally optimized environment for the entire system. Based on this optimized environment, we construct renormalization projectors that significantly enhance accuracy. By leveraging the canonical form of tensors, our algorithm maintains the same computational complexity as the original tensor renormalization group (TRG) method, yet achieves higher accuracy than existing approaches that do not incorporate entanglement filtering. Our work offers a practical pathway for extending TRG methods to higher dimensions while keeping computational costs manageable.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Riemannian Approach to the Lindbladian Dynamics of a Locally Purified Tensor Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08127v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks offer a valuable framework for implementing Lindbladian dynamics in many-body open quantum systems with nearest-neighbor couplings. In particular, a tensor network ansatz known as the Locally Purified Density Operator employs the local purification of the density matrix to guarantee the positivity of the state at all times. Within this framework, the dissipative evolution utilizes the Trotter-Suzuki splitting, yielding a second-order approximation error. However, due to the Lindbladian dynamics' nature, employing higher-order schemes results in non-physical quantum channels. In this work, we leverage the gauge freedom inherent in the Kraus representation of quantum channels to improve the splitting error. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold of isometries and find a solution via the second-order trust-region algorithm. We validate our approach using two nearest-neighbor noise models and achieve an improvement of orders of magnitude compared to other positivity-preserving schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method as a compression scheme, helping to control the exponential growth of computational resources, which thus far has limited the use of the locally purified ansatz.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, and several diagrams</p></details> |
| **[Quantum circuit simulation with a local time-dependent variational principle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10096v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum computing, condensed matter, and beyond.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

This network consists of local tensors that contain a numerical and a Grassmann part. We truncate the initial tensor at a fixed order in the inverse coupling $\beta$ and compute analytical results for the partition function, the free energy, and the chiral condensate on a $2\times2$ lattice up to order $\beta^4$. In a follow-up paper we will introduce an enhanced tensor-network method, order-separated GHOTRG, to explicitly compute the expansion coefficients of the partition function for larger lattices.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model.

In QSCI/SQD a quantum circuit is repeatedly prepared on the quantum device, and measured configurations form a subspace of the many-body Hilbert space in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized classically. For the dissociation of N$_2$ and a model $\mathrm{[2Fe-2S]}$ cluster (correlating 10 electrons in 26 orbitals and 30 electrons in 20 orbitals, respectively) we show that a non-perturbative stochastic approach, phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), using truncated SQD trial wavefunctions obtained from quantum hardware can recover a substantial amount (e.g., O(100) mHa) of correlation energy and alleviate the possible sampling redundancy of the QSCI/SQD procedure. Extrapolation of the ph-AFQMC energy versus the energy variance of the SQD trial wavefunctions has the potential to further improve the energy accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>15+4 ...</summary><p>15+4 pages, 10+7 figures</p></details> |

It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised machine learning, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions. Additionally, we conduct a regression task to predict superfluid density, which reflects non-local properties of the quantum system, and achieve good accuracy. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Finally, using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the machine learning models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable input format for machine learning in quantum many-body physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 23 figures, revised version with new results including transfer learning and interpretability</p></details> |

However, the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations cannot be applied to it with general interactions due to the sign problem. The model has therefore been investigated primarily by variational methods, where the accuracy of the results depends crucially on the ansatz for the wave function. Here we perform the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the case of small systems at finite temperature using the complex Langevin method (CLM), which has been successfully applied to various interesting systems with the sign problem over the decade. In particular, we show the existence of a parameter region in which the validity criterion for the CLM is satisfied and the expectation value of the energy obtained by exact diagonalization is correctly reproduced. Thus the CLM can be a complementary approach to the variational method for large systems.</p></details> | 19 pages, 12 figures |

We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Many-Body Simulations of Catalytic Metal Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13036v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate quantum simulations of catalysis on metal surfaces are critical for advancing energy and materials science. Yet most existing methods fall short: density functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational efficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction energetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in contrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when applied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a quantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of accurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while retaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such as auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at catalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable framework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy for two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference site of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface, where conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving quantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals why DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the critical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION thus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of complex catalytic systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+9 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Path-integral Method for Fictitious Particle Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01760v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Load-Balanced Diffusion Monte Carlo Method with Lattice Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12033v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a stochastic approach for solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation without resorting to one-body approximations. QMC algorithms are readily parallelizable via ensembles of $N_w$ walkers, making them well suited to large-scale high-performance computing. Among the QMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most reliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given Hamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of DMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which discretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework. DMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to stabilize walker weights and populations. At the branching step, walkers must be synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or GPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The conventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance, which grows as $\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel architectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently addresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved weak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a water-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and load-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by utilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high parallel efficiency ($\sim$98\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\rm w}= 51200$), together with a speedup of $\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the conventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers.</p></details> | 36 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model: enhanced $d$-wave and weakened $s^\pm$-wave pairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10503v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Untwisted and Twisted Rényi Negativities: Toward a Rényi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07731v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving R\'{e}nyi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted R\'{e}nyi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: 3...</summary><p>v2: 30 pages, 8 figures (add a figure for overview illustration, change section structure and add a table summarizing difference of untwisted and twisted Renyi nagativity); v1: 29 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Here, we show that RAS can explain the dramatic enhancement of superconductivity-relative to bulk FeSe, observed in single-unit-cell FeSe films on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and related substrates. Moreover, we present evidence that RAS may play a central role in driving the Cooper pair condensate into a bipolaronic superfluid state. This interpretation aligns with a recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation by Zhang, et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 011010 (2023)], which indicated enhanced bipolaronic superconductivity in two-dimensional systems with moderately strong electron-phonon coupling. RAS may therefore represent a promising strategy for engineering high-T$_c$ superconducting heterostructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Bose-Hubbard polaron from weak to strong coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00486v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.</p></details> |  |

For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a ''chiral flux'' phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)$_m$ magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. Further, sufficiently strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>19+8 ...</summary><p>19+8 pages, 11+4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations with Set-Equivariant Architectures and Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06441v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-learning (ML) ans\"atze have greatly expanded the accuracy and reach of variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, in particular when exploring the manifold quantum phenomena exhibited by spin systems. However, the scalability of QMC is still compromised by several other bottlenecks, and specifically those related to the actual evaluation of observables based on random deviates that lies at the core of the approach. Here we show how the set-transformer architecture can be used to dramatically accelerate or even bypass that step, especially for time-consuming operators such as powers of the magnetization. We illustrate the procedure with a range of examples of increasing complexity, from the classical Ising model to quantum systems with long-range interactions, and comprising both regressions (to predict observables) and classifications (to detect phase transitions). Moreover, we show how transfer learning can be leveraged to reduce the training cost by reusing knowledge from different systems and smaller system sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Particle Dispersion and Density of States of the Half-Filled 2D Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02614v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementing an improved method for analytic continuation and working with imaginary-time correlation functions computed using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we resolve the single-particle dispersion relation and the density of states (DOS) of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is approximately quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasiparticle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping away from half-filling, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states away from the $\Sigma$ gap edge may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity and other instabilities of doped Mott insulators.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Extraordinary surface critical behavior induced by a topological dimer phase in a two-dimensional Heisenberg quantum magnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04973v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study the dimerized spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice, focusing on the paramagnetic dimer phase and its edge states, and associated surface criticality behavior. The model can also be viewed as two-dimensional antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled usual ladders with AF rungs. We demonstrate that the dimer phase of the model, previously considered topologically trivial, is actually a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) Haldane phase belonging to a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state. This is established by measuring generalized strange correlators introduced in this work and further confirmed by showing that the nontrivial edge state on a zigzag cut in the dimer phase is ferromagnetically ordered, resulting from effective ferromagnetic interactions between degenerate spinons generated on each side of the zigzag cut. Furthermore, we show that the ordered edge state gives rise to an extraordinary surface critical behavior at the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) bulk critical points of the model, which contradicts theoretical predictions based on classical-quantum mapping.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Edge modes of topological Mott insulators and deconfined quantum critical points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04455v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topology and anomalies lead to edge modes that can interact with critical bulk fluctuations. To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator, the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point. The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations.We also carry out calculations for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

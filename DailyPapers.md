| **[Local Limit Disorder Characteristics of Superconducting Radio Frequency Cavities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04203v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays Nb-based superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities represent fundamental tools used for (Standard Model) particle acceleration, (beyond Standard Model) particle probing, and long-lifetime photon preservation. We study the SRF frequency shift in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the quality factor mainly at low temperatures within the Dynes superconductor model. We scrutinize and use the local limit response to the external electromagnetic field. Our approach allows for a finer analysis of the peculiar behavior of the resonant frequency shift immensely close to $T_c$, observed in recent experiments. In several regimes, we analytically elaborate on the width and depth of the resulting dip. Studying the sign of the slope of the resonant frequency shift at $T_c$ in the moderately clean regime clarifies the role of the pair-breaking and pair-conserving disorder. Next, to find the relevance of our description, we compare and also fit our results with the recent experimental data from the N-doped Nb sample presented in [arXiv:2307.07905]. Our analysis complies with the experimental findings, especially concerning the dip width. We offer a straightforward, homogeneous-disorder-based interpretation within the moderately clean regime. Comparative analysis for three other cavities with different resonant frequencies reported in [arXiv:2207.14236] points towards a similar regime. Assuming the same regime at low temperatures, we address details of the high-quality plateaus. Summing all up, this work presents (and studies the limits of) the simple, effective description of the complex problem corresponding to the electromagnetic response in the superconductors, combining homogeneous conventional pairing and two different kinds of disorder scattering.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 5 appendices</p></details> |
| **[Spectroscopy of drive-induced unwanted state transitions in superconducting circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24070v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microwave drives are essential for implementing control and readout operations in superconducting quantum circuits. However, increasing the drive strength eventually leads to unwanted state transitions which limit the speed and fidelity of such operations. In this work, we systematically investigate such transitions in a fixed-frequency qubit subjected to microwave drives spanning a 9 GHz frequency range. We identify the physical origins of these transitions and classify them into three categories. (1) Resonant energy exchange with parasitic two-level systems, activated by drive-induced ac-Stark shifts, (2) multi-photon transitions to non-computational states, intrinsic to the circuit Hamiltonian, and (3) inelastic scattering processes in which the drive causes a state transition in the superconducting circuit, while transferring excess energy to a spurious electromagnetic mode or two-level system (TLS) material defect. We show that the Floquet steady-state simulation, complemented by an electromagnetic simulation of the physical device, accurately predicts the observed transitions that do not involve TLS. Our results provide a comprehensive classification of these transitions and offer mitigation strategies through informed choices of drive frequency as well as improved circuit design.</p></details> | 16 figures |
| **[Superconducting gap and its Little-Parks like oscillations with high-order harmonics in lithium intercalated 1T-TiSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23871v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting phase of doped 1T-TiSe$_2$ is a fruitful playground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena such as the anomalous metal state and spontaneously formed superconducting network. Here, we address these emergent states by studying the superconducting gap of lithium intercalated TiSe$_2$-a fundamental quantity that has remained unexplored so far. We fabricate a device that combines solid-state lateral lithium intercalation, resistance measurements and tunneling spectroscopy. We successfully probe the superconducting gap of TiSe$_2$ and reveal that the gap closing temperature well exceeds the transition temperature ($T_c$) expected from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, indicating pronounced superconducting fluctuations even in a bulk-like system. Moreover, the symmetric gap persists even in the anomalous metal state, demonstrating the particle-hole symmetry of this exotic phase directly from the density of states. Finally, the superconducting gap shows magneto-oscillations with higher harmonics, attesting to a rather regular structure of the intrinsic superconducting network.</p></details> | 25 pages,5 figures |
| **[Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23811v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step towards their application to superconducting electronics and quantum technologies. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting exchange coupling driven bistable and absolute switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23109v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As per de Gennes predictions, a superconducting layer placed between two ferromagnetic insulators can drive an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between them. Using two ferromagneticinsulating GdN layers having dissimilar switching fields sandwiching a superconducting Vanadium thin film, we demonstrate evidence of such exchange coupling. We demonstrate that such an exchange coupling promotes switching between zero and finite resistance states of Vanadium. Our devices hold either a finite resistance or a zero-resistance state at zero magnetic field, dependent on their magnetic field history. Moreover, we demonstrate the absolute switching effect, thus making such devices suitable for application at the lowest temperatures as non-volatile cryogenic memory useful for futuristic quantum circuits and for several other superconducting spintronic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the theory of supermodulation of the superconducting order parameter by supermodulation of the apex distance in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15726v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently using Scanning Josephson Tunneling Microscopy (SJTM) in the group of S\'eamus Davis a super-modulation of the superconducting order parameter induced by super-modulation of the distance $\delta$ between planar Cu and apical O was observed in [O'Mahony et al, On the electron pairing mechanism of copper-oxide high temperature superconductivity, PNAS Vol. 119(37), e2207449119 (2022)]. The authors conclude: "concurrence of prediction from strong correlation theory... with these observations indicates that... super-exchange is the electron pairing mechanism of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$." Additionally, the charge transfer energy $\mathcal{E}$, probably between O2$p_z$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ levels was studied by SJTM, too. In our current theoretical study we use LCAO approximation and Hilbert space spanned on 5 atomic orbitals: Cu$4s$, Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$, O2$p_x$, O2$p_y$, O2$p_z$. For the only super-exchange amplitude $J_{sd}$ we use the Kondo double electron exchange between Cu$4s$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and its anti-ferromagnetic sign is determined by adjacent to the copper ion in-plane oxygen orbitals. Within this approximations we have calculated: "Measured dependence of... electron-pair density $n_p$ on the displacement $\delta$ of the apical O atoms from the planar Cu atoms" on [O'Mahony et al., Fig. 5C] and obtained an excellent accuracy. We discuss that the correlation between the shape of Fermi contour and the critical temperature of optimally hole-doped cuprates can be considered as an analogue of the isotope effect of phonon superconductors. The analyzed SJTM experiment is one of the best confirmations of the [J. R\"ohler, Plane dimpling and Cu4s hybridization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, Physica B: Cond. Matt. Vol. 284-288, 1041 (2000)] idea that the hybridization of Cu$4s$ with conduction band leads to increasing of $T_c$.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 29 refs; additional clarifications related for equations for Tc in blue color</p></details> |
| **[Phase-modulated superconductivity via altermagnetism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22297v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stimulated by recent interest in altermagnets, a novel class of antiferromagnets with macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking, we investigate the coexistence of altermagnetism and superconductivity. By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under a uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. Our results indicate that the multi-sublattice structure is crucial for realizing this exotic superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring phase-modulated superconductivity without external magnetic fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 1 table and 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Coherent coupling of YBCO superconducting resonators and 100-nm-thick YIG films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22240v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cavity magnonics, magnon-photon hybridization has been widely investigated for both fundamental studies and applications. Planar superconducting resonators operating at microwave frequencies have demonstrated the possibility to achieve high couplings with magnons by exploiting the confinement of the microwave field in a reduced volume. Here we report a study of the coupling of high-Tc YBCO superconducting waveguides with 100-nm-thick YIG magnetic films. We study the evolution of mode frequencies at different temperatures and extract the coupling strength of hybrid magnon-photon modes. We show that the experimental results can be reproduced using a simple model in which the temperature dependence of the penetration depth accounts for the evolution of the polaritonic spectrum.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Vortex structure and intervortex interaction in superconducting structures with intrinsic diode effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22209v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that the intrinsic superconducting-diode effect can strongly reshape Abrikosov vortices in non-centrosymmetric superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid structures. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory accounting for the spin-orbit and exchange-field effects predicts a chiral distortion of the superfluid velocity, non-central interaction forces and resulting torque in a vortex-antivortex pair, and anisotropy of the Bean-Livingston barrier. These closed-form results are fully confirmed by time-dependent GL numerical simulations carried out with a fourth-order least-squares finite-difference solver, which captures equilibrium single vortex configuration in realistic mesoscopic geometries. The analysis shows that the cubic gradient term shifts vortex cores by an amount proportional to the in-plane exchange field and simultaneously generates a lateral torque that can rotate entire vortex ensembles, showing how spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the exchange field enable breakdown of the vortex--antivortex symmetry in a finite-size sample. By combining transparent analytics with quantitative numerics, the work provides the hallmarks of vortex physics in superconducting structures with an intrinsic diode effect and supplies concrete guidelines for designing non-reciprocal superconducting circuits, fluxonic logic elements, and kinetic-inductance devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14601v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages including Supplemental Materials, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Optimal superconductivity near a Lifshitz transition in strained (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21480v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase diagrams and two key factors to superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08682v3)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has drawn great attention. Many works have been done to study the superconductivity as well as to find more superconducting RP nickelates. However, there is a lack of general understanding regarding the key factors that contribute to the superconductivity of RP nickelates. Here, we systematically study the series of RP nickelates under doping or high-pressure conditions by means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting RP nickelates, suggesting that they are crucial to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into phase diagrams with local spin moment and local entanglement entropy as parameters, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished. At last, we predict a promising candidate for superconducting RP nickelates, which is constructed in a ``bilayer-trilayer'' stacking sequence.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Characterizing Many-body Dynamics with Projected Ensembles on a Superconducting Quantum Processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21061v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulators offer a new opportunity for the experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics, which have traditionally been characterized through expectation values or entanglement measures, based on density matrices of the system. Recently, a more general framework for studying quantum many-body systems based on projected ensembles has been introduced, revealing novel quantum phenomena, such as deep thermalization in chaotic systems. Here, we experimentally investigate a chaotic quantum many-body system using projected ensembles on a superconducting processor with 16 qubits on a square lattice. Our results provide direct evidence of deep thermalization by observing a Haar-distributed projected ensemble for the steady states within a charge-conserved sector. Moreover, by introducing an ensemble-averaged entropy as a metric, we establish a benchmark for many-body information leakage from the system to its environment. Our work paves the way for studying quantum many-body dynamics using projected ensembles and shows a potential implication for advancing quantum simulation techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>24+31...</summary><p>24+31 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Theoretical study on ambient pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films : structural analysis, model construction, and robustness of $s\pm$-wave pairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20497v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled BaBi$_3$ formed by \textit{in situ} reduction of bismuthate films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20861v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Eu metal and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, which leads to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu adlayer leads to the formation of EuO$_x$ and the superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$. The superconducting state is quasi-two-dimensional, as evidenced by the angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage characteristics. An in-plane upper critical field B$_{c2}$ significantly exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit is observed, possibly reflecting features of Ising superconductivity. The strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high-T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20842v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Pairing symmetry and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20727v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ over 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks an important step in the field of nickelate superconductors. Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally reported nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. To gain insight into the orbital feature of superconductivity, we explore the projection of different pairing bonds on Fermi surface. We find that the nodeless gap at $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, in which the latter is triggered by the former through hybridization, and both hold the same sign.</p></details> | 5 pages,4 figures |
| **[Reflection-less filter for superconducting quantum circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20645v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protecting superconducting quantum circuits from non-ideal return loss, including out-of-band circulator behavior and enhancing the performance of broadband quantum-limited amplifiers can be accomplished using a superconducting version of a special class of microwave filters known as reflection-less filters. These filters can simultaneously permit low pass band loss to preserve quantum efficiency and broad band reflection-less characteristics in the stop and pass bands. The filter also suppresses thermal photons emitted in its pass band from the termination resistors by the nature of the dual network topology. This work will review the application, theory, design, and modeling of a superconducting reflection-less filter, followed by fabrication details and the presentation of cryogenic performance measurements of a monolithic device. The filter was fabricated using Al on Si, incorporating NiCr resistors, which allows for simple integration with other superconducting quantum devices. The filter with an area of 0.6 $\mathrm{\mathbf{mm^2}}$ achieves insertion loss below 1 dB, including its connectorized package over a 80\% fractional bandwidth centered at 8 GHz, and 10 dB packaged return loss from DC to above 14.5 GHz.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published version in PRB (Regular Article): 23 Pages, 9 Figures, and 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting bistability in floating Al islands of hybrid Al/InAs nanowires](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20408v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a non-equilibrium aspect of the current-driven superconducting-normal phase transition in floating Al islands of epitaxial full-shell Al/InAs nanowires. Within a transition region discontinuous voltage jumps and hysteretic behaviour of the I-V characteristics are observed, associated with the destruction and recovery of the superconducting order parameter in the island. The strength of the two features varies strongly in different devices in a mutually correlated way and can be suppressed by a small magnetic field. Numerical calculation explains this behaviour in terms of a tiny non-equilibrium correction to the electronic energy distribution at low energies. The experiment demonstrates a critical failure of a two-temperature non-equilibrium model of the superconductor-normal transition in floating islands of hybrid nanowire devices.</p></details> |  |

| **[Combine effect of site dilution and long-range interaction on magnetic and transport properties in the half-filled Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24036v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a diluted half-filled one-band Hubbard model with second-nearest-neighbor hopping on a simple cubic lattice, aiming to explore the possibility of metallicity in diluted antiferromagnetic systems. Our semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsion strength ($U$) is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.</p></details> | 16 Pages, 11 Figs |
| **[Dynamical structure factor and a new method to measure the pairing gap in two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09685v3)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The measurement of the pairing gap plays an essential role in studying the physical properties of superconductors or superfluids. We develop a strategy for measure the pairing gap through the dynamical excitations. With the random phase approximation (RPA), the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model are studied by calculating the dynamical structure factor. Two distinct collective modes are investigated: a Goldstone phonon mode at the transferred momentum ${\bf q}=\left[0,0\right]$ and a roton mode at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$. The roton mode demonstrates a sharp molecular peak in the low-energy regime. Remarkably, the area under the roton molecular peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which persists even in three-dimensional and spin-orbit coupled (SOC) optical lattices. This result provides a potential strategy to measure the pairing gap of lattice systems experimentally by measuring the dynamical structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Due to their chemical diversity, MOFs can support a broad range of applications in chemical separations. However, the vast amount of structural compositions encoded in crystallographic information files complicates application-oriented, computational screening and design. The existing crystallographic data, therefore, requires augmentation by simulated data so that suitable descriptors for machine-learning and quantum computing tasks become available. Here, we provide extensive simulation data augmentation for MOFs within the QMOF database. We have applied a tight-binding, lattice Hamiltonian and density functional theory to MOFs for performing electronic structure calculations. Specifically, we provide a tight-binding representation of 10,000 MOFs, and an Extended Hubbard model representation for a sub-set of 240 MOFs containing transition metals, where intra-site U and inter-site V parameters are computed self-consistently. The data supports computational workflows for identifying structure-property correlations that are needed for inverse material design. For validation and reuse, we have made the data available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/tbhubbard/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/tbhubbard/</p></details> |

In order to clarify the structural, spectroscopic and theoretical details of that evolution, here we present ARPES data supplementing morphology and scanning tunneling measurements. These combined experimental results are compared with predictions from a variety of electronic structure approaches, mostly density functional DFT+U, but not neglecting Mott-Hubbard models, both ordered and disordered. These theoretical pictures address different spectroscopic aspects, including the 2D Fermi surface, the Hubbard bands, etc. While no single picture account for all observations at once,the emergent hypothesis compatible with all data is that metallization arises from sub-subsurface boron doping, additional to the main standard subsurface boron geometry, that would leave the surface insulating. These results advance the indispensable frame for the further understanding of this fascinating system.</p></details> | 20 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold atoms using Fermi-Hubbard models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06768v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

Using this concept, we prove that local electron correlations in the Hubbard model are fully classical: in the natural basis the local reduced density matrix is separable and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. Our results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and the nonlocal correlations with its quantum environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + references | 3 figures | Comments welcome!</p></details> |

Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Dynamic Competition Between Hubbard and Superexchange Interactions Selectively Localizes Electrons and Holes Through Polarons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00770v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling the effects of photoexcited polarons in transition metal oxides can enable the long timescale charge separation necessary for renewable energy applications as well as controlling new quantum phases through dynamically tunable electron-phonon coupling. In previously studied transition metal oxides, polaron formation is facilitated by a photoexcited ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). When the polaron is formed, oxygen atoms move away from iron centers, which increases carrier localization at the metal center and decreases charge hopping. Studies of yttrium iron garnet and erbium iron oxide have suggested that strong electron and spin correlations can modulate photoexcited polaron formation. To understand the interplay between strong spin and electronic correlations in highly polar materials, we studied gadolinium iron oxide (GdFeO3), which selectively forms photoexcited polarons through an Fe-O-Fe superexchange inter-action. Excitation-wavelength-dependent transient extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy selectively excites LMCT and metal-to-metal charge transfer transitions (MMCT). The LMCT transition suppresses photoexcited polaron formation due to the balance between superexchange and Hubbard interactions, while MMCT transitions result in photoexcited polaron formation within 250+/-40 fs. Ab initio theory demonstrates that electron and hole polarons localize on iron centers following MMCT. In addition to understanding how strong electronic and spin correlations can control strong electron-phonon coupling, these experiments separately measure electron and hole polaron interactions on neighboring metal centers for the first time, providing insight into a large range of charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard insulators.</p></details> | 29 pages, 17 figures |

Our dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) study reveals that the introduction of PHA in the model significantly influences the critical temperature ($T_c$) and interaction strength ($U_c$), as well as the size of the co-existence region of metallic and insulating phases at low temperatures. Specifically, as the system is moved away from particle-hole symmetry, $T_c$ decreases and $U_c$ increases, indicating a suppression of the insulating phase and the strengthening of the metallic behavior. Additionally, the first-order transition line between metallic and insulating phases is better defined in the model with PHA, leading to a reduced co-existence region at $T<T_c$. Moreover, we propose that the MIT can be characterized by the charge density, which serves as a viable alternative to zero-frequency spectral density typically used in DMFT calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the role of particle-hole asymmetry in the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the MIT even in a very simple system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version. 11 pages, 5 figures.

Our update amounts to adding a test which reliably checks the thermodynamic stability of solutions of Hartree--Fock equations. This stability test makes it possible to detect, by simple means and with certainty, regions in phase space where the model exhibits mixed phases where two conventional phases coexist and translation invariance is broken in complicated ways; in such a mixed phase, unconventional physics is to be expected. Our results show that mixed phases are ubiquitous in Hubbard-like models in arbitrary dimensions.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Rev. Lett. 132, 263402 (2024)] and shown to describe altermagnetism that can be studied in cold atom systems. Using an updated Hartree--Fock method that can detect instabilities towards phase separation, we show that the model is in a mixed phase in large parts of the parameter regime at half-filling. We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures.

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

In this work we study the Mott insulating phases of the SU(3) Hubbard model at 1/3-filling using infinite projected entangled-pair states, optimized with both imaginary time evolution and variational optimization. In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |

Since lattice dynamical properties are closely linked to electronic structures, the Hubbard-corrected density functional perturbation theory (DFPT+$U$) can calculate them at the same level of accuracy. To investigate the effects of $U$ on electron-phonon (el-ph) interactions, we implemented DFPT+$U$ with a Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism to determine $U$ self-consistently and applied our method to compute optical and transport properties of transparent conductive oxides of CdO and ZnO. For CdO, we find that opening a band gap due to $U$ restores the long-range Fr\"ohlich interaction and that its calculated mobility and absorption spectrum are in excellent agreement with experiments. For ZnO where a band gap already appears at the DFT level, DFPT+$U$ brings the results into much closer alignment with experiment, thus demonstrating improved accuracy of our method in dealing with el-ph interactions in these technologically important materials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

In this article, we propose a theoretical scheme to construct a time-dependent rank-2 tensor electric field by introducing a periodically driving quadratic potential in a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, and investigate the dynamics of dipole and fracton excitations when the drive frequency is resonant with the on-site interaction. We find that the dynamics are dominated by the splitting of large dipoles with the photon-assisted correlated tunneling and the movement of small dipoles, both of which can be well controlled by the drive amplitude. Our work provides a possible approach for engineering the dynamics of dipole-conserving quantum systems via tensor gauge fields.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.</p></details> | 10 pages, 21 figures |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |

However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario.

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system.

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule. These results suggest that the normal state of La3Ni2O7 to be a multiband metallic nature.</p></details> |  |

One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</p></details> |  |

We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally reported nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. To gain insight into the orbital feature of superconductivity, we explore the projection of different pairing bonds on Fermi surface. We find that the nodeless gap at $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, in which the latter is triggered by the former through hybridization, and both hold the same sign.</p></details> | 5 pages,4 figures |
| **[Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19501v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We conduct first-principles simulations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a nickelate in which a recent series of experiments found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the hydrostatic pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in effective on-site repulsion in the maximally localized Wannier functions comprising the Ni 3$d$ $e_g$ bands crossing the Fermi energy, as determined by density functional theory. We attribute this increase to reduced screening by the spacer La 5$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ bands -- an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electron correlations. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we leverage intrinsic chemical pressure by applying the methodology to Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to a unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetically ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest a simultaneous formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ , thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) (HTSC) in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with critical temperature $T_c$ higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has aroused a surge in the exploration of HTSC in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase multilayer nickelates. Very recently, SC is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ substrate with $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40\text{ K}$) at ambient pressure (AP), allowing various experimental investigation on the pairing mechanism in this material. It is now eager to enhance the $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Here we propose that an imposed strong perpendicular electric field can strongly enhance the $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. The physics underlying this proposal is clear and simple. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this layer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly enhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study and comprehensive two-orbital one under the mean-field treatment and the density matrix renormalization group approach consistently verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers is enough to realize HTSC with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p></details> |  |

More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors. This work lays the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical investigations into the unique electronic properties of these emerging materials.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures and appendix</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Under Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06450v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity (SC) in the trilayer nickelate compound La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has generated significant interest. In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incommensurate spin-fluctuations and competing pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05254v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we use dynamical mean-field theory to provide a coherent understanding of the electronic correlations shaping the twisted WSe$_2$ phase diagram. We find a correlated metal competing with three distinct site-polarized correlated insulators; the competition is controlled by interlayer potential difference and interaction strength. The insulators are characterized by a strong differentiation between orbitals with respect to carrier concentration and effective correlation strength. Upon doping, a strong particle-hole asymmetry emerges, resulting from a Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen-type charge-transfer mechanism. The associated charge-transfer physics and proximity to a van Hove singularity in the correlated metal sandwiched between two site-polarized insulators naturally explains the interlayer potential-driven metal-to-insulator transition, particle-hole asymmetry in transport, and the coherence-incoherence crossover in $3.65^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer and tri-layer of WSe$_2$ are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials.</p></details> |  |

This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Our first-principles and symmetry-based analysis reveal that interlayer stacking symmetry plays a central role in determining the nature of electron-hole pairs. We uncover a rich variety of excitonic states, including spatially confined two-dimensional (2D) excitons, delocalized three-dimensional (3D) excitons, and charge-transfer (CT) excitons with interlayer character. The dimensionality and optical activity of these excitons are governed by the interplay among orbital character, interlayer hybridization, and symmetry-imposed selection rules. Our findings establish general principles for engineering excitonic properties in van der Waals heterostructures through controlled layer orientation and stacking order.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$), in particular, has emerged as a promising solar cell absorber. However, defective metal-semiconductor interfaces have restricted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to approximately 6%. Here we report WSe$_2$ photovoltaics with a record-high PCE of approximately 11% enabled by ultra-clean indium/gold (In/Au) van der Waals (vdW) contacts. Using grid-patterned top vdW electrodes, we demonstrate near-ideal diodes with a record-high on/off ratio of $1.0\times 10^9$. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 571 +/- 9 mV, record-high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 27.19 +/- 0.45 mA cm$^{-2}$ -- approaching the theoretical limit (34.5 mA cm$^{-2}$) -- and fill factor of 69.2 +/- 0.7% resulting in PCE of 10.8 +/- 0.2% under 1-Sun illumination on large active area (approximately 0.13x0.13 mm$^2$) devices have been realised. The excellent device performance is consistent with the high external quantum efficiency (up to approximately 93%) measured across a broad spectral range of 500-830 nm.

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

However, current ab initio approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe$_2$, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s-4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Harnessing their full potential requires understanding both intrinsic transport and the dynamics of optically excited spin and charge carriers -- particularly the transition between excited spin polarization and the conduction band's intrinsic spin texture. Here, we investigate the spin polarization of the conduction bands of bulk WSe$_2$ using static and time-resolved spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, complemented by photocurrent calculations. Electron doping reveals the intrinsic spin polarization, while time-resolved measurements trace the evolution of excited spin carriers. We find that intervalley scattering is spin-conserving, with spin transport initially governed by photoexcited carriers and aligning with the intrinsic conduction band polarization after $\sim$150 fs.</p></details> |  |

This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures.

We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.</p></details> |  |

The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

Here, we demonstrate that exposing WSe$_2$ to chloroform provides simple and stable p-type doping. In monolayer WSe$_2$ transistors with Pd contacts, chloroform increases the maximum hole current by over 100$\times$ (>200 $\mu$A/$\mu$m), reduces $R_\textrm{C}$ to ~2.5 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m, and retains an on/off ratio of $10^{10}$ at room temperature. These improvements persist for over 8 months, survive annealing above 150 {\deg}C, and remain effective down to 10 K, enabling a cryogenic $R_\textrm{C}$ of ~1 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Density functional theory indicates that chloroform strongly physisorbs to WSe$_2$, inducing hole doping with minimal impact on the electronic states between the valence band and conduction band edges. Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy reveal that chloroform intercalates at the WSe$_2$ interface with the gate oxide, contributing to doping stability and mitigating interfacial dielectric disorder. This robust, scalable approach enables high-yield WSe$_2$ transistors with good p-type performance.</p></details> |  |

However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Accompanying the superconductivity and a correlated insulator phase is the Kondo-lattice-like phenomenology in transport properties. Here we consider how such phenomenology can develop when the combination of the active bands are topological. We advance a unique construction of compact molecular orbitals through a partial Wannierization that is symmetry preserving. The resulting Anderson lattice model provides the basis for a microscopic understanding of the experimental observation, including the involved energy scales.

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |

Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Observing Laughlin's pump using quantized edge states in graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21271v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous mass inversion enriched quantum anomalous Hall states in multilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13229v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG), both QAH states with Chern number $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state, as well as the topological phase transition from $C = -3$ to $C = -5$ state in RPG, arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism driven by the interplay between trigonal warping, staggered layer order, and the displacement field: Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands of RPG into a central touching point and three satellite Dirac cones. Meanwhile, the coexistence of the staggered layer order and displacement field induces a momentum-dependent effective mass in the low-energy bands. Consequently, mass inversions at the central touching point and the satellite Dirac cones, induced by an increasing displacement field, can occur asynchronously, leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state and the topological phase transition from QAH state with $C=-3$ to $C=-5$. Additionally, based on this mechanism, we predict the presence of a $C=3$ QAH state in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene (RTG), which can be detected experimentally. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal tetralayer graphene (BTG), explaining the origin of the observed $C=6$ QAH state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Valley resolved optical spectroscopy and coherent excitation of quantum Hall edge states in graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19654v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that chiral edge states in graphene under Quantum Hall effect conditions can be selectively probed and excited by terahertz or infrared radiation with single-quasiparticle sensitivity without affecting bulk states. Moreover, valley-selective excitation of edge states is possible with high fidelity. The underlying physical mechanism is the inevitable violation of adiabaticity and inversion symmetry breaking for electron states near the edge. This leads to the formation of Landau level-specific and valley-specific absorbance spectral peaks that are spectrally well separated from each other and from absorption by the bulk states, and have different polarization selection rules. Furthermore, inversion symmetry breaking enables coherent driving of chiral edge photocurrents due to second-order nonlinear optical rectification which becomes allowed in the electric dipole approximation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Sub-nm Curvature Unlocks Quantum Flexoelectricity in Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21996v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flexoelectricity, polarization induced by strain gradients, is especially pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to mechanical deformation. In nanostructures with sub-nm curvature, this effect is governed by quantum-mechanical polarization and electrostatic modulation, not merely classical lattice distortion. Here, we present the first direct experimental and theoretical demonstration of large intrinsic quantum flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles, exhibiting polarization densities (P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}) that exceed those of mesoscale systems by 5 to 7 orders of magnitude. These nanowrinkles, with sub-nm radii of curvature at their apex, undergo atomic-level buckling and result in localized strain fields, as confirmed by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy. These curvatures create an asymmetry to {\pi}-orbital interactions across the atomic layer, which, in turn, leads to localized polarization densities. Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals curvature-dependent work function shifts consistent with flexoelectric polarization, while conductive atomic force microscopy detects reproducible flexoelectric currents exhibiting a threshold voltage ({\Phi}th ~1 V) that matches the band offset predicted by ab initio calculations (~1.2 V). Together, these results confirm how flexoelectric dipoles reshape the local electronic potential. Graphene nanowrinkles thus provide a pristine platform for uncovering quantum-mechanical flexoelectricity: a fundamentally ubiquitous effect, whose study in the simplest crystalline material can illuminate electromechanical behavior across condensed matter, soft matter, and biological systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 main figures, 12 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[All-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02497v5)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an all-electrical setup to generate valley polarization in graphene. A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wavevector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--P\'erot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene increases conductance near the Dirac point but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages. 7+2 figures</p></details> |

Perhaps the simplest example is Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG) encapsulated by a layered magnet from one side and a strong spin-orbit material from the other. Taking WS$_2$/BBG/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as a representative ex-so-tronic device, we employ realistic \emph{ab initio}-inspired Hamiltonians and effective electron-electron interactions to investigate the emergence of correlated phases within the random phase approximation. We find that for a given doping level, exchange and spin-orbit coupling induced Stoner and intervalley coherence instabilities can be swapped, allowing to explore the full spectrum of correlated phases within a single device.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effect of Berry connection on attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in gapped graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19286v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in gapped graphene by numerically solving the four-band density matrix equations. Our results reveal that, in contrast to pristine graphene, whose fishbone-shaped spectra oscillate at twice the pump laser frequency, the ATAS of gapped graphene exhibits an additional component oscillating at the pump laser frequency, induced by the Berry connection. To gain insight into these interesting results, we employ a simplified model to derive an analytical expression for the spectral component stemming from the Berry connection. Our analytical results qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the numerical simulations, revealing that the intensity of the fundamental-frequency spectral component depends not only on the Berry connection but also on the energy shifts associated with the effective mass of electrons at the van Hove singularities. These results shed light on the complex generation mechanism of the ATAS in symmetry-broken materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent Graphene-Superconductor Interfaces: Quantum Hall and Zero Field Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13307v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study clean, edge-contacted graphene/superconductor interfaces in both the quantum Hall (QH) and zero field regimes. We find that Andreev reflection is substantially stronger than at an interface with a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas: the large velocity at graphene's conical Dirac points makes the requirement of current continuity to a metal much less restrictive. In both our tight-binding and continuum models, we find a wide range of parameters for which Andreev reflection is strong. For a transparent interface, we demonstrate the following for graphene in the lowest Landau level QH state: (i) Excellent electron-hole hybridization occurs: the electron and hole components in graphene are simply related by an exchange of sublattice. The spatial profile for the electron component is predominantly gaussian on one sublattice and peaked at the interface, and so very different from the QH edge state of a terminated lattice. (ii) The degree of hybridization is independent of the graphene filling: no fine-tuning is needed. (iii) The spectrum is valley degenerate: the dispersion of each chiral Andreev edge mode (CAEM) self-aligns to be antisymmetric about the center of each valley, independent of filling. Achieving a transparent interface requires the absence of any barrier as well as a superconductor that is suitably matched to graphene; we argue that the latter condition is not very stringent. We further consider the effect of reduced transparency and Zeeman splitting on both the wavefunctions of the CAEM and their dispersion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Phys.

Here, we introduce a general strategy for engineering heavy fermions in incommensurate van der Waals heterostructures by coupling a Mott insulator (Nb$_3$Cl$_8$) with itinerant electrons (from monolayer graphene), circumventing strict lattice-matching requirements. Through magnetotransport and slave spin mean-field calculations, we demonstrate the hybridization gap ($\Delta\approx30$ meV), gate-tunable metal-insulator transition, and band-selective electron effective mass enhancement, hallmarks of Kondo coherence. The heterostructure exhibits nearly order-of-magnitude electron effective mass dichotomy between hybridized and conventional graphene-like regimes, alongside in-plane magnetic field-induced metal-insulator transitions. Top gate-temperature phase mapping reveals competing correlated states, including insulating and hidden-order phases. This work establishes a scalable platform for designing heavy fermion by replacing the itinerant electron materials, with implications for engineering topological superconductivity and quantum criticality in low-dimensional systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

These experiments revealed a surprising non-monotonic current pattern as a function of the TBG rotation angle $\theta$, with a peak at $\theta \approx 5^\circ$, a finding that markedly departs from the well-known magic angle TBG behavior. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework. Our calculations, performed on both relaxed and rigid TBG structures, simulate contact conductance by analyzing the local density of states across a range of biases and rotational angles. Contrary to the current interpretation, our results demonstrate that the maximum conductance at $\theta \approx 5^{\rm o}$ is not caused by structural relaxation or AA stacking zone changes. Instead, we attribute this peak to the evolution of the electronic band structure, specifically the shifting of van Hove singularities (vHs) to the Fermi level as the twist angle decreases. We further show that the precise location of this conductance maximum is dependent on the applied bias voltage. This interplay between twist angle, bias, and vHs energy provides a robust explanation for the experimental findings.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</p></details> |  |

Yet, no existing methods enable simultaneous nanoscale mapping of both temperatures at cryogenic conditions. Here, we introduce a scanning probe technique that images the local lattice temperature and extracts electron temperature at gate-defined p-n junctions in graphene. By applying an alternating electrical current and analyzing first- and second-harmonic responses, we disentangle Joule heating from the Peltier effect-the latter encoding the local electron temperature. This enables the first spatially resolved cryogenic imaging of both phenomena in graphene. Even under modest current bias, the electron temperature increases by nearly three orders of magnitude more than the lattice temperature, revealing strong electron-phonon decoupling and indicating a previously unrecognized electron cooling pathway. Our minimally invasive method is broadly applicable to van der Waals heterostructures and opens new avenues for probing energy dissipation and non-equilibrium transport in correlated and hydrodynamic electron systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 4 main figures, 8 extended data figures</p></details> |

By achieving ultra-strong coupling between a terahertz resonator and mesoscopic graphene, we demonstrate that cavity vacuum fields can alter the effective degeneracies of Landau levels, resulting in a nonlinear Landau fan diagram for massless Dirac fermions while preserving quantum-Hall quantization. Specifically, by leveraging graphene's gate-tunability, we observe that quantum-Hall features, minimum longitudinal and quantized Hall conductance for a given filling factor, occur at carrier densities reduced by more than 20 percent compared to systems without cavity. Theoretical analysis attributes this effect to the virtual cavity photon mediated transitions between the non-equidistant Landau levels in graphene, significantly reducing their effective degeneracy. This study paves the way for investigating cavity quantum electrodynamics in highly tunable, atomically thin two-dimensional crystals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules.

We explore ring disorder in the sp2 carbon, and functional impurities such as oxides (-O), and hydroxides (-OH) that are common in coal-derived graphene. The electronic density of states analysis revealed localized states near the Fermi level, with functional groups contributing predominantly to states below the Fermi level, while carbon atoms in non-hexagonal rings contributed mainly to states above it. The functionalization of graphene induces charge localization while ring disorder disrupts the continuous flow of electrons. By projecting the electronic conductivity along specific spatial directions, we find that both the crystal orientation and the graphene purity significantly influence the anisotropy and magnitude of electronic transport in the composites. This study implicitly highlights the importance of structural stress to obtain improved electrical conductivity in such composites.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Interacting Energy Bands of Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene Revealed by the Quantum Twisting Microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20738v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electron interactions in quantum materials fundamentally shape their energy bands and, with them, the material's most intriguing quantum phases. Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has emerged as a model system, where flat bands give rise to a variety of such phases, yet the precise nature of these bands has remained elusive due to the lack of high-resolution momentum space probes. Here, we use the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) to directly image the interacting energy bands of MATBG with unprecedented momentum and energy resolution. Away from the magic angle, the observed bands closely follow the single-particle theory. At the magic angle, however, we observe bands that are completely transformed by interactions, exhibiting light and heavy electronic character at different parts of momentum space. Upon doping, the interplay between these light and heavy components gives rise to a variety of striking phenomena, including interaction-induced bandwidth renormalization, Mott-like cascades of the heavy particles, and Dirac revivals of the light particles. We also uncover a persistent low-energy excitation tied to the heavy sector, suggesting a new unaccounted degree of freedom. These results resolve the long-standing puzzle in MATBG - the dual nature of its electrons - by showing that it originates from electrons at different momenta within the same topological heavy fermion-like flat bands. More broadly, our results establish the QTM as a powerful tool for high-resolution spectroscopic studies of quantum materials previously inaccessible to conventional techniques.</p></details> |  |

The interplay between the band gap created by the band folding of the interfacial potential and the band inversion driven by enhanced spin-orbit interaction (SOI) through band hybridization enables us to realize a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D-TI). Here we report the realization of graphene 2D-TIs by epitaxial growth of three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) BiSbTeSe$_2$ ultrathin films on graphene. By increasing the BiSbTeSe$_2$ thickness from 2 nm to 9 nm to enhance SOI on graphene, the electronic state is altered from the trivial Kekul${\'e}$ insulator to the 2D-TI. The nonlocal transport reveals the helical edge conduction which survives up to 200 K at maximum. Our graphene 2D-TI is stable, easy to make electrical contacts, and of high quality.

Such modifications cannot be explained by electron irradiation alone. Instead, tritiation, caused by the tritium radicals remaining after the decay, is the primary effect causing the modification of the graphene surface, as confirmed by confocal Raman spectroscopy. The effect of the interaction of tritium atoms with the graphene surface exceeds that of electron irradiation at the average energy of the beta particles (5.7 keV). Compared to previously investigated high electron doses in the absence of tritium, remarkably low concentrations of tritium already induce a significant amount of sp3- and vacancy-type defects at short exposure times. Our findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations of graphene bombardment with tritium atoms. As a consequence, tritium saturation of graphene may alter its permeability for hydrogen isotopes, thus affecting potential applications.</p></details> |  |

This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we study the quantum dot energy levels with approximate equations and compare them with the exact levels. The starting point of our approach is the four-component continuum model and the quantum dot is defined by a continuous potential well in a uniform magnetic field. Using some simple arguments we demonstrate realistic regimes where approximate quantum dot equations can be derived. Interestingly these approximate equations can be solved semi-analytically, in the same context as a single-component Schr\"odinger equation. The approximate equations provide valuable insight into the physics with minimal numerical effort compared with the four-component quantum dot model. We show that the approximate quantum dot energy levels agree very well with the exact levels in a broad range of parameters and find realistic regimes where the relative error is vanishingly small.</p></details> |  |

The NATT scheme, by construction, automatically searches for a tree structure that best fits a given discrete dataset whose features serve as inputs, and has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 17 figures |

In particular, hybrid tree tensor networks (HTTNs) are very useful for simulating larger systems beyond the available size of the quantum hardware. However, while the realistic quantum states in NISQ hardware are highly likely to be noisy, this framework is formulated for pure states. In this work, as well as discussing the relevant methods, i.e., Deep VQE and entanglement forging under the framework of HTTNs, we investigate the noisy HTN states by introducing the expansion operator for providing the description of the expansion of the size of simulated quantum systems and the noise propagation. This framework enables the general tree HTN states to be explicitly represented and their physicality to be discussed. We also show that the expectation value of a measured observable exponentially vanishes with the number of contracted quantum tensors. Our work will lead to providing the noise-resilient construction of HTN states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Subst...</summary><p>Substantially updated version. 38 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we extend the max-flow min-cut theorem to a relation among different \emph{partial orders} on the set of vertices of a network and introduce a new partial order for the vertices based on the \emph{min-cut structure} of the network. We apply the extended max-flow min-cut theorem to random tensor networks and find that the \emph{finite correction} to the entanglement R\'enyi entropy arising from the degeneracy of the min-cuts is given by the number of \emph{order morphisms} from the min-cut partial order to the partial order induced by non-crossing partitions on the symmetric group. Moreover, we show that the number of order morphisms corresponds to moments of a graph-dependent measure which generalizes the free Bessel law in some special cases in free probability theory.</p></details> |  |

We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>JC an...</summary><p>JC and PI contributed equally</p></details> |

This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |

We first develop a novel HHL in the qudits formalism, the generalization of qubits, and then transform its operations into an equivalent classical HHL, taking advantage of the non-unitary operations that they can apply. The main novelty of this proposal is to perform a classical simulation as efficiently as possible of the HHL to benchmark the algorithm steps according to its input parameters and the input matrix. We apply this algorithm to three simulation problems, comparing it with an exact inversion algorithm, and we compare its performance against an implementation of the original HHL simulated in the Qiskit framework, providing both codes. Our results show that our approach can achieve a promising performance in computational efficiency to simulate HHL process without quantum noise, providing a lower bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, improved version including code</p></details> |

Tensor network states are one of the workhorses to compute ground states of many-body systems, yet the accurate computation of excited eigenstates is still challenging. Here, we develop a combination of the inexact Lanczos method, which aims at efficiently computing excited states, to tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 84 states in different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin Seebeck Effect of Triangular-lattice Spin Supersolid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22414v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using our developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling of normalized spin current $\tilde{I}_S$ through the interface, and benchmark our approach on 1D Heisenberg chain, with the negative spinon spin current reproduced. In addition, we find an algebraic scaling $\tilde{I}_S \sim T^{\alpha}$ with varying exponent $\alpha$ in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with characteristic spin-current signatures distinguishing different magnetic phases. Remarkably, we discover a persistent spin current $\tilde{I}_S$ in the spin supersolid phase, which saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $\tilde{I}_S \sim T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence in SSE - provide sensitive experimental probes for investigating spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Moreover, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.</p></details> | 19 pages, 12 figures |

By bounding the motion of these confined anyons, we obtain dipolar excitations with restricted mobility. We analyze the resulting logical operators, whose existence depends on the system size, as well as the structure of gapped boundaries and a tensor network representation of the ground state. Furthermore, when confinement is enforced in both directions, fractal-like excitations emerge, resulting in unpaired logical operators. We extend our construction to 3D models, such as the surface code and the X-cube model, leading to novel dipole-loop and dipole-planon excitations that arise from bounding confined excitations. These modifications are implemented through group cohomological twistings--projective representations of finite groups--with most examples based on Z2xZ2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments are welcome!</p></details> |

In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</p></details> |  |

However, high circuit depths remain a limiting factor on near-term quantum hardware. We present a compilation algorithm based on Matrix Product Operators for generating compressed circuits enabling real-time simulation on digital quantum computers, that for a given depth are more accurate than all Trotterizations of the same depth. By the efficient use of environment tensors, the algorithm is scalable in depth beyond prior work, and we present circuit compilations of up to 64 layers of $SU(4)$ gates. Surpassing only 1D circuits, our approach can flexibly target a particular quasi-2D gate topology. We demonstrate this by compiling a 52-qubit 2D Transverse-Field Ising propagator onto the IBM Heavy-Hex topology. For all circuit depths and widths tested, we produce circuits with smaller errors than all equivalent depth Trotter unitaries, corresponding to reductions in error by up to 4 orders of magnitude and circuit depth compressions with a factor of over 6.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+1 p...</summary><p>9+1 pages, 6 figures; updating with Quantum template</p></details> |

While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light, offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks. This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings, technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols. These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale, high-speed quantum-secure networks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages + appendices, 21 figures.

However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such triple-layer networks, which reduces the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(D^{12})$ in conventional methods to $\mathcal{O}(D^{9})$. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, while also providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |

The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures + 7 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Our result assumes the existence of a `good' approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a crucial ingredient in previous area-law proofs. Such approximations have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and 2D frustration-free locally-gapped Hamiltonians. As a corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and any bi-partition $L\cup L^c$ of the system, \begin{align*} \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} \le \mathrm O \big( \log (|L|\log(d))+\log(1/\varepsilon)\big), \end{align*} where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$, $d$ is the dimension of a site and $ \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} $ represents the $\varepsilon$-\emph{smoothed maximum mutual information} with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition in $\Omega$. From this bound we then conclude $\mathrm I (L:L^c)_\Omega \le \mathrm O\big(\log(|L|\log(d))\big)$ -- an area law for the mutual information in 1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show that $\Omega$ can be approximated in trace norm up to $\varepsilon$ with a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\mathrm{poly}(|L|/\varepsilon)$, leading to a good MPO approximation for $\Omega$ with polynomial bond dimension. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local Hamiltonians.</p></details> | 38 pages, version 2 |
| **[Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures |

We find instead that the true low-temperature state is a quantum spin Hall insulator for intermediate values of the sub-lattice potential $\lambda_v$ and large on-site repulsion. Two kinds of magnetic fluctuations are found to compete: $z$- and $xy$-AFM. The latter dominates at low temperature leading to a stabilization of the quantum spin Hall state as opposed to $z-$AFM Chern insulator. Our work is consistent with the robust quantum spin Hall effects which are consistently observed at even-integer fillings over a wide range of parameters in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ as well as AB stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$.</p></details> |  |

The workflow operates within an accelerated quantum supercomputing environment with the IonQ Forte quantum computer and NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon Web Services. We present several algorithmic innovations and an efficient GPU-accelerated execution, which achieves a several orders of magnitude speedup over the state-of-the-art implementation of QC-AFQMC. We apply the algorithm to simulate the oxidative addition step of the nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura reaction using 24 qubits of IonQ Forte with 16 qubits used to represent the trial state, plus 8 additional ancilla qubits for error mitigation, resulting in the largest QC-AFQMC with matchgate shadow experiments ever performed on quantum hardware. We achieve a $9\times$ speedup in collecting matchgate circuit measurements, and our distributed-parallel post-processing implementation attains a $656\times$ time-to-solution improvement over the prior state-of-the-art. Chemical reaction barriers for the model reaction evaluated with active-space QC-AFQMC are within the uncertainty interval of $\pm4$ kcal/mol from the reference CCSD(T) result when matchgates are sampled on the ideal simulator and within 10 kcal/mol from reference when measured on QPU.

| **[Intrinsic Thermal Hall Effect in Mott Insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14863v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In light of recent experimental data indicating a substantial thermal Hall effect in square lattice antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, we investigate whether a simple Mott insulator can sustain a finite thermal Hall effect. We verify that the answer is "no" if one performs calculations within a spin-only low-energy effective spin model with non-interacting magnons. However, by performing determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show the single-band $t$-$t'$-$U$ Hubbard model coupled to an orbital magnetic field does support a finite thermal Hall effect when $t' \neq 0$ and $B \neq 0$ in the Mott insulating phase. We argue that the (carrier agnostic) necessary conditions for observing a finite thermal Hall effect are time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry breaking. By considering magnon-magnon scattering using a semi-classical Boltzmann analysis, we illustrate a physical mechanism by which finite transverse thermal conductivity may arise, consistent with our symmetry argument and numerical results. Our results contradict the conventional wisdom that square and triangular lattices with SU(2) symmetry do not support a finite thermal Hall effect and call for a critical re-examination of thermal Hall effect data in insulating magnets, as the magnon contribution should not be excluded a priori.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+23 ...</summary><p>6+23 pages, 3+11 figures</p></details> |

In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n$-Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo method arises for the double occupancy as well as qualitative agreement for the filling and compressibility across the Mott transition. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model as a useful alternative perspective for studying strong correlations in SU($N$) systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06681v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 8 figures, article</p></details> |
| **[Monte Carlo Study of Critical Fermi Surface with Spatially Disordered Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13858v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Fermi liquids are an important topic in condensed matter physics, as their characteristics challenge the framework of traditional Fermi liquid theory and reveal the complex behavior of electrons in strongly interacting systems. Despite some progress in this field, linear-in-temperature resistivity and inverse-in-frequency tail of optical conductivity are unresolved issues in non-Fermi liquids. Both the experimentally observed smeared region and the theoretically predicted marginal Fermi liquid suggest that spatial disorder seems to be an important driver of these phenomena. By performing large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations in the ferromagnetic spin-fermion model at finite $N$, beyond the large-$N$ used in previous theoretical work, we investigated the role of spatial disorder in the critical Fermi surface (FS) of this model. We proposed a corrected theory of our system, which is based on a modified Eliashberg theory and a universal theory of strange metals. This theory agrees well with the data obtained from DQMC, particularly in capturing the $\omega \ln \omega$ type self-energy characteristic of marginal Fermi liquid behavior, though temperature limitations prevent us from observing the linear-in-temperature scattering rate. Our findings offer strong and unbiased validation of the universal theory of strange metals, broaden the applicability of the modified Eliashberg theory, and provide insights for numerically searching for marginal Fermi liquid and linear-in-temperature resistivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic excitations of a trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19716v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the squared sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the linear spin wave theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Pairing phase diagram for electron-doped cuprates in the square-lattice $t-U-V$ Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07079v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Non-degenerate Ground State of the Spin-Boson Model under Abelian Diagonalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14818v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudocriticality in antiferromagnetic spin chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16424v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely slow flows ("walking behavior") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$. We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$ along with an improved loop estimator for the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region $N>2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a complex CFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+11 ...</summary><p>4+11 pages, 3+7 figures</p></details> |

Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures.

| **[Kinetic magnetism in the crossover between the square and triangular lattice Fermi-Hubbard models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15669v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[The interplay of phase fluctuations and nodal quasiparticles: ubiquitous Fermi arcs in two-dimensional d-wave superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05376v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose that the pseudogap and Fermi arcs can universally emerge due to thermal (static) phase fluctuations in the normal state of 2D nodal superconductors. By considering a minimal phenomenological model with spatially fluctuating superconducting pairings, we theoretically investigate the role of superconducting phase fluctuations in generic 2D superconductors with disorder-average technique. It is shown for nodal d-wave superconductors that phase fluctuations mediate the scattering of d-wave quasiparticles, smearing out the nodal quasiparticle gap and further leading to pseudogap and Fermi arcs. Moreover, the evolution of Fermi arcs is quantitatively described by two emergent characteristic length scales of the system: one is the finite superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)$, and another the nodal BCS coherence length $\xi_\text{BCS}(k)$. To support our theoretical findings, we numerically report the observation of Fermi arcs in a Hubbard-like model, proposed originally by X. Y. Xu and T. Grover in Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{126}$, 217002 (2021), with sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations. As far as we noticed, it is the first time in a correlated model that Fermi arcs are identified with unbiased simulations. The numerical results for the scattering rate $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ of Cooper pairs exhibit excellent agreements with our theoretical predictions, where $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ is expected to scale linearly with the inverse superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)^{-1}$. This convergence of theory and numerics thereby strongly validates the universal connection between phase fluctuations and Fermi arcs in 2D nodal superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures for the main text; 9 pages, 5 figures for the supplementary material</p></details> |

In this work we study the Mott insulating phases of the SU(3) Hubbard model at 1/3-filling using infinite projected entangled-pair states, optimized with both imaginary time evolution and variational optimization. In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

We combine quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the recently proposed eigenstate-to-Hamiltonian construction, which maps the ground state of a specified parent Hamiltonian to a single non-ergodic excited state of a new derived Hamiltonian. This engineered Hamiltonian contains non-trivial, systematically-obtained, and emergent features that are responsible for its non-ergodic properties. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to quantum many-body scar states where we discover a previously unreported family of Hamiltonians with spatially oscillating spin exchange couplings that host scar-like properties, including revivals in the quantum dynamics, and towers in the inverse participation ratio; and to many-body localization, where we find a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with correlated disorder that exhibits non-ergodic scaling of the participation entropy and inverse participation ratios of order unity. The method can be applied to other known ground states to discover new quantum many-body systems with non-ergodic excited states.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, including the appendix</p></details> |

However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement R\'enyi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Remarkably, it was also recently realized that shielded polar molecules exhibit an SU(N) symmetry among their hyperfine states, opening the door to SU(N) systems with larger N, bosonic particle statistics, and tunable interactions -- both repulsive and attractive. Motivated by these results, we have studied the SU(3) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on a square lattice. Using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method, we explore the finite-temperature phase diagram and provide evidence for three distinct regions -- a three-component Fermi liquid (FL) region, a "trion" liquid (TL) region, and an ordered Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW phase is stable at finite temperature (in contrast to the SU(2) CDW), while the FL to TL crossover appears to point to a quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Our method extends straightforwardly to larger N and is sign-problem free for even values of N. With these results, we demonstrate the potential physics enabled by using polar molecules as a quantum simulation platform for the attractive SU(N) FHM.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 pages of supplemental material (with 3 supplemental figures)</p></details> |

| **[Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 Pa...</summary><p>21 Pages, 9 Figures, and 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20254v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which the parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We further develop a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, in which the concrete example for $d=3$ parafermions is studied in detail. We also examine the real parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in superconducting devices. This work extends previous methods for twist defects in superconducting qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Friedel oscillations and chiral superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00273v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 1965 Kohn and Luttinger proposed a genuine electronic mechanism for superconductivity. Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two electrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise to Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among the electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The nature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that superconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for screening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign, a key to the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The momentum-resolved gap equations predict two degenerate solutions at the critical temperature Tc, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing. Their complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry, provides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped chiral phase well below Tc is in excellent agreement with the spectral function extracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Experimental realization of a quantum heat engine based on dissipation-engineered superconducting circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20143v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum heat engines (QHEs) have attracted long-standing scientific interest, especially inspired by considerations of the interplay between heat and work with the quantization of energy levels, quantum superposition, and entanglement. Operating QHEs calls for effective control of the thermal reservoirs and the eigenenergies of the quantum working medium of the engine. Although superconducting circuits enable accurate engineering of controlled quantum systems, beneficial in quantum computing, this framework has not yet been employed to experimentally realize a cyclic QHE. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum heat engine based on superconducting circuits, using a single-junction quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) as a two-way tunable heat reservoir coupled to a flux-tunable transmon qubit acting as the working medium of the engine. We implement a quantum Otto cycle by a tailored drive on the QCR to sequentially induce cooling and heating, interleaved with flux ramps that control the qubit frequency. Utilizing single-shot qubit readout, we monitor the evolution of the qubit state during several cycles of the heat engine and measure positive output powers and efficiencies that agree with our simulations of the quantum evolution. Our results verify theoretical models on the thermodynamics of quantum heat engines and advance the control of dissipation-engineered thermal environments. These proof-of-concept results pave the way for explorations on possible advantages of QHEs with respect to classical heat engines.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Thoughts about boosting superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05828v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a superconductor electrons form pairs despite the Coulomb repulsion as a result of an effective attractive interaction mediated by, for example phonons. In the present paper DeGennes' description of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction is adopted for the effective interaction. This model is generalized by including the elastic response of the charge-compensating background and the BCS gap equation is solved for the resulting effective electron-electron interaction. It is demonstrated that the superconducting critical temperature becomes strongly enhanced when the material is tuned close to a structural instability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Low crosstalk modular flip-chip architecture for coupled superconducting qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19927v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a flip-chip architecture for an array of coupled superconducting qubits, in which circuit components reside inside individual microwave enclosures. In contrast to other flip-chip approaches, the qubit chips in our architecture are electrically floating, which guarantees a simple, fully modular assembly of capacitively coupled circuit components such as qubit, control, and coupling structures, as well as reduced crosstalk between the components. We validate the concept with a chain of three nearest neighbor coupled generalized flux qubits in which the center qubit acts as a frequency-tunable coupler. Using this coupler, we demonstrate a transverse coupling on/off ratio $\approx$ 50, zz-crosstalk $\approx$ 0.7 kHz between resonant qubits and isolation between the qubit enclosures > 60 dB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting intrinsic superconducting properties in intercalated layered superconductors using an extended 2D Tinkham model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19733v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bulk two dimensional (2D) superconductivity has gained considerable attention due to its intricate interplay between symmetry breaking, nontrivial topology, 2D phase fluctuations, and unconventional superconductivity. However, certain intercalated layered superconductors, despite their short c-axis superconducting coherence length, have been misclassified as anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) superconductors. Here, we investigate (Li,Fe)OHFeSe superconductors with varying degrees of interlayer misalignment, revealing sample-dependent superconducting dimensionality while consistently observing Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transitions. To resolve this discrepancy, we develop an extended 2D Tinkham model that quantitatively captures the blurring effects induced by interlayer misalignment. We further demonstrate the validity of this model in both (Li,Fe)OHFeSe and cetyltrimethyl ammonium (CTA+) intercalated (CTA)0.5SnSe2 superconductors, highlighting its broad applicability. This work provides valuable insights into bulk 2D superconductivity and establishes an extended 2D Tinkham model for quantitatively extracting intrinsic superconducting properties in intercalated layered superconductors, particularly those exhibiting significant interlayer misalignments.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19599v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We find that the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic, has a spin-texture with an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy that is revealed in measurements of the in-plane critical field in the superconducting state, as well as from quantum corrections to the magnetoresistance in the normal state. This spin texture is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. Our findings demonstrate that magnetic overlayers provide a unique probe of spin textures and related phenomena in heterostructures.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19501v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We conduct first-principles simulations of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a material in which a recent series of experiments has found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Band Renormalization, Quarter Metals, and Chiral Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Tetralayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19474v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, exotic superconductivity emerging from a spin-and-valley-polarized metallic phase has been observed in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. To explain this finding, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in determining flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree Fock (HF) approximation, and also superconductivity driven by repulsive interactions. Though mean field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Superconductivity arises in the spin-valley polarized phase for a range of electric fields and electron doping. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a $p$-wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal symmetry broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, supplementary material.

| **[Thermal spectrometer for superconducting circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13417v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages and 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Exact quantum critical states with a superconducting quantum processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19185v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can determine rigorously these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, confirming the generalized mechanism. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the current research of finding $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at and above $300$ K is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of other effects and phenomena including phase transitions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Low-overhead Superconducting Non-local Coupler with Exponentially Enhanced Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18902v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction codes with non-local connections such as quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) incur lower overhead and outperform surface codes on large-scale devices. These codes are not applicable on current superconducting devices with nearest-neighbor connections. To rectify the deficiency in connectivity of superconducting circuit system, we experimentally demonstrate a convenient on-chip coupler of centimeters long and propose an extra coupler layer to map the qubit array to a binary-tree connecting graph. This mapping layout reduces the average qubit entangling distance from O(N) to O(logN), demonstrating an exponentially enhanced connectivity with eliminated crosstalk. The entangling gate with the coupler is performed between two fluxonium qubits, reaching a fidelity of 99.37 % while the system static ZZ rate remains as low as 144 Hz without active cancellation or circuit parameter targeting. With the scalable binary tree structure and high-fidelity non-local entanglement, novel quantum algorithms can be implemented on the superconducting qubit system, positioning it as a strong competitor to other physics systems regarding circuit connectivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ab initio modeling of single-photon detection in superconducting nanowires](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13791v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasiparticle and phonon dynamics are central to the operation of many superconducting devices. Using a kinetic equation approach and Density Functional Theory, we model the nonequilibrium quasiparticle and phonon dynamics of a thin superconducting film under optical irradiation ab initio. We extend this model to develop a theory for the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires. In doing so, we create a framework for exploring new superconducting materials for enhanced device performance beyond the state-of-the-art. In contrast to previous models of superconducting devices, our ab initio approach is capable of making predictions of device performance without experimental input and thus can be used to accelerate progress in device development. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with nonequilibrium theory of superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device-level applications. Although we focus in this study on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, these methods are general, and they can be extended to model other superconducting devices, including transition-edge sensors, microwave resonators, and superconducting qubits.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using a Charge-Sensitive Superconducting Coupler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08915v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using a charge-sensitive superconducting coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Revisiting the spin-orbit scattering in small-sized superconducting particles in the magnetic field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17998v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Knight shift of nuclear magnetic resonance is an experimental probe of the paramagnetic spin susceptibility in metals. Information about the electron pairing in superconductors can be extracted from the Knight shift in the small-sized particles. The finite zero-temperature magnitude of paramagnetic susceptibility observed in the superconducting particles has been associated with the spin-orbit scattering of conduction electrons. The conventional treatment has delivered the paramagnetic susceptibility magnitude proportional to the square of the spin-orbit interaction amplitude. Here we examine the coupling between the superconducting current and the spin-orbit scattering of conduction electrons in the small-sized particles. Such interference coupling, absent in the normal state, results in an additional spin polarization of the conduction electrons generating the superconducting current in the magnetic field. This anomalous effect delivers the noticeably larger contribution to the paramagnetic susceptibility. The magnitude of the effect as well as the contribution to the paramagnetic susceptibility prove to be proportional to the amplitude of spin-orbit interaction. The frequency of electron paramagnetic resonance is shifted as well.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Multimode operation of a superconducting nanowire switch in the nanosecond regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17980v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting circuits are promising candidates for future computational architectures, however, practical applications require fast operation. Here, we demonstrate fast, gate-based switching of an Al nanowire-based superconducting switch in time-domain experiments. We apply voltage pulses on the gate while monitoring the microwave transmission of the device. Utilizing the usual leakage-based operation these measurements yield a fast, 1--2~ns switching time to the normal state, possibly limited by the bandwidth of our setup, and a 10--20~ns delay in the normal to superconducting transition. However, having a significant capacitance between the gate and the device allows for a novel operation, where the displacement current, induced by the fast gate pulses, drives the transition. The switching from superconducting to the normal state yields a similar fast timescale, while in the opposite direction the switching is significantly faster (4--6~ns) than the leakage based operation, which may be further improved by better thermal design. The measured short timescales and novel switching operation open the way for future fast and low-power-consumption applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Microwave dynamics of gated Al/InAs superconducting nanowires](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17970v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several experiments have recently reported on gate-tunable superconducting properties in metallic devices, holding promise for the realization of cryogenic switches, tunable resonators, and superconducting logic. In particular, the suppression of the critical current as a function of the gate voltage has been widely investigated. However, time-domain studies are discussed only in a few cases. In this paper, we present a microwave characterization of a gate-controlled Al-capped InAs nanowire embedded in a $\lambda/4$ coplanar waveguide resonator. We observe a shift in the resonator frequency and an increase in its internal losses as a function of the gate voltage, which we relate to a change in the imaginary and real components of the nanowire impedance, respectively. We demonstrate that these changes are described by the Mattis-Bardeen model with an effective temperature. We further study the resonator response to fast gate signals and measure characteristic response times of the order of 40 ns, both in time-domain and parametric modulation experiments. Our study elucidates the impact of the gate on the complex impedance of the nanowire in the superconducting state, as well as its dynamic performance, providing a foundation for the design of gate-controlled superconducting devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Intrinsic Quality Factors Approaching 10 Million in Superconducting Planar Resonators via Spiral Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17901v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the use of spiral geometry in superconducting resonators to achieve high intrinsic quality factors, crucial for applications in quantum computation and quantum sensing. We fabricated Archimedean Spiral Resonators (ASRs) using domain-matched epitaxially grown titanium nitride (TiN) on silicon wafers, achieving intrinsic quality factors of $Q_\mathrm{i} = (9.6 \pm 1.5) \times 10^6$ at the single-photon level and $Q_\mathrm{i} = (9.91 \pm 0.39) \times 10^7$ at high power, significantly outperforming traditional coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators. We conducted a comprehensive numerical analysis using COMSOL to calculate surface participation ratios (PRs) at critical interfaces: metal-air, metal-substrate, and substrate-air. Our findings reveal that ASRs have lower PRs than CPWs, explaining their superior quality factors and reduced coupling to two-level systems (TLSs).</p></details> |  |

| **[Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19584v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</p></details> | 24 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19483v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Remote Stimulation of QED Scenarios in the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19094v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The article addresses the important and relevant task of remote induction of quantum dynamic scenarios. This involves transferring such scenarios from donor atoms to a target atom. This induction is based on the enhancement of quantum transitions in the presence of multiple photons of the same transition. We use the quantum master equation for the Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard (TCH) model with multiple cavities connected to the target cavity via waveguides. The dependence of the efficiency and transfer of the scenario on the number of donor cavities, the number of atoms in them, and the bandwidth of the waveguides is investigated.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Effects of the Hubbard interaction on the quantum metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02753v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum geometry provides important information about the structure and topology of quantum states in various forms of quantum matter. The information contained therein has profound effects on observable quantities such as superconducting weight, Drude weight, and optical responses. Motivated by the recent advances in flat-band interacting systems, we investigate the role of interaction effects on the quantum metric. By using the fermionic Creutz ladder as a representative system, we show that the repulsive Hubbard interaction monotonically suppresses the quantum metric. While the eigenstates and their overlap quantifying the quantum metric can be obtained exactly in the presence of interactions through exact diagonalization, this method is limited to small system sizes. Alternatively, two theoretical proposals, the generalized quantum metric and the dressed quantum metric, suggest using renormalized Green's functions to define the interacting quantum metric. By comparing these analytical approaches with results from exact diagonalization, we show that the dressed quantum metric provides a better fit to the exact diagonalization results. Our conclusion holds for both flat-band and dispersive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures; close to the published version</p></details> |
| **[Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices: Metal-insulator transitions, global antiferromagnetism, and enhanced boundary fluctuations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03416v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schl\"afli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.</p></details> | 21 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Universal charge and spin Drude weights in one-dimensional Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17171v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drude weight (DW) is one of the most important quantities characterizing the quantum transport properties of many-body systems. Despite of intense studies of many decades, there still lacks rigorous understanding of transport behavior for various quantum phases at low temperatures. Here we report on universal properties of DWs in one-dimensional repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model with arbitrary magnetic fields. In addition to the usual charge and spin DWs, we also construct the cross DW that captures the cross influences between the two degrees of freedom in the transport dynamics, showing a subtle spin and charge coupling effect. Our analytical expressions of the DWs at different Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phases essentially establish general relations between the Luttinger parameters and the DWs. We further obtain explicit universal critical scaling laws for DWs across various phase boundaries and propose an experimental protocol to measure the DWs.We find that the DWs obtained from the direct numerical simulation of this protocol show qualitatively good agreement with the Bethe ansatz results.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+21 ...</summary><p>6+21 pages, 4+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Relaxation to persistent currents in a Hubbard trimer coupled to fermionic baths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06331v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a ring of fermionic quantum sites, modeled by the Fermi--Hubbard Hamiltonian, in which electrons can move and interact strongly via the Coulomb repulsion. The system is coupled to fermionic cold baths which by the exchange of particles and energy induce relaxation in the system. We eliminate the environment and describe the system effectively by Lindblad master equations in various versions valid for different coupling parameter regimes. The early relaxation phase proceeds in a universal way, irrespective of the relative couplings and approximations. The system settles down to its low--energy sector and is consecutively well approximated by the Heisenberg model. We compare different Lindblad approaches which, in the late relaxation, push the system towards different final states with opposite, extreme spin orders, from ferromagenetic to antiferromagnetic. Due to spin frustration in the trimer (a three site ring), degenerate ground states are formed by spin waves (magnons). The system described by the global coherent version of the Lindblad operators relaxes towards the final states carrying directed persistent spin currents. We numerically confirm these predictions.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

Nevertheless, relatively few non-perturbative studies of correlated SSH models have been conducted in dimensions greater than one, and those that have been done have primarily focused on bond models, where generalized displacements independently modulate each hopping integral. We conducted a sign-problem free determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of the optical SSH-Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice, where site-centered phonon modes simultaneously modulate pairs of nearest-neighbor hopping integrals. We report the model's low-temperature phase diagram in the challenging adiabatic regime ($\Omega/E_\mathrm{F} \sim 1/8$). It exhibits insulating antiferromagnetic Mott and bond-order-wave (BOW) phases with a narrow region of coexistence between them. We also find that a critical $e$-ph coupling is required to stabilize the BOW phase in the small $U$ limit. Lastly, in stark contrast to recent findings for the model's bond variant, we find no evidence for a long-range antiferromagnetism in the pure $(U/t=0)$ optical SSH model.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 pages of supplemental materials</p></details> |

While submatrix updates were originally developed for Hirsch-Fye QMC with onsite interactions at finite temperatures [Phys. Rev. B 80, 195111 (2009)], their comprehensive application in DQMC has remained unexplored despite noted algorithmic similarities. We present the first comprehensive application of submatrix updates in DQMC, significantly extending beyond the original scope by enabling simulations with extended interactions and at zero temperature. Building upon conventional fast updates and delay updates, our generalized implementation achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, enabling simulations of the half-filled Hubbard model on lattices up to 8,000 sites - a scale previously challenging with standard DQMC implementations. This enhanced computational capability allows us to accurately determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

At $\nu=1/2$ and small $U$, they observe an enhanced compressibility on the $p_{x,y}$ sites, pointing to a flat band near the Fermi energy. At $\nu=1/2$ and large $U$ they observe an insulating ferrimagnet. Both small and large $U$ observations at $\nu=1/2$ are consistent with theoretical expectations. Surprisingly, near $\nu=1/4$ and large $U$, they again observe a large $p_{x,y}$ compressibility, pointing to a flat $p_{x,y}$ band of fermions across the Fermi energy. Our Hartree-Fock computations near $\nu=1/4$ find states with canted magnetism (and related spiral states) at large $U$, which possess nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ bands near the Fermi level. We employ parton theories to describe quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order found in Hartree-Fock. We find a metallic state with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization possessing gapless, fermionic, spinless `chargons' carrying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges which have a nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ band near their Fermi level: this fractionalized metal is also consistent with observations. Our DMRG study does not indicate the presence of magnetic order, and so supports a fractionalized ground state. Given the conventional ferrimagnetic insulator at $\nu=1/2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalized metal at $\nu=1/4$ represents a remarkable realization of doping-induced fractionalization.</p></details> |  |

Oxygen vacancies, particularly in positively charged states, are suggested to profoundly impact the polymorphism kinetics and phase stability of hafnia, thereby affecting its ferroelectric behavior. The electronic structures of pristine and oxygen-deficient hafnia polymorph have been extensively studied using density functional theory, primarily employing (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals. However, these methods often underestimate band gaps and may not accurately capture the localized nature of $d$-electrons. In this work, we investigate hafnia in various phases using DFT + $U$ + $V$, with onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently via the pseudohybrid Hubbard density functional, ACBN0, and its extended version eACBN0. We find that the self-consistent DFT + $U$ method provides comparable accuracy to the computationally more expensive Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional in predicting relative thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and density of states. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective approach for estimating the formation energies of oxygen vacancies. Additionally, we demonstrate that environmentally dependent Hubbard parameters serve as useful indicators for analyzing bond strengths and electronic structures in real space.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we apply several many-body theories in the three-dimensional attractive Hubbard model. Specifically, we compare the results of various GW methods with DQMC simulations and observe that they provide reliable results in the weak to intermediate coupling regime. The critical exponents also agree well with the accurate results obtained from the 3D XY model. In the superconducting phase, the post-GW method significantly improves the description of Green's functions and density of states.

Here, the fermionic part is constructed by a pair-product state, which explicitly depends on the phonon configuration, thus including the electron-phonon coupling in a backflow-inspired way. We report the results for the Hubbard model in presence of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger coupling to optical phonons, both at half-filling and upon hole doping. At half-filling, the ground state is either a translationally invariant Mott insulator, with gapless spin excitations, or a Peierls insulator, which breaks translations and has fully gapped excitations. Away from half-filling, the charge gap closes in both Mott and Peierls insulators, turning the former into a conventional Luttinger liquid (gapless in all excitation channels). The latter, instead, retains a finite spin gap that closes only above a threshold value of the doping. Even though consistent with the general theory of interacting electrons in one dimension, the existence of such a phase (with gapless charge but gapped spin excitations) has never been demonstrated in a model with repulsive interaction and with only two Fermi points. Since the spin-gapped metal represents the one-dimensional counterpart of a superconductor, our results furnish evidence that a true off-diagonal long-range order may exist in the two-dimensional case.</p></details> |  |

At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 4, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from self-consistent mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid (or stripe) states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U. We study the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid. The critical behavior serves as strong signatures of the critical theory and consequently of the existence of chiral spin liquid as the proximate phase.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses. We finally investigate the dissipative quench dynamics starting from a strongly-correlated superfluid state or from a Mott-insulating state; for the Bose-Hubbard chain initially confined in the superfluid-correlated regime, an unexpected strong decay of the density appearing at short times is revealed.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |

Here, by developing a hybrid potential that integrates a flat-top optical lattice with an optical box trap, we successfully realize the creation of three-dimensional, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases across approximately $8\times10^5$ lattice sites. This homogeneous system enables us to capture a well-defined energy band occupation that aligns perfectly with the theoretical calculations for a zero-temperature, ideal fermionic Hubbard model. Furthermore, by employing novel radio-frequency spectroscopy, we precisely measure the doublon fraction $D$ as a function of interaction strength $U$ and temperature $T$, respectively. The crossover from metal to Mott insulator is detected, where $D$ smoothly decreases with increasing $U$. More importantly, we observe a non-monotonic temperature dependence in $D$, revealing the Pomeranchuk effect and the development of extended antiferromagnetic correlations.</p></details> |  |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |
| **[Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Quantum-interference-induced pairing in antiferromagnetic bosonic $t$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15424v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pairing mechanism in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t$-$J$ model is investigated via large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations. In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

| **[Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

The VMC results are in good agreement with the exact diagonalization (ED) calculation. For the single-hole case, the degenerate ground states are characterized by quantum numbers of a spin-1/2 and an orbital angular momentum $L_z=\pm 2$. The latter is associated with the emergent chiral spin/hole currents mutually surrounding the hole/spin-1/2 as a composite object or ``twisted hole''. A vanishing quasiparticle spectral weight is shown in the large-sample limit. In the two-hole ground state, the holes form a spin-singlet pairing with $d$+$id$ symmetry in the Cooper channel, but are of $s$-wave symmetry as a tightly bound pair of the ``twisted holes''. Such a pairing mechanism of dichotomy can be attributed to eliminating the local spin currents which has nothing to do with the long-range antiferromagnetic correlation. Superconducting ground state at finite doping is briefly discussed in terms of the tightly bound hole pairs as the building blocks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

The superconducting pairing symmetry is $s_\pm$-wave and is robust against the variation of the interaction strength. In this model, although the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are away from the Fermi level, the superconducting pairing function on them is not tiny. Instead, since the top of the $\gamma$ band and bottom of the $\delta$ band are both located at $\sim$500 meV away from the Fermi level, and they are almost nested by the peak structure in the spin fluctuation, thus by forming an anti-phase pairing function on them, these two bands act constructively to superconductivity. Finally with detailed derivation and numerical calculation, we demonstrate that the Fermi surface approximated Eliashberg equation may lead to deviation of the pairing symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.11429</p></details> |

However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.</p></details> |  |

In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we propose that superconductivity in this compound is primarily driven by interlayer pairing mechanisms. This interlayer pairing results in an effective $s_\pm$ pairing gap, with the sign of the pairing gap varying across different Fermi pockets. In the superconducting state, our analysis reveals a striking absence of a spin resonance mode. Moreover, we reveal a spectrum of energy-dependent incommensurate spin excitations. The observed incommensurate structures are elegantly explained by the nesting effect of energy contours, providing a coherent and comprehensive account of experimental observations. The implications of these spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are profound, offering critical insights into the superconducting mechanism at play. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of this novel superconductor but also pave the way for further research into the interplay between spin dynamics and unconventional superconductivity in layered materials.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

For La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/LaAlO$_3$(001), we find that compressive strain and electron doping across the interface result in the unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states. In sharp contrast, no charge transfer is observed for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/SrTiO$_3$(001). Surprisingly, tensile strain drives a metallization of the bonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, rendering a Fermi surface topology akin to superconducting bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under high pressure, yet with spin fluctuations enhanced considerably beyond pressure effects. Concomitantly, significant octahedral rotations are retained. We discuss the fundamental differences between hydrostatic pressure versus epitaxial strain and establish that strain provides a much stronger control over the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization. The results suggest epitaxial La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, particularly under tensile strain, as interesting system to provide novel insights into the physics of bilayer nickelates and possibly induce superconductivity without external pressure.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we report the superconductor-insulator transition in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ interfaces, with corresponding electronic structures revealed using synchrotron low-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray linear dichroism (XLD). In addition to the valence states of each element within the films determined by XAS, XLD at the O K edge pre-peak reveals hybridizations involving both 2p$_{z}$ and 2p$_{x}$/2p$_{y}$ orbitals, which are concomitantly suppressed upon oxygen loss. Intriguingly, such oxygen loss that eliminates superconductivity, induces a qualitative XLD change at the Ni L$_{2}$ edge, implying significant transformations among 3d$_{x^{2}}$ $_{-y^{2}}$ and 3d$_{z^{2}}$ energy bands near the Fermi level.

Here, we successfully probe the energy gap and dispersion renormalization in one unit-cell La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates, by developing an ultra-high vacuum quenching technique for in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. The energy gap is observed on the underlying Fermi surface without showing a node along the Brillouin zone diagonal. This gap exhibits particle-hole symmetric behavior and persists to a temperature higher than the superconducting transition temperature, indicating the existence of a pseudogap. An abrupt band renormalization is observed with a dispersion anomaly at ~70 meV below Fermi level, pointing to another energy scale besides the energy gap. These observations provide initial information on fundamental properties of the superconducting state in bilayer nickelates under ambient pressure.</p></details> |  |

However, while zero resistance state has been observed, experimental characterization of the superconducting properties of pressurized nickelates is still limited and experimentally challenging. Here, we present the first full temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 measurement in La4Ni3O10 single crystal, achieved by combining high magnetic field and high-pressure techniques. Remarkably, the Hc2 of La4Ni3O10 is nearly isotropic, with the anisotropic parameter monotonically increasing from 1.4 near Tc to 1 at lower temperatures. By analyzing the Hc2 using the two-band model, we uncover that the anisotropic diffusivity of the bands, primarily originating from d(z2 ) and d(x2-y2 ) orbitals, is well compensated, resulting in an unusually isotropic superconducting state. These findings provide critical experimental evidence that underscores the significant role of the d(z2 ) orbital in enabling superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we investigate the fate of the SC properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the SC pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Previous experimental works have confirmed the existence of a tiny energy gap formed with Ni 3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Here we investigate the physical origin of this gap by analyzing symmetry properties of energy bands based on the group theory. The tiny gap comes from energy bands with opposite parity at the Brillouin zone center. In addition, we also find previously unknown Dirac points in some momentum directions around the Fermi level. An effective Hamiltonian is constructed to describe low energy physics of the tiny energy gap and Dirac points. Due to the low crystal symmetry of monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, its energy bands display strong anisotropic properties.</p></details> | 14 pages 5 figures |

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we utilized temperature-dependent in-situ Ni K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to probe the Ni-3d/4p electronic states of La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta samples down to 4.8 K, enabling us to witness the evolution of both in-plane d_(x^2-y^2)/p_x (p_y) and out-of-plane d_(3z^2-r^2)/p_z orbitals of NiO6 octahedron across the DW transition. Main edge energy associated with Ni 4p orbital shows an anomalous decline near DW transition, signifying the occurrence of lattice distortions as a hallmark of charge density wave. Below DW transition, the enlarged crystal field splitting (CFS) indicates an enhanced NiO6 octahedral distortion. Intriguingly, magnetic Pr substituents could activate the mutual interplay of d_(x^2-y^2) and d_(3z^2-r^2) orbitals. We discussed its relevance to the favored bulk SC in the pressurized polycrystalline La2PrNi2O7-delta than pristine.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Possible Fano effect and suppression of Andreev reflection in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14294v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently-discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive debates. Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and other multilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

We find significant hardening of optical Ni-O bond-stretching phonons when going from non-magnetic to paramagnetic state, and increasing Coulomb interaction will make them even harder. The electron correlation is found to be sensitive to the Ni-O bond-stretching distortions, indicating strong interplay between electron correlation and lattice. We find that the strong local electron correlation will not favor charge orders that couple to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons, in support of the recent experiment that a $3a_0$ charge order is absent in the infinite-layer nickelates. Our results emphasize that the effects of local magnetic fluctuations should be fully taken into account when describing the lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelates without long-range magnetic orders, and also provide evidence to ascribe the kink observed in the recent angle-resolved photoemission experiment to possible strong electron coupling to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Has b...</summary><p>Has been accepted for a publication in PRB</p></details> |

Here, we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistance, and Meissner effect in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with hydrostatic pressures up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase above 40 GPa. Zero resistance of the superconductivity was achieved with a maximum onset $T_c^{onset}$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed until it disappears above 80 GPa, resulting in a right-triangle-like superconducting region. The direct-current magnetic susceptibility technique successfully detected the Meissner effect in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure; the maximum superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be 62.7% at 22.0 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals under high pressure. The results reveal intimate connections among the superconductivity, oxygen content, and structure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a renewed version with Meissner effect measurements</p></details> |

To gain deeper insights into the distinct superconducting states, it is essential to unravel the nature of the density-wave states at ambient pressure, a topic that remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the direct visualization of an incommensurate unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in real space. The density of states (DOS) is strongly depleted near $E_F$, indicating the opening of a CDW gap of $2{\Delta} \approx 71$ meV, which is unfavorable for the formation of superconductivity at ambient pressure. We propose that the CDW arises from Fermi surface nesting, and is likely a subsidiary phase of a spin density wave. Compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the weaker electronic correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is likely one reason for the lower $T_c$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Band Structure and Pairing Nature of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film at Ambient Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10409v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, evidences of superconductivity (SC) with onset $T_c$ above the McMillan limit have been detected in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the LaSrAlO$_4$ substrate at ambient pressure. This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved-photo-emission-spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants and is insensitive to the c-axis one. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.1 p...</summary><p>4.1 pages, 5 figures with Appendix</p></details> |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe and WSe$_2$ nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to $2.2\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for SnSe$_2$ and up to $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for WSe$_2$.</p></details> |  |

The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04131v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrupolar Excitons in MoSe$_2$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18040v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for platforms to generate and control exotic excitonic states has greatly benefited from the advent of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their heterostructures. Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript just accepted in Nature Communications.

| **[Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03361v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-valley polarization control in WSe$_2$ monolayers using photochemical doping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03049v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</p></details> |  |
| **[Valley-mediated singlet- and triplet-polaron interactions and quantum dynamics in a doped WSe$_2$ monolayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02372v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In doped transition metal dichalcogenides, optically created excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) can strongly interact with a Fermi sea of electrons to form Fermi polaron quasiparticles. When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures (Published version)</p></details> |

In this work, we exploit the intense excitonic PL of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer combined with the high refractive index of bulk WS$_2$ to fabricate microdisk cavities with tunable light emission characteristics. These microdisks are created from a 50-nm-thick WS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure using frictional mechanical scanning probe lithography. The resulting cavities achieve a 4-10-fold enhancement in excitonic PL from the MoSe$_2$ monolayer at wavelengths near 800 nm. The excitonic PL peak is modulated by sharp spectral features, which correspond to whispering gallery modes (WGMs) supported by the cavity. A microdisk with a diameter of 2.35 $\mu$m demonstrates WGMs with a quality factor of up to 700, significantly surpassing theoretical predictions and suggesting strong potential for lasing applications. The spectral positions of the WGMs can be finely tuned by adjusting the microdisk's diameter and thickness, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. This approach offers a novel route for developing ultra-compact, all-TMDC double heterostructure light sources with record-small size.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures allow for tuning their electronic properties beyond their monolayer counterparts. We start by determining their electronic structure using density functional theory. We obtain the type-II band alignment and close in energy conduction band minima (valleys) at the $K$ and $Q$ points in the Brillouin zone. The valence band maxima, also energetically close, are located at the $K$ and $\Gamma$ points. By analyzing the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions, we describe the layer, spin, and orbital contributions. Next, we construct an \textit{ab initio}-based tight-binding model, which helps us to better understand the complexity of the interlayer interactions. We determine the effect of a vertical electric field, showing that vertical gating enables control of valleys extrema and their occupancy. Finally, we employ the tight-binding model to investigate laterally gated quantum dots and analyze the influence of a perpendicular electric field on their energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate that tuning the electric field enables control over the valley character of the quantum dot states, selectively localizing them in either the $K$ or $Q$ valleys, as evidenced by their characteristic degeneracies and wavefunctions.</p></details> |  |

In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporate the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir\'{e} unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferromagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Moreover, the hybridization of states from different layers and different valleys is allowed near the Fermi level. Those aspects are in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-gap superconductivity in a Janus MoSeLi monolayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08119v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) lithium-decorated materials have emerged as a significant area of study since the prediction of superconductivity in lithium-decorated graphene at temperatures around 8.1 K, with experimental evidence observed at Tc = 5.9 K. Following earlier studies, this paper focuses on the hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer as a promising candidate for Li-decorated 2D materials. Our research reveals that lithium substitution on a selenium layer of MoSe2 can produce a hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer, which exhibits metallic behavior with potential phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.5 K. Additionally, by solving the anisotropic gap equations derived from Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we found that the Janus MoSeLi monolayer exhibits two-gap superconductivity. This finding underscores the potential of hexagonal Janus MoSeLi as a significant Li-decorated 2D material for exploring two-dimensional superconductivity and sets the stage for further investigations into new families of Janus transition-metal chalcogenides.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir\'e patterns of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H-stacking at a twist angle of 3.89$^{\circ}$ without spin-orbit coupling effect. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15$^{\circ}$. Multiple ultra-flat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7$^{\circ}$. The spin-orbit coupling leads to a giant spin splitting comparable to that observed in the untwisted system (about 0.45 eV) and is nearly independent of twisting and stacking. As a result, the K-valley flat band remains the valence band maximum with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Band unfolding reveals that the ultra-flat bands formed by the $\Gamma$ and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The $\Gamma$-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by structural reconstruction. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13$^{\circ}$) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</p></details> |  |

So far, it is assumed that the atomic reconstruction appearing in some of the heterostructures gives rise to a dominating localization of the exciton states. We demonstrate that excitonic states in reconstructed MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures can extend well beyond the moir\'e periodicity of the investigated heterostructures. The results are based on real-space calculations yielding a lateral potential map for interlayer excitons within the strain-relaxed heterostructures and corresponding real-space excitonic wavefunctions. We combine the theoretical results with cryogenic photoluminescence experiments, which support the computed level structure and relaxation characteristics of the interlayer excitons.</p></details> |  |

Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Typos...</summary><p>Typos corrected; Refs added</p></details> |

However, graphene's inertness inhibits the adsorption of closed films, thus favoring island growth, whose inhomogeneity might be reflected in the induced properties. In order to study the homogeneity of the doping profile induced by an inhomogeneous coverage and the spin orbit coupling (SOC) induced in graphene, we deposited Pb(111) islands with an average coverage of up to 30 ML on monolayer graphene (MLG) on SiC(0001) at room temperature (RT). We investigated the transport properties and the structure using magnetotransport, and scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron deflection, respectively. The Pb(111) islands act as donors, increasing the electron concentration of graphene by about $5\times10^{11}\;\text{ML}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}$. The doping was found to be homogeneous, in stark contrast to our previous results for Bi islands on MLG. Upon percolation of the Pb layer at around 5 ML, hole transport through the Pb islands has to be taken into account in order to describe the transport data. The Pb(111) islands do not induce any Rashba SOC, contrary to theoretical predictions for an interface between Pb(111) and graphene. Moreover, they seem to screen the defects in the graphene, resulting in a reduction of the intervalley scattering rate up to 5 ML.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This work presents a comprehensive theoretical characterization of pristine and porous 12-AGNRs based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. DFT calculations reveal substantial electronic modifications, including band gap widening and the emergence of localized states. Analyzed within the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) framework, optical properties highlight strong excitonic effects and significant absorption shifts. Thermal transport simulations indicate a pronounced reduction in conductivity due to enhanced phonon scattering at nanopores. At the same time, MD-based mechanical analysis shows decreased stiffness and strength while maintaining structural integrity. Despite these modifications, porous 12-AGNRs remain mechanically and thermally stable. These findings establish porosity engineering as a powerful strategy for tailoring graphene nanoribbons' functional properties, reinforcing their potential for nanoelectronic, optoelectronic, and thermal management applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03139v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength squeezing, and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable polaritonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hysteretic responses of nanomechanical resonators based on crumpled few-layer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19783v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating two-dimensional materials occasionally results in crumpled membranes. Their complicated morphologies feature an abundance of folds, creases and wrinkles that make each crumpled membrane unique. Here, we prepare four nanomechanical resonators based on crumpled membranes of few-layer graphene and measure their static response and the spectrum of their dynamic response. We tune both responses with a dc voltage applied between the membrane and an underlying gate electrode. Surprisingly, we find that all four resonators exhibit hysteretic responses as the gate voltage is increased and then decreased. Concomitant discontinuities in the static response and in the vibrational resonant frequencies indicate a sudden change in the shape and in the tensile strain of the membranes. We also find that the hystereses can be removed and regular responses can be restored by annealing the resonators. We hypothesize that the hysteretic nature of the responses may originate from an interplay between the rugged morphology of the membranes and adsorbates trapped within the confine of the folds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The following article has been submitted to Applied Physics Letters</p></details> |

Recent studies have demonstrated that Pt atoms can intercalate at the heterointerface between SiC(0001) and the C-rich $(6\sqrt{3}\times6\sqrt{3})$R30{\deg} reconstructed surface (hereafter referred as the buffer layer). However, key aspects such as intercalated phase structure and intercalation mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we investigate changes in morphology, chemistry, and electronic structure for both buffer layer and monolayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) following Pt deposition and annealing cycles, which eventually led to Pt intercalation at temperatures above 500{\deg}C. Atomic-resolution imaging of the buffer layer reveals a single intercalated Pt layer that removes the periodic corrugation of the buffer layer, arising from partial bonding of C-atoms with Si-atoms of the substrate. In monolayer graphene, the Pt-intercalated regions exhibit a two-level structure: the first level corresponds to a Pt layer intercalated below the buffer layer, while the second level contains a second Pt layer, giving rise to a $(12\times12)$ superstructure relative to graphene. Upon intercalation, Pt atoms appear as silicides, indicating a reaction with Si atoms from the substrate. Additionally, charge neutral $\pi$-bands corresponding to quasi-free-standing monolayer and bilayer graphene emerge. Analysis of multiple samples, coupled with a temperature-dependent study of the intercalation rate, demonstrates the pivotal role of buffer layer regions in facilitating the Pt intercalation in monolayer graphene. These findings provide valuable insight into Pt intercalation, advancing the potential for applications.</p></details> |  |

To explain this finding, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in determining flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree Fock (HF) approximation, and also superconductivity driven by repulsive interactions. Though mean field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Superconductivity arises in the spin-valley polarized phase for a range of electric fields and electron doping. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a $p$-wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal symmetry broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, supplementary material.

In this paper, we obtain higher-order corrections to the Bistritzer-MacDonald model via a systematic multiple-scales expansion. We prove that the solution of the resulting higher-order PDE model accurately approximates the corresponding tight-binding wave function under a natural choice of parameters and given initial conditions that are spectrally localized to the monolayer Dirac points. Numerical simulations of tight-binding and continuum dynamics demonstrate the validity of the higher-order continuum model. Symmetries of the higher-order models are also discussed. This work extends the analysis from \cite{watson2023bistritzer}, which rigorously established the validity of the (first-order) BM model.</p></details> |  |

We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Their simplest property stems from their resonant response: they behave as filters, responding only to driving signals whose frequency range is contained within that of the mechanical response. While the response is routinely probed with a single tone drive, a multifrequency drive offers the possibility of inducing richer vibrational dynamics. In this case, all the frequency components of the drive are simultaneously transduced into vibrations with different amplitudes and phases that superimpose and interfere. Here, we employ a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator as a filter for broadband, digitally modulated video signals. We transduce the modulated drive into modulated vibrations, which we demodulate into a nanomechanical video. Our work reveals distinctive features in vibrations driven by a coherent, multifrequency drive unseen in vibrations actuated by single tone drives or by a force noise.</p></details> |  |

This fractality enables a reliable calculation of low-energy band counts, which are crucial for understanding both single-particle and correlation effects. Using an effective Hamiltonian that includes in- and out-of-plane lattice relaxation, we analyze SMS in hBN-encapsulated single and bilayer graphene.

In these materials, the exchange couplings between magnetic atoms are predominantly governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an unusual prolonged decay of r to the power of minus n, where r is the M-M separation distance, and n is between 0.5 and 2. In this paper, we explore the effects of induced strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers through ab-initio density functional theory. We employ a specific method to apply strain by positioning atoms from one layer within the equilibrium structure of another layer, thereby inducing strain in the form of either tension or compression. The induced strain results in an approximate plus/minus 0.4% variation in the unit-cell area of the MN4-G lattice. Our findings reveal that while the exchange coupling mechanism remains unaffected, the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling are significantly influenced by the induced strain. Notably, the CoN4-G layer exhibits a remarkable increase in the strength and oscillation amplitude of the RKKY coupling, along with a reduced decay rate. Additionally, the electronic and magnetic properties of the CuN4-G layers remain unchanged under induced strain.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Their large frequency tunability and their pronounced nonlinearities enable an efficient modulation of their resonant frequency. Here, we present measurements of the response of a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator driven by a large parametric pump at frequency $2\omega$ and a weak external drive at $\omega$, where $\omega$ is set near the mechanical resonant frequency $\omega_0$. The pump actuates the resonator beyond the threshold for large-amplitude parametric oscillations, while the drive breaks the symmetry of the parametric phase states. By increasing and decreasing a gate voltage to detune $\omega_0$ in the presence of the pump and the drive, we observe a double hysteresis in the response. The double hysteresis reveals the existence of two possible large-amplitude vibrational states whose phase difference is nearly $\pi$ radians. We deterministically prepare the resonator in either one of these states by cycling the gate voltage. We measure the stationary occupation probabilities of the two states in the presence of a white Gaussian force noise, and find that they strongly depend on the amplitude and on the phase of the external drive. Parametric oscillations with broken phase symmetry hold promise as units of binary information. Their phase states can be mapped to biased bi-modal degrees of freedom, such as Ising spins in an external magnetic field. Our work invites future studies on coupled graphene parametric resonators whose phase states may be mapped to a system of Ising spins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Twist-tuned quantum criticality in moiré bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16042v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that moir\'e bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal and U(1) valley symmetries. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal ground state. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory applied to a realistic model of twisted bilayer graphene, based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian augmented by screened Coulomb interactions, we find that the twist-tuned quantum phase transition is continuous. We argue that the quantum critical behavior belongs to the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY universality class, and we characterize it through an effective field theory analysis. Our theoretical predictions can be directly tested using current experimental setups incorporating the recently developed quantum twisting microscope.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+2 p...</summary><p>7+2 pages, 4+2 figures; v2: internal screening effects incorporated</p></details> |

A notable example is the formation of Wigner crystals driven by strong electron-electron interactions. When these electronic crystals emerge in a parent band carrying a large Berry curvature, they can exhibit topologically nontrivial properties as anomalous Hall crystals, spontaneously breaking both continuous translational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report the experimental observation of tunable anomalous Hall crystals in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene moir\'e superlattices. At filling factors near one electron per moir\'e unit cell (v=1), we identify a series of incommensurate Chern insulators with a Chern number of C=1. Furthermore, we observe spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking spanning the entire filling range from v=1 to v=2, manifesting as anomalous Hall effects with pronounced magnetic hysteresis. Notably, anomalous Hall crystals with a high Chern number C=3 are observed over generic fillings ranging from v=1.5 to v=2. These anomalous Hall crystals are incommensurate with the moir\'e superlattice and exhibit dispersive fan diagrams consistent with the Streda formula, with their positions continuously tunable through displacement fields. Remarkably, these partially filled Chern insulators display Chern numbers distinct from their parent bands. Our findings demonstrate the rich variety of electronic crystalline states in rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattices, offering valuable insights into the strongly correlated topological phases.</p></details> | 4 figures |

The successful implementation of these emerging epitaxial techniques crucially hinges on creating a robust uniform 2D material surface at the wafer-scale and with atomically precise uniformity. The conventional method for fabricating graphene on a SiC wafer is through high-temperature graphitization, which produces epitaxial graphene on the surface of the SiC wafer. However, the extremely high temperature needed for silicon sublimation (> 1500 C) causes step-bunching of the SiC surface in addition to the growth of uneven graphene at the edges of the step, leading to multilayer graphene stripes and unfavorable surface morphology for epitaxial growth. Here, we fully develop a graphitization technique that allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at ultra-low temperatures (growth time of less than 1 min and growth temperature of less than 500 C) at wafer-scale by metal-assisted graphitization. We found annealing conditions that enable SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation, which produces single-crystalline graphene while maintaining atomically smooth surface morphology. The thickness of the graphene layer can be precisely controlled by varying the metal thickness or annealing temperature. We successfully produce freestanding single-crystalline ultra-wide bandgap (AlN, GaN) films on graphene/SiC via the 2D material-based layer transfer technique. Our results show that low-temperature graphene synthesis via MAG represents a promising route for the commercialization of the 2D-based epitaxy technique, enabling the production of large-scale ultra-wide bandgap free-standing crystalline membranes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Transport in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured by Scanning Probe Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17783v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report combined scanning probe microscopy and transport measurements to investigate the local electronic transport properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that the quantum transport properties in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied by an atomic force microscope (AFM) conducting tip. Scanning gate microscopy measurements show a distinct p-type response, where the AFM tip locally gates the rGO, thereby modulating the transport current. Additional scanning impedance microscopy measurements indicate shifts in the Fermi energy under different gating conditions, highlighting the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on the transport characteristics of rGO. We demonstrate that the interplay between the tip-induced Fermi level shifts and defect-mediated scattering processes plays a key role in determining the observed transport behavior. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of scattering mechanisms, particularly resonant scattering caused by impurities or structural defects, in determining low-dimensional transport behavior in rGO. Notably, rGO exhibits resonant scattering effects akin to those seen in one-dimensional systems like carbon nanotubes, despite its two-dimensional structure. These insights advance our current understanding of charge transport in rGO, and have important implications for its use in nanoscale electronics, flexible sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Rev. Res. 2, 023172 (2020)]. In this framework, the Mott gap emerges as a band gap controlled by a hybridization order parameter $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical and ancilla bands. In TBG, the ancilla formalism allows us to calculate the upper and lower Hubbard bands directly in momentum space, both at and away from the magic angle. Projected to the active bands, we reveal a topological obstruction for $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ around the $\Gamma$ point, leading to a topological Mott semi-metal at $\nu=0$. At fillings $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we obtain symmetric correlated insulators at large $U$, and also transitions to semi-metals at smaller $U$ or larger bandwidth. The new formalism also enables us to study the most intriguing density range, $\nu=-2-x$: we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Our theory works above the ordering temperature of a potential symmetry-breaking order. Alternatively, the symmetric pseudogap metal can survive to the zero-temperature limit when there is a sizable anti-Hund's coupling $J_A$. In our theory, the small Fermi surface of the pseudogap metal is primarily formed by ancilla fermions, which we interpret as composite polarons-consisting of a spin moment on an AA site bound to a hole in the nearest neighbor AA site. Within the active band subspace, the composite polaron at $\mathbf k=0$ is orthogonal to the single-particle state due to their differing angular momenta, and thus has vanishing spectral weight. We suggest that superconductivity emerges from the Cooper pairing of these composite fermions instead of single electrons.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential and large filling factor regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages main text, 15 pages Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

The generation of odd harmonics in the reflected and transmitted spectra is obtained. The coefficient of transformation of the first harmonic into the third harmonic at a frequency of 10 Hz is of the order of 10-3. We use perturbative theory based on the quantum Wallace strong coupling model with field amplitude expansion and integration over the entire Brillouin zone (BZ), solving the kinetic Boltzmann equation with a collision integral in the Bhatnagar-Gross-Crook (BGK) form. The electromagnetic field is considered classically, while its vector potential changes the quasi-pulse in the dispersion equation.</p></details> |  |

Quantum Red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses handling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are the building blocks of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a variational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a ubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor network methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum correlations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of particles.

In this work, we review recent approaches based on finding better contraction strategies for the full spatio-temporal tensor networks that encode the path integral of the dynamics, as well as the conceptual integration of influence functionals, process tensors, and transfer matrices within the tensor network formalism. We discuss recent algorithmic developments, highlight the complexity of influence functionals in various dynamical regimes and present consistent results of different communities, showing how ergodic dynamics render these functionals exponentially difficult to compress. Finally, we provide an outlook on strategies to encode complementary influence functional overlaps, paving the way for accurate descriptions of open and closed quantum systems with tensor networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

The tensor network constructed is one dimension higher than the lattice of the physical system, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes in 3D space. The network directly generalizes the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the order parameter of in the spin sector from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, and the correlation in the color sector.</p></details> |  |

The approach involves downfolding the full Hilbert space into a low-energy subspace that captures the most significant electron correlations, leading to an effective Hubbard model. This generalized model is then solved using tensor network methods. Our work focuses on one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional materials, for which we employ the machinery of matrix product states. We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps exhibit quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost scales efficiently with system size, demonstrating the framework's scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 13 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Analysis of First- and Second-Order Optimization Algorithms in Variational Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19576v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, recent second order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first order methods. However, the relative performance of first order and second order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first order and second order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first order and second order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: second order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting away from the ground state. This makes second order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.</p></details> | 21 pages, 17 figures |

We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and non-stabilizer random circuits, with up to $1000$ qubits and $100$ layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with tens of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 153 references</p></details> |

A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</p></details> |  |

After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta<0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, proceedings of the 41st International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (LATTICE2024), 28 July - 3 August 2024, Liverpool, UK</p></details> |
| **[Chemical master equation parameter exploration using DMRG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09692v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Well-mixed chemical reaction networks (CRNs) contain many distinct chemical species with copy numbers that fluctuate in correlated ways. While those correlations are typically monitored via Monte Carlo sampling of stochastic trajectories, there is interest in systematically approximating the joint distribution over the exponentially large number of possible microstates using tensor networks or tensor trains. We exploit the tensor network strategy to determine when the steady state of a seven-species gene toggle switch CRN model supports bistability as a function of two decomposition rates, both parameters of the kinetic model. We highlight how the tensor network solution captures the effects of stochastic fluctuations, going beyond mean field and indeed deviating meaningfully from a mean-field analysis. The work furthermore develops and demonstrates several technical advances that will allow steady-states of broad classes of CRNs to be computed in a manner conducive to parameter exploration. We show that the steady-state distributions can be computed via the ordinary density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm despite having a non-Hermitian rate operator with a small spectral gap, we illustrate how that steady-state distribution can be efficiently projected to an order parameter that identifies bimodality, and we employ excited-state DMRG to calculate a relaxation timescale for the bistability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMRG study of the theta-dependent mass spectrum in the 2-flavor Schwinger model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11391v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the $\theta$-dependent mass spectrum of the massive $2$-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism using the density-matrix renormalization group(DMRG). The masses of the composite particles, the pion and sigma meson, are computed by two independent methods. One is the improved one-point-function scheme, where we measure the local meson operator coupled to the boundary state and extract the mass from its exponential decay. Since the $\theta$ term causes a nontrivial operator mixing, we unravel it by diagonalizing the correlation matrix to define the meson operator. The other is the dispersion-relation scheme, a heuristic approach specific to Hamiltonian formalism. We obtain the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy and momentum of the excited states. The sign problem is circumvented in these methods, and their results agree with each other even for large $\theta$. We reveal that the $\theta$-dependence of the pion mass at $m/g=0.1$ is consistent with the prediction by the bosonized model. We also find that the mass of the sigma meson satisfies the semi-classical formula, $M_{\sigma}/M_{\pi}=\sqrt{3}$, for almost all region of $\theta$. While the sigma meson is a stable particle thanks to this relation, the eta meson is no longer protected by the $G$-parity and becomes unstable for $\theta\neq 0$.</p></details> | 43 pages, 23 figures |

We present high-quality data collapses for the order parameter and for the entanglement entropy for three minimal models: transverse-field Ising, 3-state Potts and Ashkin-Teller. Furthermore, we show that scan-DMRG successfully captures the universal critical scaling when applied across the magnetic Wess-Zumino-Witten and non-magnetic Ising transitions in the frustrated Haldane chain. In addition, we report a universal scaling of the lowest excitation energy as a function of a gradient rate. Finally, we argue that the scan-DMRG approach has significantly lower computational cost compare to the conventional DMRG protocols to study quantum phase transitions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) have emerged as two powerful computational methods for addressing electronic correlation effects in diverse molecular systems. We compare ground-state energies ($e_0$), density profiles ($n$) and average entanglement entropies ($\bar S$) in metals, insulators and at the transition from metal to insulator, in homogeneous, superlattices and harmonically confined chains described by the fermionic one-dimensional Hubbard model. While for the homogeneous systems there is a clear hierarchy between the deviations, $D\%(\bar S)<D\%(e_0)< \bar D\%(n)$, and all the deviations decrease with the chain size; for superlattices and harmonical confinement the relation among the deviations is less trivial and strongly dependent on the superlattice structure and the confinement strength considered. For the superlattices, in general increasing the number of impurities in the unit cell represents less precision on the DFT calculations. For the confined chains, DFT performs better for metallic phases, while the highest deviations appear for the Mott and band-insulator phases. This work provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of these methodologies, shedding light on their respective strengths, limitations, and applications.</p></details> |  |

Theoretical understanding of thermoelectric conversion in organic materials is essential for rational molecular design for efficient energy conversion materials. In organic materials, non-local electron-phonon coupling plays a vital role in charge transport and leads to complex transport mechanisms, including hopping, phonon-assist current, band, and transient localization. In this work, based on time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) method, we look at the role of non-local electron-phonon coupling on the thermoelectric conversion in organic systems described by Holstein-Peierls model. We calculate the current-current correlation and the heat current-current correlation functions. We find that (i) non-local electron-phonon coupling has very weak influence on Seebeck coefficient because of the cancellation between heat current-current correlation function and the current-current correlation function, but it has strong influence on conductivity through dynamic disorders; (ii) doping concentration has a strong influence on both conductivity and Seebeck coefficient significantly, and the optimal doping ratio to reach the highest power factor is 3%-10% fillings.</p></details> |  |

The accurate determination of the magnetization of this model is challenging for numerical methods and its value exhibits substantial disparities across various methods. We perform a large-scale DMRG calculation of this model by employing bond dimension as large as $D = 24000$ and by studying the system with width as large as $L_\mathrm{y} = 12$. With careful extrapolation with truncation error and suitable finite size scaling, we give a conservative estimation of the magnetization as $M_0 = 0.208(8)$. The ground state energy per site we obtain is $E_g = -0.5503(8)$. Our results provide valuable benchmark values for the development of new methods in the future.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Traditional single-site DMRG does not allow bond expansion; two-site DMRG does, but at much higher computational costs. We present a controlled bond expansion (CBE) algorithm that yields two-site accuracy and convergence per sweep, at single-site costs. Given a matrix product state $\Psi$ defining a variational space, CBE identifies parts of the orthogonal space carrying significant weight in $H\Psi$ and expands bonds to include only these. CBE-DMRG uses no mixing parameters and is fully variational. Using CBE-DMRG, we show that the Kondo-Heisenberg model on a width 4 cylinder features two distinct phases differing in their Fermi surface volumes.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

It has the $\mathbb{Z}_q$ $1$-form symmetry and also enjoys the $\mathbb{Z}_q$ chiral symmetry in the chiral limit, and there is a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between those symmetries. We numerically study the charge-$q$ Schwinger model in the lattice Hamiltonian formulation using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG). When applying DMRG, we map the Schwinger model to a spin chain with nonlocal interaction via Jordan-Wigner transformation, and we take the open boundary condition instead of the periodic one to make the Hilbert space finite-dimensional. When computing the energy density or chiral condensate, we find that using local operators significantly reduces the boundary effect compared with the computation of corresponding extensive quantities divided by the volume. To discuss the consequence of the 't Hooft anomaly, we carefully treat the renormalization of the chiral condensates, and then we confirm that Wilson loops generate the discrete chiral transformations in the continuum limit.</p></details> | 33 pages, 12 figures |

Using large scale cylinder-DMRG calculations to obtain the ground state and its excitations as a function of the electron doping, we find clear evidence for superconductivity driven by the binding of electrons into charge-$2e$ skyrmions.

By combining parallel DMRG with $SU(2)$ spin rotational symmetry, we are able to obtain accurate results on large cylinders with length up to $L_x=48$ and circumference $L_y=6 - 12$. Our results suggest that the QSL phase of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model is gapped which is characterized by the absence of gapless mode, short-range spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations. In the presence of $J_3$ interaction, we find that a new critical QSL with a single gapless mode emerges.

The quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) algorithm proposed by Huggins et al. [Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)] addresses this challenge effectively. However, approaches such as classical and matchgate shadow tomography often require deeper circuits or large numbers of shots, making them less practical on current quantum hardware. In contrast, computational basis tomography (CBT) employs shallow circuits and is thus more suited to realistically constrained shot budgets, enabling efficient extraction of CI coefficients even with near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QC-CBT-AFQMC on molecular systems such as the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and the nitrogen molecule. The resulting potential energy curves agree closely with established classical benchmarks, including CCSD(T) and NEVPT2. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active-space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques. These results highlight the potential of QC-CBT-AFQMC as a practical method for quantum computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |

Our algorithm uses population dynamics to continuously suppress the sign problem, preventing its accumulation throughout the evolution. We apply it to a variety of quantum circuits and demonstrate significant speedups over state-of-art quantum trajectory methods and convergence to exact solutions even in non-Markovian regimes where trajectory methods fail. Our approach improves the efficiency of classical simulation of gate-based quantum computing, quantum annealing, and general open system dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[ByteQC: GPU-Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Package for Large-Scale Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17963v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying quantum chemistry algorithms to large-scale systems requires substantial computational resources scaled with the system size and the desired accuracy. To address this, ByteQC, a fully-functional and efficient package for large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, has been open-sourced at https://github.com/bytedance/byteqc, leveraging recent advances in computational power and many-body algorithms. Regarding computational power, several standard algorithms are efficiently implemented on modern GPUs, ranging from mean-field calculations (Hartree-Fock and density functional theory) to post-Hartree-Fock methods such as M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, random phase approximation, coupled cluster methods, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. For the algorithmic approach, we also employ a quantum embedding method, which significantly expands the tractable system size while preserving high accuracy at the gold-standard level. All these features have been systematically benchmarked. For standalone algorithms, the benchmark results demonstrate up to a 60$\times$ speedup when compared to 100-core CPUs. Additionally, the tractable system sizes have been significantly expanded: 1,610 orbitals for coupled cluster with single and double excitations (1,380 orbitals with perturbative triple excitations), 11,040 orbitals for M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order, 37,120 orbitals for mean-field calculations under open boundary conditions, and over 100,000 orbitals for periodic boundary conditions. For the advanced quantum embedding feature, two representative examples are demonstrated: the water cluster problem (2,752 orbitals) and a water monomer adsorbed on a boron nitride surface (3,929 orbitals), achieving the gold-standard accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Employing density matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo simulations under periodic boundary conditions, together with a systematic finite-size scaling analysis of bipartite particle number fluctuations, we resolve boundary-induced complications that previously obscured critical scaling. We demonstrate that a suitably chosen central region under open boundaries reproduces universal RG signatures, reconciling earlier discrepancies. Finally, leveraging a non-parametric Bayesian analysis, we determine the critical interaction strength with high precision, establishing a benchmark for BKT physics in one-dimensional quantum models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Ground state of the S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12911v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L > 0$, where $\mu > \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Phases and Exotic Phase Transitions of a Two-Dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07613v5)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.</p></details> | 17 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices: Metal-insulator transitions, global antiferromagnetism, and enhanced boundary fluctuations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03416v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schl\"afli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.</p></details> | 21 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the restricted Hilbert space of Rydberg atom arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00482v5)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum and restore entanglement Hamiltonian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16709v6)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reduced density matrix (RDM) plays a key role in quantum entanglement and measurement, as it allows the extraction of almost all physical quantities related to the reduced degrees of freedom. However, restricted by the degrees of freedom in the environment, the total system size is often limited, let alone the subsystem. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum Monte Carlo scheme with a low technical barrier, enabling precise extraction of the RDM. To demonstrate the power of the method, we present the fine levels of the entanglement spectrum (ES), which is the logarithmic eigenvalues of the RDM. We clearly show the ES for a $1$D ladder with a long entangled boundary, and that for the $2$D Heisenberg model with a tower of states. Furthermore, we put forward an efficient way to restore the entanglement Hamiltonian in operator-form from the sampled RDM data. Our simulation results, utilizing unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish a practical computational framework for determining entanglement quantities based on the RDM, such as the ES, particularly in scenarios where the environment has a huge number of degrees of freedom.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal~\cite{ran2024hidden} experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+7 p...</summary><p>8+7 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Non-equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for stabilizer Renyi entropy in spin systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19577v4)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures + 7 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Universal term of Entanglement Entropy in the $π$-flux Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10602v3)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

Nevertheless, relatively few non-perturbative studies of correlated SSH models have been conducted in dimensions greater than one, and those that have been done have primarily focused on bond models, where generalized displacements independently modulate each hopping integral. We conducted a sign-problem free determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of the optical SSH-Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice, where site-centered phonon modes simultaneously modulate pairs of nearest-neighbor hopping integrals. We report the model's low-temperature phase diagram in the challenging adiabatic regime ($\Omega/E_\mathrm{F} \sim 1/8$). It exhibits insulating antiferromagnetic Mott and bond-order-wave (BOW) phases with a narrow region of coexistence between them. We also find that a critical $e$-ph coupling is required to stabilize the BOW phase in the small $U$ limit. Lastly, in stark contrast to recent findings for the model's bond variant, we find no evidence for a long-range antiferromagnetism in the pure $(U/t=0)$ optical SSH model.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 pages of supplemental materials</p></details> |

By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. Physically, we first separate the free energy contribution in $2$-SRE. At quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the characteristic function contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, by analyzing the volume-law correction of magic, which represents nonlocal magic residing in correlations, we find that its discontinuity is bound to critical properties and would be more useful than the full-state magic. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

While submatrix updates were originally developed for Hirsch-Fye QMC with onsite interactions at finite temperatures [Phys. Rev. B 80, 195111 (2009)], their comprehensive application in DQMC has remained unexplored despite noted algorithmic similarities. We present the first comprehensive application of submatrix updates in DQMC, significantly extending beyond the original scope by enabling simulations with extended interactions and at zero temperature. Building upon conventional fast updates and delay updates, our generalized implementation achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, enabling simulations of the half-filled Hubbard model on lattices up to 8,000 sites - a scale previously challenging with standard DQMC implementations. This enhanced computational capability allows us to accurately determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the nonequilibrium dynamics therein has rarely been studied. To fill in the gap, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. Particularly, a new dynamic exponent characterizing the non-stationary evolution in the short-imaginary-time stage is determined as $\theta=-0.84(4)$, in sharp contrast with the prevalent belief that $\theta$ is positive as demonstrated in classical cases. Furthermore, we propose a universal dynamic scaling theory governing the fruitful nonequilibrium properties in Dirac quantum criticality. Armed with the scaling theory, we develop a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+10 ...</summary><p>7+10 pages, 5+8 figures</p></details> |

From short- and intermediate-time dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the associated values of the critical exponent. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.</p></details> |  |

This approach provides a manifold of equivalent actions over which the negative sign problem can be optimised. As a result, we can reach temperature scales well below the magnetic scale. Here, we show how to generalise this algorithm to spin-Peierls systems. In contrast to exact diagonalisation approaches, Monte Carlo methods are not Hilbert space bound such that the computational effort per sweep remains invariant when adding phonons. However, the computational effort required to generate independent configurations increases in the presence of phonons. We also show that, for the specific case of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, the inclusion of phonons does not render the negative sign problem more severe. This new algorithm hence allows us to investigate the interplay between phonon degrees of freedom and magnetic frustration. We present results for frustrated and non-frustrated spin systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, article</p></details> |

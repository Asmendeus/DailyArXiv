| **[Surface code scaling on heavy-hex superconducting quantum processors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18847v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demonstrating subthreshold scaling of a surface-code quantum memory on hardware whose native connectivity does not match the code remains a central challenge. We address this on IBM heavy-hex superconducting processors by co-designing the code embedding and control: a depth-minimizing SWAP-based "fold-unfold" embedding that uses bridge ancillas, together with robust, gap-aware dynamical decoupling (DD). On Heron-generation devices we perform anisotropic scaling from a uniform distance 3 code to anisotropic distance (dx,dz) = (3,5) and (5,3) codes. We find that increasing dz (dx) improves the protection of Z-basis (X-basis) logical states across multiple quantum error correction cycles. Even if global subthreshold code scaling for arbitrary logical initial states is not yet achieved, we argue that it is within reach with minor hardware improvements. We show that DD plays a major role: it suppresses coherent ZZ crosstalk and non-Markovian dephasing that accumulate during idle gaps on heavy-hex layouts, and it eliminates spurious subthreshold claims that arise when scaled codes without DD are compared against smaller codes with DD. To quantify performance, we derive an entanglement fidelity metric that is computed directly from X- and Z-basis logical-error data and provides per-cycle, SPAM-aware bounds. The entanglement fidelity metric reveals that widely used single-parameter fits used to compute suppression factors can mischaracterize or obscure code performance when their assumptions are violated; we identify the strong assumptions of stationarity, unitality, and negligible logical SPAM required for those fits to be valid and show that they do not hold for our data. Our results establish a concrete path to robust tests of subthreshold surface-code scaling under biased, non-Markovian noise by integrating QEC with optimized DD on non-native architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning Superconductivity in Sputtered W0.75Re0.25 Thin Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18696v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>W0.75Re0.25, in its bulk form, has been shown to be an interesting superconducting material due to its multiple crystalline phases, each exhibiting distinct superconducting characteristics. However, little is known about how these phases manifest in thin-film form, where deposition conditions and dimensionality are critical aspects. Here, we investigate superconducting W0.75Re0.25 thin films deposited via UHV dc magnetron sputtering. In order to tune the crystalline phase of the films, we further explored the effect of incorporating N2 during the deposition. The superconducting and normal-state properties as a function of deposition conditions were investigated, revealing the role of the crystal phase on the film transport properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</p></details> | <details><summary>13(+1...</summary><p>13(+19 pages appendix), 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting spin valve effect in Fe/Si$_3$N$_4$/Pb/Si$_3$N$_4$/Fe heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11333v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structures of the superconducting spin valve (SSV) Fe/Si$_3$N$_4$/Pb/Si$_3$N$_4$/Fe (where Si$_3$N$_4$ is a dielectric insulating layer of controlled thickness) were investigated. The dependence of the magnitude of the SSV effect on the thicknesses of the superconducting (S) and insulating (I) layers was studied. Optimization of the S and I layer thicknesses enabled a complete switching between the normal and superconducting states when the mutual orientation of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic (F) layers changed from antiparallel to parallel. A maximal SSV effect value of 0.36\,K was achieved in an external magnetic field of 1\,kOe. These results demonstrate that SSV structures with tunable S/F interface transparency controlled by insulating interlayers are promising for achieving a significant magnitude of the effect. This opens new avenues for the development of such systems and their potential applications in spintronic devices.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[{\it Ab initio} study of orbital-selective superconductivity in $γ$-BiPd](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14734v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting (SC) properties of experimentally realised $\gamma$-BiPd by solving the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations in conjunction with {\it ab initio} relativistic calculations of the electron and phonon band structures as well as electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix elements. Our study reveals that $\gamma$-BiPd possesses a complex Fermi surface (FS), consisting of two electron pockets and one hole pocket, each characterised by distinct atomic orbitals. Our key finding is that the superconductivity in $\gamma$-BiPd is primarily orbital-selective, arising from Bi $p$-orbitals, and distributed anisotropically on the FS, although contribution from Pd $d$-orbitals, particularly on the hole pocket, is also discernable. While our results show an anisotropic nature of the {\bf k}-dependent SC gap $\Delta_{\bf k}$ and EPC strength $\lambda_{\bf k}$ across the FS, calculated superconducting quasiparticle density of states $N_S$ spectra exhibit a U-shaped gap and $\Delta_{\bf k}$ distribution forms a single peak, being consistent with the spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity observed in this material. The calculated $T_c$ is $\sim$2.0 K, agreeing in order of magnitude with the experimental value of 3.3 K in $\gamma$-BiPd thin films. The predicted EPC-enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma_n$ of $0.141$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$ is similar to the experimental $\gamma_n$ value ($0.119$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$) of the isoelectronic and isostructural Bi(Pd$_{0.5}$Pt$_{0.5}$) alloy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Superconducting Diode Effect in the Asymmetric Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17452v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a nonreciprocal supercurrent, has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications. However, most studies have focused on weakly correlated models, leaving the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the SDE largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by investigating the SDE in asymmetric band metals with Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interaction, which are exactly solvable due to their locality in Bloch momentum space. Through a combination of low-energy analysis and a numerical self-consistent approach, we demonstrate that HK interaction can enhance the SDE's quality factor. Our findings shed light on the role of strong electron-electron correlations in shaping the SDE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong enhancement of d-wave superconductivity in an extended checkerboard Hubbard ladder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24415v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we study an extended checkerboard Hubbard model on the two-leg ladder, which includes an intraplaquette nearest-neighbour attraction V. The simulated results show that V plays a significant role in enhancing the d-wave superconductivity when the electron density is close to half-filling. In the homogeneous case t'=t (t and t' are the intraplaquette and interplaquette hopping integrals), large critical |Vc| is required to induce the superconducting ground state. With decreasing t', |Vc| is substantially diminished and the pair state has a nearly C4 symmetry. In the extremely inhomogeneous case t'<0.2t, the system transits to the d-wave superconducting phase at V\sim-0.3t and V\sim-0.4t for U=8t and U=12t, respectively, accompanying with a shift of spin and single-particle excitations from gapless to gapped type.</p></details> |  |
| **[Majorana edge modes in one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07436v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new type of one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing. We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between the intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to different phases. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Finite-temperature signatures of underlying superconductivity in the electron-doped Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16616v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perform numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model and analyze pairing tendencies by evaluating correlation functions at the imaginary-time midpoint ($\tau=\beta/2$), which suppresses high-frequency weight and emphasizes low-energy physics. Using this diagnostic, we identify clear finite-temperature signatures of underlying $d$-wave superconductivity for electron doping, while finding no clear indication upon cooling for hole doping. Our analysis enables direct comparison with ground-state DMRG, revealing consistent real-space pairing patterns. These results provide a practical route to bridge the gap between finite-temperature and ground-state numerically exact simulations of the Hubbard model despite the fermion sign problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Magnetic flux induced higher-order topological superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14216v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order topological superconductivity typically depends on spin-orbit interaction, and often necessitates well designed sample structures, nodal superconducting pairings or complex magnetic order. In this work, we propose a model that incorporates a Zeeman field, antiferromagnetic order, and $s$-wave superconducting pairing, all without the need for spin-orbit interaction. In a two-dimensional system, we realize a second-order topological superconductor by utilizing a staggered flux, provided that the Zeeman field is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic order moments. In three-dimensional systems, we achieve second- and third-order topological superconductors in theory, through stacking the two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eliashberg theory prediction of critical currents in superconducting thin films under DC electric fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17893v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting thin metallic films, functioning as supercurrent gate-tunable transistors, have considerable potential for future quantum electronic devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive microscopic quantitative mechanism that elucidates the control or suppression of supercurrents in thin films remains elusive. Focusing on NbN, a prototypical material, and starting from a phenomenological ansatz that links the critical electric field with the kinetic energy parameter needed to break Cooper pairs, we provide a quantitative analysis of the critical current using Eliashberg theory in the dirty limit without adjustable parameters. The critical kinetic energy value is identified, corresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The peak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy arises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased kinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes sufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is subsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric field required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is in parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations. Although the disorder reduces the temperature dependence of the gating effect on the critical current, at the same time, it increases the unscreened critical electric field needed to suppress superconductivity. This enables the proposal of methods to control and reduce the critical field value necessary to suppress superconductivity in superconducting electronics.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Diode effect in Shapiro steps in an asymmetric SQUID with a superconducting nanobridge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15526v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the Josephson diode effect in an asymmetric SQUID consisting of a sinusoidal Josephson junction formed by a Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se flake and a superconducting Nb nanobridge with a linear and multivalued current-phase relation (CPR). Current-voltage characteristics were measured both in the absence (dc regime) and presence (ac regime) of external microwave irradiation. Our dc measurements reveal only weak critical current asymmetry (i.e. weak Josephson diode effect), while confirming the multivalued behavior of the SQUID. At the same time, the key finding of this work is the observation of strong Shapiro step asymmetry (concerning the dc current direction) in the ac regime at finite magnetic flux. This peculiarity oscillates as a function of magnetic field with the SQUID's periodicity and varies non-monotonically with the increase in microwave power. Our theoretical model shows that the pronounced Shapiro step asymmetry, despite the small diode effect in critical current, arises from the interplay between the sinusoidal and multivalued CPRs of the junctions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Gap Engineering in Tantalum-Alloy-Based Resonators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15182v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing tantalum (Ta) in superconducting circuits has led to significant improvements, such as high qubit lifetimes and quality factors in both qubits and resonators, underscoring the importance of material optimization in quantum device performance. In this work, we explore superconducting gap engineering in Ta-based devices as a strategy to expand the range of viable host materials. By alloying 20 atomic percent hafnium (Hf) into Ta thin films, we achieve a superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of 6.09~K, as measured by DC transport, reflecting an increased superconducting gap. We systematically vary deposition conditions to control film orientation and transport properties of the Ta-Hf alloy films. The enhancement in $T_c$ is further confirmed by microwave measurements at millikelvin temperatures. Despite the 40\% increase in $T_c$ relative to pure Ta, the loss contributions from two-level systems (TLS) and quasiparticles (QPs) remain unchanged in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the potential of material engineering to improve superconducting circuit performance and motivate further exploration of engineered alloys for quantum technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity suppression and bilayer decoupling in Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15078v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14724v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures for the main text + 15 pages, 9 figures for Supplementary Materials</p></details> |
| **[Microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21346v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $\ket{001} \leftrightarrow \ket{110}$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). The protocol maintains process fidelities exceeding $98\%$ under decoherence, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced parameter variations and compatibility with existing all-microwave two-qubit gate architectures. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |
| **[Symmetry-protected states of interacting qubits in superconducting quantum circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14121v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting circuits are one of the leading candidates for storing and manipulating quantum information. Among them, qubits embedded with intrinsic noise protection have seen rapid advancements in recent years. This noise protection is typically realized by isolating the computational states from local sources of noise. Here, we propose an interacting spin model that requires at least four spins with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, where the two lowest eigenstates form a symmetry-protected qubit manifold, which is robust to both relaxation and dephasing from local perturbations. We map the spin model to a superconducting circuit and show that such a circuit can reach coherence times exceeding several milliseconds in the presence of realistic environmental noise. Our work opens a pathway to realizing qubits with long coherence times in a new generation of quantum devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Momentum-Resolved Spectroscopy of Superconductivity with the Quantum Twisting Microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13641v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a theoretical framework for probing superconductivity with momentum resolution using the quantum twisting microscope (QTM), a planar tunneling device where a graphene tip is rotated relative to a two-dimensional sample. Due to in-plane momentum conservation, the QTM directly measures the superconducting spectral function along well-defined trajectories in momentum space. The relative intensities of electron and hole excitations encode the Bogoliubov coherence factors, revealing the momentum dependence of the pairing magnitude. Three $C_{3z}$-related tunneling channels enable direct detection of rotational symmetry breaking, as well as nodal points in the superconducting order parameter. We apply our framework to superconductivity within the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of noninteracting electrons and the Topological Heavy Fermion model, which accounts for electron-electron interactions. Together, these capabilities establish the QTM as a direct probe of the pairing symmetry and microscopic origin of superconductivity in two-dimensional materials.</p></details> | 24 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In: A First-Principles Insight into Indium-Based Compounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11123v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and nontrivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis predicts a superconducting transition temperature \( T_c \approx 14\ \mathrm{K} \) at ambient pressure, which is the highest value reported so far among cubic semimetallic superconductors. When subjected to a pressure of 15 GPa, \( T_c \) increases further to 18 K. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Trapped-ion quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model as a lattice gauge theory using hardware-aware native gates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07778v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) is a simple yet rich model of strongly interacting electrons with complex dynamics and a variety of emerging quantum phases. These properties make it a compelling target for digital quantum simulation. Trotterization-based quantum simulations have shown promise, but implementations on current hardware are limited by noise, necessitating error mitigation techniques like circuit optimization and post-selection. A mapping of the FHM to a Z2 LGT was recently proposed that restricts the dynamics to a subspace protected by additional symmetries, and its ability for post-selection error mitigation was verified through noisy classical simulations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a suite of algorithm-hardware co-design strategies on a trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting two key aspects of NISQ-era quantum simulation: circuit compilation and error mitigation. In particular, a novel combination of iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) and subsystem von Neumann Entropy compression reduces the 2-qubit gate count of FHM quantum simulation by 35%, consequently doubling the number of simulatable Trotter steps when used in tandem with error mitigation based on conserved symmetries, debiasing and sharpening techniques. Our work demonstrates the value of algorithm-hardware co-design to operate digital quantum simulators at the threshold of maximum circuit depths allowed by current hardware, and is broadly generalizable to strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry and materials science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09708v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponentially long lifetime of a Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

The simulated results show that V plays a significant role in enhancing the d-wave superconductivity when the electron density is close to half-filling. In the homogeneous case t'=t (t and t' are the intraplaquette and interplaquette hopping integrals), large critical |Vc| is required to induce the superconducting ground state. With decreasing t', |Vc| is substantially diminished and the pair state has a nearly C4 symmetry. In the extremely inhomogeneous case t'<0.2t, the system transits to the d-wave superconducting phase at V\sim-0.3t and V\sim-0.4t for U=8t and U=12t, respectively, accompanying with a shift of spin and single-particle excitations from gapless to gapped type.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis enables direct comparison with ground-state DMRG, revealing consistent real-space pairing patterns. These results provide a practical route to bridge the gap between finite-temperature and ground-state numerically exact simulations of the Hubbard model despite the fermion sign problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Hybrid Brownian SYK-Hubbard Model: from Spectral Function to Quantum Chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16401v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the emergence of complex correlations in strongly interacting systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics. One fruitful approach is to develop solvable toy models that encapsulate universal properties shared by realistic systems. In this work, we introduce the Brownian SYK-Hubbard model, which combines the all-to-all random interactions of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with on-site Hubbard-type interactions. This hybrid construction enables the study of the interplay between nonlocal random dynamics and local correlation effects: (1) As the interaction strength increases, the single-particle spectrum exhibits a transition from a single peak to a two-peak structure, signaling the onset of Mottness. (2) The spectral form factor undergoes a sequence of dynamical transitions as the evolution time increases before reaching the plateau in the long-time limit under strong Hubbard interactions. (3) The out-of-time-order correlator is computed by summing a series of modified ladder diagrams, which determines the quantum Lyapunov exponent and reveals a violation of the bound on branching time. Our results establish a new analytically tractable platform for exploring the effects of Hubbard interactions in chaotic many-body systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A recipe for local simulation of strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers: the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14543v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of quantum many-body systems, relevant for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers before fault-tolerance. However, since the vast majority of quantum computing technologies are built around qubits and discrete gate-based operations, the translation of the physical problem into this framework is a crucial step. This translation will often be device specific, and a suboptimal implementation will be punished by the exponential compounding of errors on real devices. The importance of an efficient mapping is already revealed for models of spinful fermions in two or three dimensions, which naturally arise when the relevant physics relates to electrons. Using the most direct and well-known mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, leads to a non-local representation of local degrees of freedom, and necessities efficient decompositions of non-local unitary gates into a sequence of hardware accessible local gates. In this paper, we provide a step-by-step recipe for simulating the paradigmatic two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on a quantum computer using only local operations. To provide the ingredients for such a recipe, we briefly review the plethora of different approaches that have emerged recently but focus on the Derby-Klassen compact fermion mapping in order to make our discussion concrete. We provide a detailed recipe for an end-to-end simulation including embedding on a physical device, preparing initial states such as ground states, simulation of unitary time evolution, and measurement of observables and spectral functions. We explicitly compute the resource requirements for simulating a global quantum quench and conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions for simulating strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures (+6 pages appendices)</p></details> |

Our results were obtained using cluster dynamical mean field theory for the two-dimensional Hubbard model. In the weakly correlated Fermi liquid regime, both quantities are approximately symmetric around the Lifshitz transition doping $p_{LT}$. In the strongly correlated regime, the low-doping pseudogap leads to an asymmetric, discontinuous evolution when the Fermi surface changes from hole-like to electron-like at $p_{LT}$. The Lifshitz transition thus changes character because it is tied to the pseudogap-Fermi-liquid transition. These results are consistent with available observations and should foster further experimental investigations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

In particular, we obtain expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and stress tensor suitable for real-space finite-difference discretization, and develop a large-scale parallel implementation. We verify the accuracy of the formalism through comparisons with established planewave results. We demonstrate that the implementation is highly efficient and scalable, outperforming established planewave codes by more than an order of magnitude in minimum time to solution, with increasing advantages as the system size and/or number of processors is increased. We apply this framework to examine the impact of exchange-correlation inconsistency in local atomic orbital generation and introduce a scheme for optimizing the Hubbard parameter based on hybrid functionals, both while studying TiO$_2$ polymorphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The detailed analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory, allowed us to interpret the found triangular-lattice phases and provided a great insight into the mechanisms behind the phase transitions that can also be met when correlation effects are taken into account. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 80 references; RevTeX class, double-column formatting, includes also Supplemental Material (5 pages, 3 figures, 9 multimedia filies); minor additions with respect to previous version</p></details> |

The method determines vertex corrections in the spin and charge channels self-consistently at the two-particle level, thereby avoiding the spurious finite-temperature phase transitions that limit dynamical mean-field theory in two dimensions. We derive the spectral self-energy and implement the framework directly on the real-frequency axis within the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, enabling the treatment of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states without relying on numerical analytic continuation. As an application, we demonstrate that a pseudogap can emerge in the bilayer Hubbard model when spin, charge, or excitonic fluctuations become sufficiently strong. Instabilities in different channels are also evaluated in an unbiased manner across the parameter space. Remarkably, we find that the excitonic susceptibility grows with increasing interlayer bias, before it gets suppressed at large biases by the charge imbalance between the layers. This work establishes a versatile and computationally efficient framework for investigating correlated multi-orbital systems under nonequilibrium conditions.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Here we access this paradigm, by confining dipolar excitons in a nanoscopic lattice where long-range hopping, and nearest-neighbour dipolar repulsions, dress the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Long-range hopping is evidenced by the spontaneous buildup of many-body sub-radiance, signalled by an algebraic slowdown of excitons radiative dissipation. In addition, we observe a threshold increase of temporal coherence for dipolar quantum solids only. It suggests that excitons condense in a single sub-radiant state for Mott-like phases. These combine then spatial order and collectively extended coherence, in a single degree of freedom. Our study unveils that nanoscopic exciton arrays provide a unique platform to design new frontiers of strongly-correlated lattice models with long-range correlations.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

Here, on the basis of systematic investigations for the hole doped single-layer Haldane-Hubbard(HH) model, we propose a new bilayer HH model to realize the compensated odd-parity spin splitting and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity where the two layers are connected by the time reversal transformation. Our results show that the vanishing layer-dependent electric potential $V_{L}$ gives rise to odd-parity ALM protected by the combined symmetry $TM_{xy}$ with $T$ and $M_{xy}$ being the time reversal and mirror reflection perpendicular to $z$ axis, and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity simultaneously. In addition, though the staggered magnetization within each layer is substantially impacted by the layer-dependent electric potential, small $V_{L}$'s only bring negligible changes to the net magnetization and the spin Hall conductivity, indicating that the alternating spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity are insusceptible to external elements. Most importantly, our work provides a general framework for the simultaneous realization of the compensated odd-parity spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity in collinear magnets, in terms of stacked multi-layer systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, Neural Quantum States are used to probe the strongly coupled and underdoped regime of the square-lattice Hubbard model. We systematically compare the Hidden Fermion Determinant State and the Jastrow-Backflow ansatz, parametrized by a Vision Transformer, finding that in practice, their accuracy is similar. We also test different symmetrization strategies, finding that output averaging yields the lowest energies, though it becomes costly for larger system sizes. On cylindrical systems, we consistently observe filled stripes. On the torus, our calculations display features consistent with a doped Mott insulator, including antiferromagnetic correlations and suppressed density fluctuations. Our results demonstrate both the promise and current challenges of neural quantum states for correlated fermions.</p></details> |  |

We analyze how initially stable uniform distributions evolve into self-trapped (localized) regimes and the influence of a refractive index detuning selectively applied along the diagonal waveguides on this transition. This detuning effectively emulates the effect of on-site Hubbard-like interactions $U$ in photonic analogs of interacting particles in a one-dimensional lattice. While for $U = 0$ the system exhibits the known direct transition from stable uniform states to asymptotically localized profiles, we show that $U > 0$ induces an emergence of intermediate dynamical regimes. These regimes include coherent breathing modes that can be either confined along diagonal or off-diagonal waveguides, as well as chaotic-like propagation patterns. At higher nonlinearities, we identify distinct self-trapped regimes characterized by diagonal or off-diagonal localized modes, depending on the strength of $U$. The critical nonlinear strengths separating the existing regimes are shown in the phase diagram, underscoring the competing trends imposed by the Hubbard-like interaction on the optical field.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor corrections and appendix additions in version 3</p></details> |

Our approach avoids encoding directly the original fermions into qubits and instead relies on reformulating the original model onto a system of fermions coupled to spins and then decoupling them in a self-consistent manner. We then introduce the auxiliary spin solver: this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm handles a free-fermion problem, which can be solved efficiently with a few classical resources, and an interacting spin problem, which can be naturally encoded in the analog quantum computer. This algorithm can be used to study both the equilibrium Mott transition as well as non-equilibrium properties of the original Fermi-Hubbard model, highlighting the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches to study strongly correlated matter.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (including Methods), 3 figures, 1 page of SM</p></details> |

Unfortunately, interaction-driven phenomena such as the transition into the strongly correlated Mott insulator phase are difficult to treat with established theoretical techniques. However, the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model displays similar Mott physics. Here we show how the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model can be deformed continuously into the Hubbard model. The trick is to systematically re-introduce all the momentum mixing the original Hatsugai-Kohmoto model omits. This can be accomplished by grouping $n$-momenta into a cell and hybridizing them resulting in the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto (MMHK) model. We recover the Bethe ansatz ground state energy of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to within 1$\%$ from only ten mixed momenta. Overall the convergence scales as $1/n^2$ as opposed to the inverse linear behaviour of standard finite-cluster techniques. Our results for a square lattice reproduce all known features from state-of-the-art simulations also with only a few mixed momenta. Consequently, we believe the MMHK model offers an alternative tool for strongly correlated quantum matter.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + supplement (greatly expanded revision)</p></details> |
| **[Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01856v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$, next-nearest-neighbor hopping strengths $t'$ and boundary conditions. Instead of considering backflow terms from all sites, competitive results are achieved by considering nearest-neighbor or next-nearest-neighbor backflow terms. Meanwhile the variational wave-function is not enforced on geometric symmetries. When $t'$=0, by considering nearest-neighbor backflow terms, linear stripe order is sucessfully obtained for the case of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under periodoc boundary condition. For a similar case under open boundary condition, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. Comparing to state-of-the-art neural network results, energies are competitive and relative errors are below $5\times 10^{-3}$. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations. When $t'$=-0.2, by considering next-nearest-neighbor backflow terms, obtained energies are competitive or even lower than state-of-the-art neural network results. For example, obtained energy for $n$=0.875, $U$=8 on the $12\times 12$ lattice under PBC is $8.1\times 10^{-4}$ lower comparing to that from the neural network state. Therefore, the Tensor-Backflow method has strong representation abilities for the Fermi-Hubbard model.</p></details> |  |

This model provides insight into a range of phenomena in correlated electron systems. We wish to examine the paradigm of quantum algorithms for solving such many-body problems. The focus of our current work is on the one-dimensional model which is integrable, meaning that there exist analytical results for determining its ground state. In particular, we demonstrate how to perform a gate-based quantum computer simulation of quantum annealing for the Hubbard Hamiltonian. We perform simulations for systems with up to 40 qubits to study the scaling of required annealing time for obtaining the ground state. We find that for the half-filled cases considered, there is a substantial quantum speed-up over algorithms based on the Bethe-ansatz equations.</p></details> |  |

We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($\delta\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity in a bilayer $t$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07545v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Here, we address this by synthesizing high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$) with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice, particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$ rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm 2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the $c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/\AA, demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

The quest to understand the governing principles of RP nickelate superconductivity has become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we report a critical advance by synthesizing and investigating a distinct structural polymorph of the same compound: the monolayer-trilayer (1313) hybrid phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Under high pressure, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic $Cmmm$ to the tetragonal $P4/mmm$ space group at 13~GPa. Above 19 GPa, the phase exhibits a clear superconducting transition, confirmed by a zero-resistance state, albeit at a significantly reduced temperature of 3.6 K. The stark contrast with the 80 K transition in the bilayer phase provides a uniquely clean experimental comparison. Our results demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature is directly governed by the nature of the interlayer coupling, and the bilayer NiO$_6$ block as the essential structural motif for achieving high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity in the RP nickelates.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, supplemental material</p></details> |

Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By applying the dynamical cluster approximation and the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation, we identify an Anderson localization transition at a critical doping of $\delta \sim 0.2$ through the geometric average of the local density of states. This Anderson localization transition is the key reason for the suppression of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures and Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

Previous studies have proposed an effective d$_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model, in which the electrons of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are charge carriers, which are subject to the intralayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange $J_{\parallel}$ and the large interlayer AFM superexchange $J_{\perp}\approx 2J_{\parallel}$, with the latter transferred from the nearly half-filled and hence localized $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the strong Hund's rule coupling. Here we study this model by the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation and find a dominant interlayer s-wave pairing, in which the SC order parameters have a drastic improvement compared with those of the mean field (MF) type of theories. In real materials, the Hund's coupling is finite, leading to reduced $J_{\perp}$, dictating that the MF-type theories have difficulty explaining the HTSC. However, our VMC calculations find that even for effective $J_{\perp}$ as weak as $J_{\perp}=J_{\parallel}$, the interlayer pairing is still considerably large and can be compared with the $T_c$ observed in experiments, which is very weak in MF-type theories. This result indicates the important role of the Gutzwiller projection in improving the $T_c$, which is ignored in the MF-type theories. In addition, our results show that suppressed interlayer hopping can promote interlayer pairing, which is consistent with the fact that the interlayer hopping of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is very weak. Our research offers a new perspective for understanding the pairing mechanism of bilayer nickelates and provides a reference for recent ultra-cold atom experiments in mixed-dimensional systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

Here we propose to broadly expand the choices of materials platforms to achieve high-Tc superconducting La3Ni2O7 films by proposing designer substrates of Ba1-xSrxO (x = 0 - 1) that allow to continuously tune the strain in the films from being tensile to compressive. Our systematic study of the structural and electronic reconstructions of the strained La3Ni2O7 bilayer film leads to the central finding that at the optimal tensile strain of ~2% (x ~0.25), the spectral weight of the Ni dz2 orbital is peaked right at the Fermi level, and its hybridization with the Ni dx2-y2 orbital is substantially enhanced. Consequently, the expected Tc should be unprecedentedly high, at least substantially higher than those achieved in the compressive regime. Furthermore, our detailed thickness-dependent energetic analyses show that such films can be stably grown for thicknesses equal to or beyond the bilayer regime, and predict that the SrO-terminated SrTiO3 should also be able to stabilize the films with optimal tensile strain and higher Tc's.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce in situ directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation, differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors.

However, due to the challenges of directly probing the superconducting pairing mechanism under high pressure, the pairing symmetry and gap structures of nickelate superconductors remain under intense debate. In this work, we successfully determine the microscopic information on the superconducting gap structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ samples subjected to pressures exceeding 20~GPa, by constructing different conductance junctions within diamond anvil cells. By analyzing the temperature-dependent differential conductance spectra within the Blonder--Tinkham--Klapwijk (BTK) model, we have determined the superconducting energy gap at high pressure. The differential conductance curves reveal a two-gap structure with $\Delta_{1} = 23~\mathrm{meV}$ and $\Delta_{2} = 6~\mathrm{meV}$, while the BTK fitting is consistent with an $s$-like, two-gap spectrum. The gap ratio $2\Delta_{s1}(0) / k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{c}$ is found to be 7.61, belonging to a family of strongly coupled superconductors.

Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_2$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have reported superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-delta under pressure, with zero-resistance near 80 K, though the Meissner effect remains debated due to low superconducting volume fractions and limited high-pressure magnetic measurement techniques. In this work, we use diamond quantum sensors and four-probe detection to observe both zero resistance and the Meissner effect in the same La3Ni2O7-delta single crystal. By mapping the Meissner effect, we visualized superconducting regions and revealed sample inhomogeneities. Our combined magnetic and electrical measurements on the same crystal provide dual evidence of superconductivity, supporting the high-temperature superconductivity of La3Ni2O7-delta. This study also offers insights into its structural and magnetic properties under high pressure.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 19 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory.

| **[Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15322v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $\chi^b > \chi^a > \chi^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $\chi^a > \chi^c > \chi^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |

In ultra-clean single crystals, we identify a field-induced phase transition within the superconducting state at 5.6 T, driven by metamagnetism. This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nodal superconducting gap structure and topological surface states of UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11603v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Magnetic penetration depth in topological superconductors: Effect of Majorana surface states and application for UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18441v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we examine how the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons and Majorana surface states influence the magnetic penetration depth in the superconductor UTe$_2$. We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($\kappa$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$\kappa$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $\kappa$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[UTe$_2$: a narrow band superconductor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07915v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted as regular article</p></details> |
| **[Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15147v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasiparticle Interference of Spin-Triplet Superconductors: Application to UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01404v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasiparticle interference (QPI) obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful method to help extract the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors. We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</p></details> | 21 pages. 17 figures |

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18564v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Revealing isotropic abundant low-energy excitations in UTe$_2$ through complex microwave surface impedance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07955v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex surface impedance is a well-established tool to study the super- and normal-fluid responses of superconductors. Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $\Delta \lambda(T) \sim T^\alpha$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $\alpha < 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{\alpha_R}$ with $\alpha_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.</p></details> | 29 pages, 23 figures |

This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state. Taking into account the large decrease in $K_a$ in the SC state, we conclude that the $\boldsymbol{d}$ vector has components along all three crystal axes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 Figures + Supplemental Material with 18 pages, 16 Figures</p></details> |

A single, sharp superconducting transition is observed at low pressures 0.3 GPa. At higher pressure, a second feature emerges in $\chi(T)$, which is located at the lower-temperature thermodynamic phase boundary previously identified in specific heat measurements. This second transition anomaly in $\chi(T)$ can be attributed to a step change in the London penetration depth, providing direct evidence for a change in the superconducting order parameter of UTe$_2$. Thermodynamic constraints suggest that the low temperature, high pressure superconducting state is distinct from zero pressure superconductivity as well as from the high pressure, high temperature superconducting state, raising the possibility of multicomponent superconductivity in high pressure UTe$_2$.</p></details> |  |

| **[Electronic structure of UTe$_2$ under pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04292v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A heavy-fermion paramagnet UTe$_2$ has been a strong candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |

The surface flat bands originate from topological features supported by two key mechanisms: (1) a trivial Chern number prevents the zero-energy states from merging into the continuum of the bulk spectrum, thereby ensuring their confinement within the superconducting gap; and (2) weak spin conservation allows the gap function to exhibit phase winding. As a consequence, the surface exhibits a remarkably high density of states at nearly zero energy. Such surface states are likely to be realized in the candidate topological superconductor UTe$_2$. Our results provide important insights into the interpretation of recent Josephson STM experiments on UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 5 pages + 9 pages |

| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi-liquids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982v3)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum xy model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moir\'{e} twisted bi-layer graphene and bi-layer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear in temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those due to Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln \omega_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi-surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi-surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p></details> | 65 pages, 10 figures |

Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $\theta$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $\pi$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital Altermagnetism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00509v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of \emph{orbital altermagnetism}, a symmetry-protected magnetic order of pure orbital degrees of freedom. It is characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking. First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$, so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand, it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO. The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.</p></details> | 16 Page, 9 Figures |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagomé metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting state in a kagom\'e lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Ordered phases and superconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems subject to pair spin-orbit interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06190v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pair spin-orbit interaction can emerge in strongly-interacting systems characterized by a large spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagom\'e lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagom\'e lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagom\'e metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagom\'e lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |

However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120{\deg}, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Connecting such bosonic $\pi$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $\pi$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04601v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loop current order on the kagome lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01648v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent discoveries in kagome materials have unveiled their capacity to harbor exotic quantum states, including intriguing charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+3 p...</summary><p>9+3 pages, 10 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

For pure states, the representatives of phases are the ground states of locally interacting Hamiltonians, which are also renormalization fixed points (RFPs). These RFP states are exactly described by tensor networks. Extending this framework to mixed states, matrix product density operators (MPDOs) which are RFPs are believed to encapsulate mixed-state phases of matter in one dimension, where non-trivial topological phases have already been shown to exist. However, to better motivate the physical relevance of those states, and in particular the physical relevance of the recently found non-trivial phases, it remains an open question whether such MPDO RFPs can be realized as steady states of local Lindbladians. In this work, we resolve this question by analytically constructing parent Lindbladians for MPDO RFPs. These Lindbladians are local, frustration-free, and exhibit minimal steady-state degeneracy. Interestingly, we find that parent Lindbladians possess a rich structure that distinguishes them from their Hamiltonian counterparts. In particular, we uncover an intriguing connection between the non-commutativity of the Lindbladian terms and the fact that the corresponding MPDO RFP belongs to a non-trivial phase.</p></details> | 42 pages |

In a recent work [Phys. Rev. X 15, 031065 (2025)], we introduced a new truncation scheme -- here renamed as Renormalized Dual Basis (RDB) -- based on the resolution of the single-plaquette problem, and demonstrated its performance for SU(2) LGTs. In this paper, we apply the RDB to compact quantum electrodynamics (cQED) in three spacetime dimensions (2+1D). We variationally determine the ground state of the theory for small lattices with periodic (for pure gauge) and open (in presence of fermionic matter) boundary conditions, achieving improved precision for the plaquette operator compared to previous approaches. By leveraging tensor networks, we extend the study to larger lattices and demonstrate the scalability of the method. Overall, we show that the RDB provides an efficient description across all coupling regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + 11 pages appendix/references, 8 figures</p></details> |

To provide accurate noise information to the decoder in parallel with quantum computation, an adaptive estimation of the noise model based on syndrome measurement statistics is an effective approach. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-established for Pauli noise, it remains unexplored for more complex and realistic scenarios such as amplitude damping which cannot be represented as a Pauli channel. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference methods for general noise models, integrating a tensor network simulator of surface code, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic scenario, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present numerical results of applying our proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and nonuniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N = 480 for toric code, N=1584 for Rydberg PXP), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation.

Tensor network methods have long been established as powerful approximation schemes, and their efficiency can be further enhanced by incorporating physics-informed priors. A prominent example is symmetry: recent progress on $U(1)$-symmetric tensor networks, accelerated on GPUs and scaled to supercomputers, shows how conserved charges induce block-sparse structures that reduce computational cost and enable larger simulations. The same principle extends to general symmetries, inspiring equivariant neural networks in machine learning and guiding symmetry-preserving ansatze in variational quantum algorithms. Beyond symmetry, physics-informed design also includes strategies such as hybrid tensor networks and parallel sequential circuits, which pursue efficiency from complementary principles. This Perspective argues that physics-informed tensor networks, grounded in both symmetry and beyond-symmetry insights, provide unifying strategies for scalable approaches in quantum simulation, computation, and machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission for 2025 IEEE Workshop on Quantum IntelLigence, Learning & Security (QUILLS), https://sites.google.com/view/quills2025/home</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Learning to Recognize Quantum Phases of Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14742v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drawing the quantum phase diagram of a many-body system in the parameter space of its Hamiltonian can be seen as a learning problem, which implies labelling the corresponding ground states according to some classification criterium that defines the phases. In this work we adopt unsupervised learning, where the algorithm has no access to any priorly labeled states, as a tool for determining quantum phase diagrams of many-body systems. The algorithm directly works with quantum states: given the ground-state configurations for different values of the Hamiltonian parameters, the process uncovers the most significant way of grouping them based on a similarity criterion that refers to the fidelity between quantum states, that can be easily estimated, even experimentally. We benchmark our method with two specific spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains, with states determined via tensor network techniques. We find that unsupervised learning algorithms based on spectral clustering, combined with ``silhouette'' and ``elbow'' methods for determining the optimal number of phases, can accurately reproduce the phase diagrams. Our results show how unsupervised learning can autonomously recognize and possibly unveil novel phases of quantum matter.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Expectation value estimation with parametrized quantum circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19499v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating properties of quantum states, such as fidelities, molecular energies, and correlation functions, is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Due to the limitation of practical quantum devices, including limited circuit depth and connectivity, estimating even linear properties encounters high sample complexity. To address this inefficiency, we propose a framework that optimizes sample complexity for estimating the expectation value of any observable using a shallow parameterized quantum circuit. Within this framework, we introduce two decomposition algorithms, a tensor network approach and a greedy projection approach that decompose the target observable into a linear combination of multiple observables, each of which can be diagonalized with the shallow circuit. Using this decomposition, we then apply an importance sampling algorithm to estimate the expectation value of the target observable. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by estimating the expectation values of some specific Hamiltonians and inner product of a Slater determinant with a pure state, highlighting advantages compared to some conventional methods. Additionally, we derive the fundamental lower bound for the sample complexity required to estimate a target observable using a given shallow quantum circuit, thereby enhancing our understanding of the capabilities of shallow circuits in quantum learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major update to methods and numerics; a new co-author has been added</p></details> |

Traditional numerical methods often become prohibitively expensive under these conditions. Quantum computing and quantum-inspired methods have been investigated as promising alternatives. This review surveys advances at the intersection of quantum computing, quantum algorithms, machine learning, and tensor network techniques for CFD. We discuss the use of Variational Quantum Algorithms as hybrid quantum-classical solvers for PDEs, emphasizing their ability to incorporate nonlinearities through Quantum Nonlinear Processing Units. We further review Quantum Neural Networks and Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks, which extend classical machine learning frameworks to quantum hardware and have shown advantages in parameter efficiency and solution accuracy for certain CFD benchmarks. Beyond quantum computing, we examine tensor network methods, originally developed for quantum many-body systems and now adapted to CFD as efficient high-dimensional compression and solver tools. Reported studies include several orders of magnitude reductions in memory and runtime while preserving accuracy. Together, these approaches highlight quantum and quantum-inspired strategies that may enable more efficient CFD solvers. This review closes with perspectives: quantum CFD remains out of reach in the NISQ era, but quantum-inspired tensor networks already show practical benefits, with hybrid approaches offering the most promising near-term strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages + 23 pages of appendices, 11 figures</p></details> |

We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. {In terms of a previous conjecture on the characteristic scaling of LOE, our results also mean that non-integrable spin chains cannot be simulated classically}. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + appendices, 2 figures, comments welcome! v2/3: added references, restructured results</p></details> |

However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entanglement and the density matrix renormalisation group in the generalised Landau paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06334v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fields of entanglement theory and tensor networks have recently emerged as central tools for characterising quantum phases of matter. In this article, we determine the entanglement structure of ground states of gapped symmetric quantum lattice models, and use this to obtain the most efficient tensor network representation of those ground states. We do this by showing that degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum arise through a duality transformation of the original model to the unique dual model where the entire dual (generalised) symmetry is spontaneously broken and subsequently no degeneracies are present. Physically, this duality transformation amounts to a (twisted) gauging of the unbroken symmetry in the original ground state. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that completely breaks the symmetry minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional tensor network methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the practical simulation of strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, v2: minor corrections</p></details> |
| **[Measurement-induced entanglement in noisy 2D random Clifford circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12743v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study measurement-induced entanglement generated by column-by-column sampling of noisy 2D random Clifford circuits of size $N$ and depth $T$. Focusing on the operator entanglement $S_{\rm op}$ of the sampling-induced boundary state, first, we reproduce in the noiseless limit a finite-depth transition from area- to volume-law scaling. With on-site probablistic trace noise at any constant rate $p>0$, the maximal $S_{\rm op}$ attained along the sampling trajectory obeys an area law in the boundary length and scales approximately linearly with $T/p$. By analyzing the spatial distribution of stabilizer generators, we observe exponential localization of stabilizer generators; this both accounts for the scaling of the maximal $S_{\rm op}$ and implies an exponential decay of conditional mutual information across buffered tripartitions, which we also confirm numerically. Together, these results indicate that constant local noise destroys long-range, volume-law measurement-induced entanglement in 2D random Clifford circuits. Finally, based on the observed scaling, we conjecture that a tensor-network-based algorithm can efficiently sample from noisy 2D random Clifford circuits (i) at sub-logarithmic depths $T = o(\log N)$ for any constant noise rate $p = \Omega(1)$, and (ii) at constant depths $T = O(1)$ for noise rates $p = \Omega(\log^{-1}N)$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of qutrits useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate microwave pulse gates to a low error rate to operate transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki), which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena, such as topologically protected ground states, string order, and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. To establish the advantage of qutrits over qubits in the presence of noise, we present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase using tensor network simulations. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension $\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\chi$ as $2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required $\chi$s are much smaller than the worst case.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

We develop an efficient algorithm for simulating both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics in large one-dimensional quantum systems. Extending the Tensor Jump Method, which combines TDVP-based tensor-network evolution with a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of stochastic trajectories, our approach incorporates time-dependent decay rates-treating positive rates as time-inhomogeneous Markovian processes and negative rates via the Influence Martingale formalism to unravel time-local non-Markovian dynamics. This resource-efficient framework enables scalable simulations of open-system dynamics in the non-Markovian regime, as demonstrated for a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising chain comprising up to 100 spin qubits.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |

However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such a triple-layer network, which reduces the computational complexity while keeping high accuracy. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |

In the unfrustrated regime, the model exhibits a quantum ferrimagnetic phase that captures key magnetic features of the nickel-based polymeric compound [Ni3(OH)2(C4H2O4)(H2O)4].2H2O such as a at minimum in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility times temperature product and an intermediate one-third magnetization plateau. In the frustrated regime, we uncover a rich variety of unconventional quantum phases including uniform and cluster-based Haldane states, fragmented monomer-dimer phase, and bound-magnon crystals. Analysis of the adiabatic temperature change and magnetic Gruneisen parameter reveals an enhanced magnetocaloric effect near field-induced transitions between these exotic quantum phases.

Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal nonlocal anticorrelations in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-equivalent DSSF closely matches Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for kBT/J ~ 1, extending the applicability of classical dynamics to the challenging case of gapless excitations. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions for uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Entanglement witnesses derived from the quantum-equivalent DSSF act as sensitive diagnostics for the quantum-to-classical crossover. Their reliability stems from their dependence on spectral features alone, enabling classical dynamics to emulate quantum thresholds without genuine entanglement. This framework also reproduces transverse spin correlations in finite magnetic fields, in agreement with quantum simulations. Together, our results establish quantum-corrected classical dynamics as a scalable and predictive tool for interpreting scattering experiments and exploring quantum correlations in strongly correlated spin systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, and supplementary information; improved finite-field analysis</p></details> |

Both the experimentally observed smeared region and the theoretically predicted marginal Fermi liquid suggest that spatial disorder seems to be an important driver of these phenomena. By performing large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations in the ferromagnetic spin-fermion model at finite $N$, beyond the large-$N$ used in previous theoretical work, we investigated the role of spatial disorder in the critical Fermi surface (FS) of this model. We proposed a corrected theory of our system, which is based on a modified Eliashberg theory and a universal theory of strange metals. This theory agrees well with the data obtained from DQMC, particularly in capturing the $\omega \ln \omega$ type self-energy characteristic of marginal Fermi liquid behavior, and observing the linear-in-temperature resistivity. Our findings offer strong and unbiased validation of the universal theory of strange metals, broaden the applicability of the modified Eliashberg theory, and provide insights for numerically searching for marginal Fermi liquid and linear-in-temperature resistivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+21...</summary><p>10+21 pages, 4+17 figures, 0+2 tables</p></details> |

Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+16 ...</summary><p>5+16 pages; updated main text and Supp. Mat</p></details> |

Using this diagnostic, we identify clear finite-temperature signatures of underlying $d$-wave superconductivity for electron doping, while finding no clear indication upon cooling for hole doping. Our analysis enables direct comparison with ground-state DMRG, revealing consistent real-space pairing patterns. These results provide a practical route to bridge the gap between finite-temperature and ground-state numerically exact simulations of the Hubbard model despite the fermion sign problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Visualizing the Impact of Quenched Disorder on 2D Electron Wigner Solids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12009v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electron Wigner solids (WSs)1-12 provide an ideal system for understanding the competing effects of electron-electron and electron-disorder interactions, a central unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Progress in this topic has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density ($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$ devices with varying long-range ($n_\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range ($n_\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the magnitude of $n_\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\mathrm{SR} \lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\mathrm{SR} \gg n_e$ these features are suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher $n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a combined experimental-theoretical approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring molecular supersolidity via exact and mean-field theories: single microwave shielding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18051v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold polar molecules with microwave shielding provide a powerful platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with strong, anisotropic interactions. We develop an extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework for bosonic molecules under single microwave shielding, incorporating effective interactions and quantum fluctuations, and benchmark it against exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the regime of positive scattering lengths, our approach captures superfluid, supersolid, and droplet phases with excellent accuracy. We show that elliptic microwave polarization induces direction-dependent superfluidity--absent in cylindrically symmetric systems. A quasi-1D theory reveals that roton softening and instabilities can be controlled via ellipticity, consistent with recent experiments. Furthermore, we find that the nature of the superfluid-to-supersolid transition is strongly influenced by the ellipticity: the transition is sharp at low ellipticity and continuous at higher values. This tunability offers a potential route for low entropy preparation of molecular supersolids via adiabatic ramps. While double shielding is often used experimentally, our results demonstrate that single-shielded molecules already offer rich, controllable behavior, laying the groundwork for future studies with more complex shielding schemes.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of quantum magnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+11 ...</summary><p>9+11 pages, 3+8 figures</p></details> |

We implement and extend the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm of Wu, Deng, and Prokof'ev on the square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices with open and periodic boundaries, respectively. The package is expandable to arbitrary lattice geometries and custom observables diagonal in either the $X$- or $Z$-basis. ParaToric also supports snapshot extraction in both bases, making it ideal for generating training/benchmarking data for other methods, such as lattice gauge theories, cold atom or other quantum simulators, quantum spin liquids, artificial intelligence, and quantum error correction. The software provides bindings to C/C++ and Python, and is thus almost universally integrable into other software projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Interplay of magnetic and thermodynamic responses in the kagome-triangular system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13530v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the recent experimental progress in pyrochlore derivative \ce{RE3Sb3A2O14 (A=Mg, Zn)}, we investigate the Hubbard model on the kagome lattice with an additional hopping $t'/t$, which enables continuous interpolation between the kagome and triangular lattices by using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We analyze the evolution of magnetic correlations and thermodynamic responses across different values of $t'/t$ and on-site interaction $U$. It is found that increasing $t'/t$ suppresses short-range antiferromagnetic correlations, while the next-nearest-neighbor correlations exhibit a sign change near $t'/t \approx 0.3 \text{--} 0.4$. Within this regime, the specific heat shows a pronounced low-temperature peak, indicating an emergent spin-related energy scale. Increasing $U$ enhances magnetic correlations and shifts the associated $t'/t$ crossover points to larger values. We also discuss the sign problem to clarify which parameter region of our numerical simulations is accessible and reliable. Our results uncover the competition between frustration and correlations and the interplay of magnetic and thermodynamic responses in the kagome lattice, providing insights into correlated states in frustrated materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Scalable Quantum Monte Carlo Method for Polariton Chemistry via Mixed Block Sparsity and Tensor Hypercontraction Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11634v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a reduced-scaling auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework designed for large molecular systems and ensembles, with or without coupling to optical cavities. Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniformity Bias in Ground-State Sampling Induced by Replica Alignment in Quantum Monte Carlo for Quantum Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10566v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum annealing (QA) with a transverse field often fails to sample degenerate ground states fairly, limiting applicability to problems requiring diverse optimal solutions. Although Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is widely used to simulate QA, its ability to reproduce such unfair ground-state sampling remains unclear because stochastic and coherent quantum dynamics differ fundamentally. We quantitatively evaluate how accurately QMC reproduces the sampling bias in QA by comparing the final ground-state distributions from the QMC master equation and the Schr\"odinger equation. We find QMC tends to produce uniform ground-state probabilities, unlike QA's biased distribution, and that this uniformity bias strengthens as annealing proceeds. Our analysis reveals that this bias originates from replica alignment -- the dominance of configurations in which all Trotter replicas coincide -- caused by the energetic suppression and entropic reduction of kink configurations (replica mismatches). These findings clarify a fundamental limitation of discrete-time QMC in faithfully simulating QA dynamics, highlighting the importance of replica correlations and transition rules in achieving realistic ground-state sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing quantum computations with the synergy of auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo and computational basis tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20066v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce QC-CBT-AFQMC, a hybrid algorithm that incorporates computational basis tomography (CBT) into the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) method proposed by Huggins et al. [Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)], replacing the use of classical shadows. While the original QC-AFQMC showed high accuracy for quantum chemistry calculations, it required exponentially costly post-processing. Subsequent work using Matchgate shadows [Commun. Math. Phys. 404, 629 (2023)] improved scalability, but still suffers from prohibitive computational requirements that limit practical applications. Our QC-CBT-AFQMC approach uses shallow Clifford circuits with a quadratic reduction of two-qubit gates over the original algorithm, significantly reducing computational requirements and enabling accurate calculations under limited measurement budgets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and nitrogen molecule, producing potential energy curves that closely match established benchmarks. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques. These results highlight QC-CBT-AFQMC as a practical quantum-classical hybrid method that bridges the capabilities of quantum devices and accurate chemical simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable tensor network algorithm for quantum impurity problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12722v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

The impurity, or polaron, is an interesting system in both cold atomic and nuclear physics. Our approach is general, and we are able to straightforwardly study the polaron across these regimes. We first study the Fermi polaron at unitarity and for a wide range of scattering lengths, comparing against previous theoretical and experimental studies. We then explore the neutron polaron which has been shown to be an important constraint for nuclear physics. We have also employed the recently developed parametric matrix model to emulate AFQMC solutions to the two-body problem on the lattice, to accelerate the tuning of our lattice Hamiltonian parameters directly to two-body energies in a periodic box, following Lscher's formula. Our lattice Quantum Monte Carlo results for the polaron in both a cold atomic and nuclear physics context can serve as stringent benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental research.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Boundary criticality in two-dimensional correlated topological superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05230v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of a boundary enriches the nature of quantum phase transitions. However, the boundary critical phenomena in topological superconductors remain underexplored so far. Here, we investigate the boundary criticality in a two-dimensional correlated time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor tuned through a quantum phase transition into a trivial time-reversal-breaking superconductor. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we chart the quantum phase diagram and reveal the boundary criticalities encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Additionally, using renormalization group analysis, we compute the boundary critical exponent up to two loops. Remarkably, the simulations and two-loop renormalization group calculations consistently demonstrate that the presence of the boundary Majorana fermion at the special transition gives rise to a new type of boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa fixed point. We conclude with a discussion of possible experimental realizations in iron-based superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+4 p...</summary><p>7+4 pages, 3+4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[NNQS-AFQMC: Neural network quantum states enhanced fermionic quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07540v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ans\"atze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recently it has been shown (Xiao et al, arXiv2505.18519) that a broad class of highly correlated wave-functions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we apply this approach and present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ab initio calculation of atomic solid hydrogen phases based on Gutzwiller many-body wave functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02064v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply two ab initio many-body methods based on Gutzwiller wave functions, i.e., correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) and Gutzwiller conjugate gradient minimization (GCGM), to the study of crystalline phases of atomic hydrogen. Both methods avoid empirical Hubbard U parameters and are free from double-counting issues. CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by including the correlation energy $E_c$ from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+$E_c$ produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen lattice systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Resolving Abrikosov vortex entry in superconducting nano-string resonators via displacement-noise spectroscopy in cavity-optomechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05873v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors critically influence current flow and coherence, thereby imposing fundamental limits on superconducting quantum technologies. Quantum circuits employ superconducting elements at micro- and mesoscopic scales, where individual vortices can significantly impact device performance, necessitating investigation of vortex entry, motion, and pinning in these constrained geometries. Cavity-optomechanical platforms combining flux-tunable microwave resonators with superconducting nanomechanical elements offer a promising route to the single-photon strong-coupling regime and enable highly sensitive probing of the mechanical degree of freedom under elevated magnetic fields. Here, we exploit this platform to investigate vortex entry processes at the single-event level. We observe discrete jumps of the mechanical resonance frequency attributable to individual vortex entry, corresponding to attonewton-scale forces and allowing quantitative extraction of single-vortex pinning energies. These signatures are superimposed on a smooth power-law background characteristic of the collective Campbell-regime of vortex elasticity. Our results establish optomechanics-inspired sensing as a powerful method for exploring fundamental superconducting properties and identifying decoherence pathways in quantum circuits. Beyond advancing vortex physics, this work opens new opportunities for integrating mechanical sensing into superconducting device architectures, bridging condensed matter physics and quantum information science.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Interplay of ferroelectricity and interlayer superconductivity in van der Waals bilayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05871v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the distinctive features of the interplay between the interlayer superconductivity and ferroelectricity in van der Waals heterostructures. Corresponding analysis is carried out within the framework of the quasiclassical Eilenberger equations for a tunnel coupled bilayer with inhomogeneous relative shift of the conduction bands between the layers, which describes the net charge transfer in sliding ferroelectrics. It is shown that the critical temperature of the interlayer superconductivity can be significantly enhanced for superconducting nuclei localized in the vicinity of ferroelectric domain walls. We demonstrate that the increase in the tunneling amplitude leads to the decrease (increase) in the difference between the critical temperatures for localized and homogeneous superconducting states for the spin-singlet (spin-triplet) interlayer superconductivity. We also perform an extensive analysis of the effects of the in-plane magnetic field on the interlayer superconductivity. It is shown that the orbital effect can result in the suppression of the spin-singlet interlayer superconductivity and to the enhancement of the spin-triplet one. We find that possible manifestations of the paramagnetic effect include the suppression of the interlayer superconductivity by rather weak Zeeman fields, the two-fold anisotropy of the critical magnetic field for the spin-triplet states as well as the appearance of the reentrant superconducting phases. It is shown that the joint influence of the orbital and paramagnetic mechanisms on the spin-triplet interlayer superconductivity can even lead to a nonmonotonic behavior of the superconducting critical temperature as a function of the external magnetic field. The obtained results are discussed in the context of recent experimental data on van der Waals structures with coexisting superconductivity and sliding ferroelectricity.</p></details> | 34 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Lattice field theory for superconducting circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05851v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large superconducting quantum circuits have a number of important applications in quantum computing. Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schrödinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 2 appendices</p></details> |
| **[Cross-talk in superconducting qubit lattices with tunable couplers -- comparing transmon and fluxonium architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10298v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-talk between qubits is one of the main challenges for scaling superconducting quantum processors. Here, we use the density-matrix renormalization-group to numerically analyze lattices of superconducting qubits from a perspective of many-body localization. Specifically, we compare different architectures that include tunable couplers designed to decouple qubits in the idle state, and calculate the residual ZZ interactions as well as the inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states. For transmon qubits outside of the straddling regime, the results confirm that tunable C-shunt flux couplers are significantly more efficient in mitigating the ZZ interactions than tunable transmons. A recently proposed fluxonium architecture with tunable transmon couplers is demonstrated to also maintain its strong suppression of the ZZ interactions in larger systems, while having a higher inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states than lattices of transmon qubits. Our results thus suggest that fluxonium architectures may feature lower cross talk than transmon lattices when designed to achieve similar gate speeds and fidelities.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Excitation of quasiparticle pairs in superconducting nanodevices by 1/f noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05644v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting nanodevices such as qubits, resonators, and photodetectors, have revolutionized our capabilities for probing and controlling quantum phenomena. Nonequilibrium quasiparticles, which are broken Cooper pairs that cause decoherence and energy loss, can limit their performance. The number of these quasiparticles is often tens of orders of magnitude greater than would be present in thermal equilibrium. Background radiation has been shown to excite quasiparticles, but quasiparticles are observed even when the devices are carefully shielded. Here we show that the high-frequency components of 1/f noise can excite quasiparticle pairs and that this mechanism is consistent with previously unexplained experimental results. We also propose new experiments that exploit this quasiparticle excitation mechanism to non-invasively characterize high-frequency charge noise as well as the locations and nature of the defects producing the noise. The proposed experiments would also investigate how this noise changes as the defects that give rise to it evolve towards thermal equilibrium.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guest metal-driven quantum anharmonic effects on stability and two-gap superconductivity in carbon-boron clathrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05497v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, strong quantum anharmonic effects have been considered a characteristic of hydrogen-rich compounds. Here we propose that these effects also play a decisive role in boron-carbon clathrates. The stability and superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of carbon-boron clathrates XYB6C6, whose metal atoms have an average oxidation state of +1.5, have long remained under debate. At this oxidation state, some combinations (e.g., RbSrB6C6) are dynamically stable, whereas others (e.g., RbPbB6C6) are not. Using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation combined with machine learning, we find that the anharmonicity originates primarily from guest metal atoms. For comparison, we find that quantum fluctuations have negligible influence on SrB3C3, but remove the lattice instability of RbPbB6C6. The predicted Tc of RbPbB6C6 (88 K) is nearly twice that of SrB3C3. Moreover, RbPbB6C6 exhibits two-gap superconductivity due to the higher C/B ratio in the density of states at the Fermi level compared to SrB3C3, weakening the sp3 hybridization. These findings demonstrate that quantum anharmonicity crucially governs the stability and superconductivity of XYB6C6 clathrates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-field superconducting diode effect induced by magnetic flux in a van der Waals superconductor trigonal PtBi$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05427v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect is one of the nonreciprocal transport phenomena, where the critical current depends on the current direction. This effect is typically realized in superconductors with broken spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry. To break the time-reversal symmetry, external magnetic fields are commonly used. Here, we demonstrate a sign-controllable superconducting diode effect under zero external magnetic field in a van der Waals superconductor trigonal PtBi$_2$. The sign of the zero-field superconducting diode effect is controlled by the poling magnetic field, that is a large magnetic field applied prior to measurements. This result indicates that trapped magnetic flux are responsible for breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Our findings highlight the crucial role of trapped magnetic flux in generating the superconducting diode effect and provide a general pathway for realizing a zero-field superconducting diode effect.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Comparison of Nb and Ta Pentoxide Loss Tangents for Superconducting Quantum Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05407v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting transmon qubits are commonly made with thin-film Nb wiring, but recent studies have shown increased performance with Ta wiring. In this work, we compare the resonator-induced single photon, millikelvin dielectric loss for pentoxides of Nb (Nb2O5) and Ta (Ta2O5) in order to further understand limiting losses in qubits. Nb and Ta pentoxides of three thicknesses are deposited via pulsed laser deposition onto identical coplanar waveguide resonators. The two-level system (TLS) loss in Nb2O5 is determined to be about 30% higher than that of Ta2O5. This work indicates that qubits with Nb wiring are affected by higher loss arising from the native pentoxide itself, likely in addition to the presence of suboxides, which are largely absent in Ta.</p></details> |  |
| **[An evaluation of A15 Nb3Al superconducting thin films for application in quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05396v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A15 superconductors are distinguished by their high critical temperatures, magnetic fields, and current-carrying capabilities. Among them, Nb$_3$Al is of particular interest for superconducting quantum circuits as a means to extend device operating temperatures, provided that its electrodynamic properties are well understood. Here, we report on the synthesis of Nb$_3$Al thin films by magnetron co-sputtering followed by rapid thermal processing, yielding superconducting transition temperatures above 16~K. Microwire devices patterned from these films exhibit a coherence length of $3.2\,\mathrm{nm}$ and superfluid densities as low as $1.1\times 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, suggesting that Nb$_3$Al may enable high kinetic inductance in thinner films. Coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on Nb$_3$Al demonstrate single-photon internal quality factors up to $2.26\times 10^{5}$. These results establish Nb$_3$Al as a promising material platform for the development of superconducting quantum circuits operating at elevated temperatures, contingent on appropriate control of interfacial chemistry and surface morphology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity enhancement and doping-dependent phase diagram of Sm-based oxypnictides by high-pressure growth technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05177v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples are synthesized using an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) technique at 4 GPa and are characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. A systematic reduction of lattice parameters and unit-cell volume confirms effective fluorine substitution at oxygen sites, while Raman spectroscopy reveals electron doping and subtle changes in local bonding environments. In the underdoped regime, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude. The upper critical field (Hc2), estimated using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, reaches ~200 T, indicating strong spin paramagnetic effects and multiband superconductivity. Resistive broadening under applied fields follows Arrhenius behavior, with the activation energy showing a power-law field dependence that decreases rapidly at higher fields, consistent with collective vortex pinning. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A-cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. A direct comparison with CSP samples demonstrates that high-pressure synthesis simultaneously enhances both Tc and Jc across the entire fluorine-doping range. These findings establish high-pressure growth as a highly effective approach for optimizing iron-based superconductors and underscore its potential for both fundamental research and future high field applications.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Interplay between Superconductivity and Altermagnetism in Disordered Materials and Heterostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04819v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$π$ transitions.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Demonstration of surface-engineered oxidation-resistant Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding toward scalable superconducting quantum computing architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04712v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable quantum computing currently requires a large array of qubit integration, but present two-dimensional interconnects face challenges such as wiring congestion, electromagnetic interference, and limited cryogenic space. To overcome this challenge, implementing three-dimensional (3D) vertical architectures becomes crucial. Niobium (Nb), due to its excellent superconducting characteristics and strong fabrication process compatibility, stands out as a prime material choice. The main challenge in Nb-Nb bonding is the presence of an oxide layer at the interface, even after post-bonding annealing across various bonding methods. The native Nb oxide forms rapidly in air, creating a resistive barrier to supercurrent flow and introducing two-level system losses that degrade qubit coherence while increasing the overall thermal budget. These issues show the need for effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation during bonding. This study introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface. This approach enables low-temperature Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 °C under a reduced bonding pressure of 0.495 MPa. Detailed microstructural and interfacial analyses confirm that Au passivation effectively suppresses oxide formation and hence enhances bonding uniformity and strength with keeping the superconductivity, establishing a robust route toward low-temperature, low-pressure Nb-Nb bonding for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing architectures.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Superconductivity onset above 60 K in ambient-pressure nickelate films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04708v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelates has been capped at an onset transition temperature (Tc) of ~40 K, a value that remains lower than the cuprate (~133 K) and iron-based (~55 K) counterparts, despite the promise shown under high pressure. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at ~63 K in epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films grown under compressive strain on SrLaAlO4 substrates. This Tc leap is enabled by pushing our gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) method into an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. It leverages powerful in situ oxidation to simultaneously enhance kinetics via higher temperatures and achieve full oxygenation without post-annealing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm that this approach yields films of large-scale crystalline purity, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. These films exhibit a systematic evolution in their normal-state resistivity-temperature curve: the power-law exponent $α$ evolves from Fermi-liquid-like ($α$ ~2) at lower Tc to strange-metal-like ($α$ ~1) in higher Tc samples, directly linking the enhanced superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid behavior. Mapping the vortex melting phase diagram by the mutual inductance technique further reveals 2D melting limit suppressed to near zero, which demonstrates significantly stronger interlayer coupling than that of cuprates. These results identify the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system exhibiting strange-metal behavior, presenting an alternative framework to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm.</p></details> |  |

| **[Altermagnetism-induced non-collinear superconducting diode effect and unidirectional superconducting transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05543v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current studies of non-reciprocal superconducting (SC) transport have centered on the forward-backward asymmetry of the critical current measured along a single axis. In most realizations, this diode effect is achieved via introducing ferromagnetism or applying an external magnetic field, which drives system into an effective Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state but often at the cost of severely suppressing the SC gap and thus compromising device robustness. Here we propose and theoretically demonstrate that coupling a conventional $s$-wave SC thin film to a $d$-wave altermagnet offers a more resilient alternative. The momentum-dependent spin splitting inherent to altermagnets induces a non-collinear SC-diode effect in the BCS state, with the critical-current anisotropy exhibiting a fourfold ($C_4$) symmetry. Upon entering the FF state at large splitting, this anisotropy gradually evolves into a unidirectional ($C_1$) pattern. Crucially, the FF pairing momentum locks to the discrete crystal axes, eliminating the rotational Goldstone mode and preserving a sizable SC gap without any abrupt or significant suppression. These combined features make the altermagnetic proximity an appealing platform to engineer symmetry-protected, energy-efficient and programmable SC diodes for next-generation electronic devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ferroelectric Hysteresis in Superconducting Bilayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04251v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, coexisting ferroelectricity and superconductivity were reported in bilayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene. Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\textrm{r}}<P_{\textrm{c}}<P_{\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Comment on paper: Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry, Nature 614, 440 (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06054v5)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that an absolutely flat band retains the superconducting state at $T_c\to 0$. When $T_c>0$ the flat band disappears, since it must be modified by the superconducting state. Thus, a number of the results on ultra-strong coupling superconductivity in flat band considered in the article ("Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry", Nature 614, 440 (2023)) were predicted and explained many years ago. One has to take into account that at $T_c>0$ the flat band distorts, becoming tilted. As a result, the charge carriers' velocity $v_F\propto T_c$ becomes finite, rather than being extremely slow, as it is stated in the article. Thus, the statement "the charge carriers' group velocity $v_ F$ is extremely slow" is incorrect and leads the authors to the conceptional misunderstanding, confusing the reader.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 pag...</summary><p>1 page, Reference corrected.

| **[Super-hard and superconducting boron clathrates in the prediction of U-B compounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03842v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The binary metal borides provide a promising platform for searching unique materials with superconductivity and super-hardness under high pressure, owing to the distinctive bonding characters of boron. In this work, combined the first-principles calculations and crystal structure predictions, we predicted 4 exotic stoichiometries and 8 unique U-B compounds under high pressure. The predicted compounds have layered or caged structure units and 4 of them host high hardness under ambient pressure. By removal of the U atoms, we predicted three meta-stable boron clathrates at ambient pressure. Remarkably, the Vickers hardness of the predicted C2/m-B6 is estimated to be 49-53 GPa, and the C2/m-B12 is superconducting with the Tc value of 16.12 K. Our calculations enrich the phase diagram of binary metal borides and boron allotropes, providing insights for the future theoretical and experimental studies on unique materials.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Proximity-induced superconductivity in magnetic topological insulator films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03797v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inducing superconducting correlations in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) is emerging as a promising route toward the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. Here, we develop an analytical model for the proximity effect induced by an ordinary s-wave superconductor (SC) placed on top of a MTI thin film with finite thickness. Using a perturbative approach with respect to the electron tunneling between MTI and SC, we derive the leading-order correction to the anomalous Green's function and evaluate the position-dependent induced pairing as a function of all the system parameters. This framework allows us to resolve the spatial, spin, and momentum structure of the induced superconducting order parameter. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the decay length of the pairing amplitude at the $k_x=k_y=0$ point, and show that increasing magnetization enhances the spin-polarized triplet components and the p-wave contributions of the anomalous Green's function. These findings highlight the interplay between topology, magnetism, and superconductivity in MTI films, providing analytical insight into the emergence of unconventional pairing symmetries relevant for the realization of Majorana modes in finite geometries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Poly- and single-crystalline diamond nitrogen-induced TLS losses estimation with superconducting lumped elements micro-resonators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03780v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on diamond has intensified due to its exceptional thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, making it a key material in quantum technologies and high-power applications. Diamonds with engineered nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers represent a very sensitive platform for quantum sensing, while high-optical quality diamond windows represent a fundamental safety component inside Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) systems in nuclear fusion reactors. A major challenge is the development of ultra-low-loss, high-optical-quality single-crystal diamond substrates to meet growing demands for quantum coherence and power handling. Traditionally, dielectric losses ($\tan δ$) in diamonds are evaluated using Fabry-Perot microwave resonators, in which the resonance quality factors Q of the cavity with and without the sample are compared. These devices are limited to resolutions around 10$^{-5}$ by the need to keep the resonator dimensions within a reasonable range. In contrast, superconducting thin-film micro-strip resonators, with Q factors exceeding 10$^6$, are stated to provide higher sensitivity for assessing ultra-low-loss materials. This study examines four diamond samples grown through different processes, analyzing their dielectric losses at extreme low temperatures (sub-Kelvin) within the Two-Level System (TLS) framework. Complementary Raman spectroscopy measurements allowed us not only to associate higher nitrogen content with increased losses, but also to investigate how the different growth process influence the way these defects are incorporated in the crystal lattice.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

This leads us to prove a general result: local electron correlations in Hubbard-type models are fully classical since the local reduced density matrix is separable in the natural basis and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. These results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and nonlocal entanglement, and they provide a clear path for the study of the relationship between traditional quantum resources and the nonfreeness, in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added an explicit generalization to multiorbital/multicomponent systems + some new references + data availability statement. | 5 pages + references + end matter | 3 figures</p></details> |

The influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on the persistent current is systematically analyzed. To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures (comments are welcome)</p></details> |
| **[Polylogarithmic-Depth Quantum Algorithm for Simulating the Extended Hubbard Model on a Two-Dimensional Lattice Using the Fast Multipole Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03898v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</p></details> |  |

The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + references, 8 figures.

As in the Hartree-Fock approximation there are a vast number of local minima, nearly degenerate in energy. What is new, and unlike the conventional Hartree-Fock states, is that there is a region in parameter space where these local minima are clearly associated with d-wave condensates of the form $d_{x^2-y^2}$ in the underdoped region. There are, however, indications of $d_{xy}$ condensation in the overdoped region, at least in this approximation to the 2D Hubbard model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures. v2: This second version is an extensive revision of version 1, containing corrections, additional data, and a new title</p></details> |

With this result in tow, we rely on the proof of Watanabe's that two models which differ by a twist must have the same bulk physics. Consequently, we have proven that MMHK=Hubbard in the charge sector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reaching Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev physics by shaking the Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02755v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Simulation of the 2D Hubbard Model via Hilbert Space-Filling Curve Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02666v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate tensor network simulations of the two-dimensional Hubbard model by mapping the lattice onto a one-dimensional chain using space-filling curves. In particular, we focus on the Hilbert curve, whose locality-preserving structure minimizes the range of effective interactions in the mapped model. This enables a more compact matrix product state (MPS) representation compared to conventional snake mapping. Through systematic benchmarks, we show that the Hilbert curve consistently yields lower ground-state energies at fixed bond dimension, with the advantage increasing for larger system sizes and in physically relevant interaction regimes. Our implementation reaches clusters up to $32\times32$ sites with open and periodic boundary conditions, delivering reliable ground-state energies and correlation functions in agreement with established results, but at significantly reduced computational cost. These findings establish space-filling curve mappings, particularly the Hilbert curve, as a powerful tool for extending tensor-network studies of strongly correlated two-dimensional quantum systems beyond the limits accessible with standard approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Power-Law Spectra and Asymptotic $ω/T$ Scaling in the Orbital-Selective Mott Phase of a Three-Orbital Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23758v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum materials whose properties lie beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi-liquid paradigm have been observed for decades across diverse material platforms. Finding microscopic lattice models for metallic states that exhibit such peculiar behavior remains a major theoretical challenge, as these features often originate from strong quantum fluctuations in strongly interacting electron systems. Here we investigate a three-orbital Hubbard model at a high-symmetry point that hosts a transition from a metallic to an orbital-selective Mott (OSM) phase. Employing single-site dynamical mean-field theory combined with full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group, we chart the $T-U$ phase diagram and obtain high-resolution real-frequency dynamics. In the OSM regime we find asymptotically scale-invariant (power-law) single-particle spectra and asymptotic $ω/T$ scaling in both charge and spin channels, spanning several decades in frequency and temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism accompanied by flavor-selective Mott states in an SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01264v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the ferromagnetic instability in an SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model on the hypercubic lattice. Combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that, in the strong-coupling regime at low temperatures, ferromagnetically ordered (FM) states develop away from the commensurate fillings. In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies. The results uncover the nature of the FM state in the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems and highlight the rich magnetic behavior enabled by enlarged internal symmetries.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Dynamics of superconducting pairs in the two-dimensional Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01124v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The frequency structure of the superconducting correlations in cuprates gives insights on the pairing mechanism. Here we present an exhaustive study of this problem in the two-dimensional Hubbard model with cellular dynamical mean-field theory. To this end, we systematically quantify the dependence on doping and interaction strength of the superconducting gap, of the frequency scales where pairing occurs, and of their relative contribution to pairing. We find pair-forming alternating with pair-breaking processes as a function of frequency, providing new evidence that pairing can arise in principle from both low- and high-frequency processes. However, we find that the high-frequency pair-forming processes are outweighed by pair-breaking ones. Hence, the net contribution to pairing comes only from the low-frequency pair-forming processes, a result that underscores their key role in the pairing mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, and supplemental material</p></details> |
| **[Exchange interaction in gate-defined quantum dots beyond the Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23277v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A quantitative description of the exchange interaction in quantum dots is relevant for modeling gate operations of spin qubits. By measuring the amplitude and frequency of exchange-driven qubit state oscillations, we measure the detuning dependence of the exchange coupling in a GaAs double quantum dot over three orders of magnitude. Both 1D and 3D full configuration interaction simulations can replicate the observed behavior. Extending a Hubbard model by including excited states increases the range of detuning where it provides a good fit, thus elucidating the underlying physics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Numerical validation of an ultracold Hubbard quantum simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18041v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply the formally exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method to probe the unprecedentedly low-temperature regime recently achieved in an ultracold-atom quantum simulation of the 2D Hubbard model [Xu et al., Nature 642, 909 (2025)]. Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Antiferromagnetism and Kekulé valence bond order in the honeycomb optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21440v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise role of e-ph coupling in graphene and related materials on a honeycomb lattice is not yet fully understood, despite extensive research on these systems. Here, we perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (oSSH)-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, focusing on the parameters relevant to graphene. Performing finite-size scaling analyzes, we obtain the model's ground state phase diagram, which includes the semi-metal (SM), Kekulé Valence Bond Solid (KVBS), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phases, as well as indications of a small KVBS/AFM coexistence region. We find that a weak to moderate Hubbard repulsion, tuned toward the SM-AFM critical value in the pure honeycomb Hubbard model, enhances KVBS correlations and can even stabilize the KVBS phase. Estimating the effective parameters for graphene places it in the SM region of the phase diagram, but near the SM-KVBS phase boundary. Notably, we predict that increasing either the on-site Hubbard repulsion or the e-ph coupling strength drives graphene toward the KVBS phase rather than the AFM phase, highlighting a synergistic effect that can be exploited to further control the remarkable properties of graphene and related materials.</p></details> | contain 4 figures |
| **[Spin-triplet pairing instability in a two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09295v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model, from an unbiased numerical perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competition between charge-density-wave and superconducting orders on eight-leg square Hubbard cylinders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18644v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The issue of whether $d$-wave superconductivity (SC) occurs in the square-lattice Hubbard model with $U$ of order of the bandwidth has been one of the most debated issues to emerge from the study of high temperature SC. Here, we report variational results on eight-leg cylinders with next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the range $-0.5 t \leq t'\leq 0.25 t$ with $U = 8t$ and $12t$ and doped hole concentrations $δ=1/12$ and $1/8$. For $t'\leq 0$, the ground-state appears to be a charge-density wave (CDW) of one sort or another with SC correlations that are extremely short-ranged. In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'>0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit. These results were obtained employing matrix-product states with bond dimensions large enough that energy differences as small as $10^{-3}t$ per site can be resolved.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures plus Supplemental Material.

| **[Probing Boundary Spins in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17173v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying boundary excitations provides a powerful approach to probe correlations in topological phases. We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains. We also discuss how the correlated phase of the isolated chain is characterized by boundary zeros in its single-particle Green's function, and briefly comment on their localization properties in relation to the boundary spins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Pair scattering from time-modulated impurity in the Bose-Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17032v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate scattering phenomena in a one-dimensional attractive Bose-Hubbard model with a time-periodically modulated impurity. We analyze both single-particle and pair (doublon) transmission, exploring a range of interaction strengths and drive amplitudes. Our exact numerical results reveal excellent quantitative agreement with analytical predictions in the high-frequency limit. At intermediate and weak attractive interactions, we observe significant pair dissociation and the emergence of dynamically localized single-particle modes. These features are reminiscent of Floquet Bound States in the Continuum (BICs). These findings provide new avenues for engineering controllable quantum transport and localized states in ultracold atom experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Charge-Ordered States and the Phase Diagram of the Extended Hubbard Model on the Bethe lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16603v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the extended Hubbard model (EHM) with both onsite Hubbard interaction and the intersite density-density interaction between nearest-neighbors using the standard Hartree mean-field approximation (MFA) on the Bethe lattice. We found that, at the ground state, the system can be in a charge-ordered insulating (COI), a charge-order metallic (COM) or a non-charge-ordered (NO) state. Moreover, the finite-temperature phase diagrams are presented. Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed. The results show that increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and change the properties of the system from insulating to metallic. Worth noting, that a number of phenomena can be found within the MFA, where their analysis is much simpler than in more advanced approaches. The method used for the EHM on the Bethe lattice also allows for a series of analytical derivations and simplification to see general geometry-independent features and analytical results, avoiding the numerical inaccuracies and other issues that appear with a purely numerical solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 65 references; RevTeX class, double-column formatting</p></details> |
| **[Eigenstate solutions of the Fermi-Hubbard model via symmetry-enhanced variational quantum eigensolver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15903v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is an important tool for effective quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables, accepted by Communications in Theoretical Physics</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures + supplemental</p></details> |
| **[Consistent gauge theories for the slave particle representation of the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09264v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to clarify the confusion and inconsistency in our recent works [1,2], and to address the incompleteness therein. In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04756v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Competing $s$-wave pairing in overdoped $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22473v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The $d$-wave pairing symmetry has long been considered a defining feature of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($δ\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Low-energy photoexcitation inside the Mott gap in doped Hubbard and t-J ladders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21813v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate changes in the optical conductivity of doped Mott insulators by tuning ultrashort pump pulses to target either the Drude or low-energy absorption regions. Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10430v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $δ= 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $δ= 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Through state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations using the grand canonical ensemble, we address open issues regarding the ground-state phase diagram of the extended $t\text{-}J$ model on a square lattice in the parameter regime relevant to cuprate superconductors. On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure $t\text{-}J$ model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of doping ($δ=0.1-0.2$), hosts robust d-wave superconductivity possibly coexisting with weak unidirectional pair density wave. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping $t_2$ suppresses pair and charge density waves, resulting in a uniform d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems. Our work validates the $t\text-J$ model as a proper minimum model for the emergence of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.</p></details> |  |

While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying the structure of La3Ni2O7 in the pressurized superconducting state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15265v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise crystal structure of La3Ni2O7 in its high-pressure superconducting state has been a subject of intense debate, with proposed models including both orthorhombic and tetragonal symmetries. Using high-pressure Raman spectroscopy combined with frst-principles calculations, we unravel the structural evolution of La3Ni2O7 under pressure up to 32.7 GPa. We identify a clear structural transition sequence: from the orthorhombic Amam phase to a mixed Amam+Fmmm phase at 4 GPa, followed by a complete transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at 14.5 GPa, which is signaled by a pronounced phonon renormalization. The emergence of bulk superconductivity is found to coincide precisely with this transition to the I4/mmm phase. Our results de nitively establish the tetragonal I4/mmm structure as the host of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, resolving a central controversy and providing a critical foundation for understanding the superconducting mechanism in nickelates.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures with supplemental materials</p></details> |

Here, we address this by synthesizing high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$) with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice, particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$ rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm 2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the $c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/Å, demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Here we propose to broadly expand the choices of materials platforms to achieve high-Tc superconducting La3Ni2O7 films by proposing designer substrates of Ba1-xSrxO (x = 0 - 1) that allow to continuously tune the strain in the films from being tensile to compressive. Our systematic study of the structural and electronic reconstructions of the strained La3Ni2O7 bilayer film leads to the central finding that at the optimal tensile strain of ~2% (x ~0.25), the spectral weight of the Ni dz2 orbital is peaked right at the Fermi level, and its hybridization with the Ni dx2-y2 orbital is substantially enhanced. Consequently, the expected Tc should be unprecedentedly high, at least substantially higher than those achieved in the compressive regime. Furthermore, our detailed thickness-dependent energetic analyses show that such films can be stably grown for thicknesses equal to or beyond the bilayer regime, and predict that the SrO-terminated SrTiO3 should also be able to stabilize the films with optimal tensile strain and higher Tc's.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the superconducting gap amplitude and symmetry, the key parameters to characterize a superconductor, remain elusive due to the overwhelming challenges of gap studies under high pressure. Here, we introduce in situ directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation, differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors.

Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_2$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have reported superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-delta under pressure, with zero-resistance near 80 K, though the Meissner effect remains debated due to low superconducting volume fractions and limited high-pressure magnetic measurement techniques. In this work, we use diamond quantum sensors and four-probe detection to observe both zero resistance and the Meissner effect in the same La3Ni2O7-delta single crystal. By mapping the Meissner effect, we visualized superconducting regions and revealed sample inhomogeneities. Our combined magnetic and electrical measurements on the same crystal provide dual evidence of superconductivity, supporting the high-temperature superconductivity of La3Ni2O7-delta.

Our numerical calculations indicate that interlayer pairing is dominant, resulting in an $s_\pm$-wave symmetry. We propose employing perpendicular electric fields, a practical method in thin film systems, to verify the pairing symmetry. Our calculations predict that such fields will induce Fermi arcs or nodal points and significantly modulate the gap near the diagonal, with the modulated region overlapping the area probed by ARPES. This approach provides an effective tool for probing pairing symmetry in bilayer nickelate thin films, especially given current limitations in experimental techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, including the supplemental material</p></details> |

Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule. These results suggest that the normal state of La3Ni2O7 to be a multiband metallic nature.</p></details> |  |

Using density functional theory calculations, we elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ by comprehensively analyzing structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics. Consistent with recent scanning transmission electron microscopy observations, we find an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at $-0.9\%$ strain, preceding superconductivity onset. Electronic analysis shows compressive strain lowers Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital energy levels, while interfacial Sr diffusion effectively reconstructs the $d_{z^2}$ pockets, quantitatively matching angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. The interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\perp$ under pressure or strain closely tracks experimental superconducting $T_c$ variation. The dome-shaped pressure dependence and monotonic strain dependence of $J_\perp$ mainly arise from modulations in the apical oxygen $p_z$ energy levels. Moreover, compressive strain suppresses both charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities analogous to pressure effects, with SDW vanishing concurrently with the structural transition and CDW disappearing at $\sim-3.3\%$ strain. Our results indicate that suppressed density waves and enhanced $J_\perp$ are crucial for both strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity. Accordingly, we propose several candidate substrates capable of achieving greater compressive strain, thereby potentially increasing $T_c$.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

In this respect, Sr-Ni-O RP-type phases represent alternative systems that exist with partial cation substitution. We demonstrate that by Y-doping in Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (SNAO), as Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (YSNAO), the drawback of an insulating ground state is overcome, and a significant decrease in resistivity is achieved with crystals exhibiting semiconducting behavior. We employ optical floating zone (OFZ) growth at 10 bar oxygen partial pressure to explore the phase formation in a narrow region of Y-Sr-Ni-Al-O and investigate via DFT the general stability of the pure Sr-Ni-O scenario. Using extensive diffraction and spectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the structural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and reduced compounds were investigated. The optimal growth of YSNAO allows for large high quality crystals suitable for neutron studies. In the Al-free growth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-δ}$, from which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed, opening the door for future exploration of \textit{A}-site substituted RP-type phases without Ni-site disorder.</p></details> |  |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |

In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity. Our findings indicate that interlayer Coulomb interactions are crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.</p></details> |  |

However, while zero resistance state has been observed, experimental characterization of the superconducting properties of pressurized nickelates is still limited and experimentally challenging. Here, we present the first full temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 measurement in La4Ni3O10 single crystal, achieved by combining high magnetic field and high-pressure techniques. Remarkably, the Hc2 of La4Ni3O10 is nearly isotropic, with the anisotropic parameter monotonically increasing from 1.4 near Tc to 1 at lower temperatures. By analyzing the Hc2 using the two-band model, we uncover that the anisotropic diffusivity of the bands, primarily originating from d(z2 ) and d(x2-y2 ) orbitals, is well compensated, resulting in an unusually isotropic superconducting state. These findings provide critical experimental evidence that underscores the significant role of the d(z2 ) orbital in enabling superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

It is believed that the density wave (DW) at ~150 K plays an important role in SC emergence, but its nature remains largely underexplored. Here, we utilized temperature-dependent in-situ Ni K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to probe the Ni-3d/4p electronic states of La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta samples down to 4.8 K, enabling us to witness the evolution of both in-plane d_(x^2-y^2)/p_x (p_y) and out-of-plane d_(3z^2-r^2)/p_z orbitals of NiO6 octahedron across the DW transition. Main edge energy associated with Ni 4p orbital shows an anomalous decline near DW transition, signifying the occurrence of lattice distortions as a hallmark of charge density wave. Below DW transition, the enlarged crystal field splitting (CFS) indicates an enhanced NiO6 octahedral distortion. Intriguingly, magnetic Pr substituents could activate the mutual interplay of d_(x^2-y^2) and d_(3z^2-r^2) orbitals. We discussed its relevance to the favored bulk SC in the pressurized polycrystalline La2PrNi2O7-delta than pristine.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Despite intense research, determination of the exact oxygen content and understanding of the relationship between superconductivity and oxygen content remain a big challenge. Here, we report a systematical study on the structure and physical properties of La3Ni2O7-d polycrystalline powders which were prepared using sol-gel method at ambient pressure and then annealed under various oxygen pressure. We found that high pO2 annealing with slow cooling results in a new phase, which can be modeled using the hybrid single-layer-trilayer La3Ni2O7 or the tetragonal bilayer La3Ni2O7. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed significant single layers and trilayers after high oxygen pressure annealing, evidencing damage of the bilayer structure. The superconducting transition under high pressure became weak for high pO2 annealed samples, which is consistent with the damage of the bilayer structure. Our results reveal that the bilayer structure is fragile and post-annealing under near atmosphere pressure of oxygen is suitable to maintain bilayer structure and increase oxygen content at the same time.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15322v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $χ^b > χ^a > χ^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $χ^a > χ^c > χ^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Yin-Yang vortex on UTe2 (011) surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21506v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UTe2 is a promising candidate for spin-triplet superconductor, yet its exact superconducting order parameter remains highly debated. Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Electronic dimensionality of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15435v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in the heavy-fermion metal UTe2 survives the application of very high magnetic fields, presenting both an intriguing puzzle and an experimental challenge. The strong, non-perturbative influence of the magnetic field complicates the determination of superconducting order parameters in the high-field phases. Here, we report electronic transport anisotropy measurements in precisely aligned microbars in magnetic fields to 45 T applied along the b-axis. Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter. A pair-density-wave-like state at high fields could naturally induce a layered modulation of the superfluid density, forming planar structures that confine vortices and guide their sliding in the flux-flow regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surface charge density wave in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12505v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pair Wavefunction Symmetry in UTe2 from Zero-Energy Surface State Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16636v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although nodal spin-triplet topological superconductivity appears probable in UTe2, its superconductive order-parameter $Δ_k$ remains unestablished. In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band (TSB), which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor, and also distinguish a chiral from non-chiral $Δ_k$ via enhanced s-wave proximity. Here we employ s-wave superconductive scan-tips and detect intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging reveals sub-gap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a-axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity, signifies that $Δ_k$ of UTe2 is a non-chiral state: B1u, B2u or B3u. However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a-axis is internodal, then a non-chiral B3u state is the most consistent for UTe2.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 figures, to appear in Science (2025)</p></details> |

In Kondo lattice systems, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon Knight shift have proven to be particularly sensitive to the properties of the developing heavy-electron fluid. Here we report muon Knight shift measurements on high-quality UTe2 single crystals grown by a molten salt-flux method. Together with previous data from a single crystal grown by a chemical-vapor transport method, our results show the contribution of the heavy-electron liquid to the muon Knight shift increases below a crossover temperature T* ~ 30 K in accord with a universal scaling function of T/T* for heavy-fermion materials. An observed departure from this universal scaling below a temperature T ~ 12 K at certain muon stopping sites signifies a reversal of the Kondo hybridization and a relocalization of U 5f moments with an antiferromagnetic coupling. The preservation of universal scaling at a different muon site demonstrates a coexistence of itinerant and localized 5f electron states preceding the superconducting phase transition.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[High Field Superconducting Phases of Ultra Clean Single Crystal UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21689v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the magnetoresistance of high-quality single crystals of UTe2 with Tc=2.1K in high magnetic fields up to 36T, with the field direction between the b and c-axes. From the angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2, we found that the field-reentrant superconducting phase near H // b-axis extends up to a field angle (24 deg) from the b to c-axis, where another field-reentrant superconducting phase begins to appear above the metamagnetic transition field, Hm. Our results suggest that the field-reentrant superconductivity below Hm near the b-axis is closely related to the superconductivity above Hm when the field is tilted toward the c-axis. Superconductivity appears to be robust when the field direction is maintained perpendicular to the magnetization easy axis, implying that fluctuations boosting superconductivity may persist. At first glance, these findings resemble the field-reentrant (reinforced) superconductivity observed in ferromagnetic superconductors URhGe and UCoGe, where Ising-type ferromagnetic fluctuations play a crucial role. However, in UTe2, the fluctuations are more complex. The angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 contrasts with that of the initial slope of Hc2 near Tc, revealing the anisotropic field response of fluctuations. Thanks to the high-quality samples, quantum oscillations were detected for field directions close to the c-axis using magnetoresistance (Shubnikov-de Haas effect) and torque (de Haas-van Alphen effect) measurements. The angular dependence of frequencies is in good agreement with those observed previously using the field-modulation technique, confirming quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in J.

Though UTe2 is considered to be a heavy fermion material, only light-electron Fermi surfaces have been compellingly identified, while a possible heavy electron Fermi surface near the momentum space Z-point has been the subject of more speculative and incongruent interpretations based on density functional theory (DFT+U) and experimental measurements. Here we explore the DFT+U band structure within a tight binding model framework to identify emergence mechanisms for heavy fermion Fermi surfaces. Applying a Gutzweiller-like renormalization term to f-electron kinetics is found to distort the lowest energy f electron band from a saddle point to a local minimum at the Z-point, introducing a shallow Fermi pocket and greatly improving compatibility with recent experiments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Absence of a Bulk Thermodynamic Phase Transition to a Density Wave Phase in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14714v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competing and intertwined orders are ubiquitous in strongly correlated electron systems, such as the charge, spin, and superconducting orders in the high-Tc cuprates. Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements provide evidence for a charge density wave (CDW) that coexists with superconductivity in the heavy Fermion metal UTe2. This CDW persists up to at least 7.5 K and, as a CDW breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice, its disappearance is necessarily accompanied by thermodynamic phase transition. Here, we report high-precision thermodynamic measurements of the elastic moduli of UTe2. We observe no signature of a phase transition in the elastic moduli down to a level of 1 part in 10^7, strongly implying the absence of bulk CDW order in UTe2. We suggest that the CDW and associated pair density wave (PDW) observed by STM may be confined to the surface of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molten Salt Flux Liquid Transport Method for Ultra Clean Single Crystals UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12740v2)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various single crystal growth techniques are presented for the unconventional superconductor UTe2. The molten salt flux liquid transport (MSFLT) method is employed to grow high-quality and large single crystals, exhibiting a high residual resistivity ratio (RRR = 200-800). On the other hand, the Te self-flux and chemical vapor transport (CVT) method produces samples of lower quality. The MSFLT method is a hybrid approach that combines the molten salt flux (MSF) and CVT methods. One significant advantage is that the materials gradually crystallize at the relatively low temperature which is fixed during the main process. This might be crucial for preventing U deficiency and obtaining high-quality and large single crystals of UTe2. Many different single crystals obtained by different technique were characterized by resistivity, specific heat measurements. The superconducting transition temperature decreases with the residual resistivity, followed by the Abrikosov-Gor'kov pair breaking theory. The highest quality sample reaches Tc=2.1K. The residual gamma-value of specific heat for the highest quality sample is only 3 percents of the normal state gamma-value. The specific heat jump, Delta C/(gamma Tc) reaches about 2.7 for high quality samples, indicating a strong coupling superconductor. Furthermore, the magnetic susceptibility for the field along a-axis in a high quality single crystal does not show an up-turn behavior on cooling, which is consistent with the results of NMR Knight shift and muSR experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in J.

Braithwaite et al., Commun. Phys. 2, 147 (2019)]. The clarification of pairing mechanisms and symmetries of gap functions are essentially important for understanding the multiple-phase diagram. Since the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations with Ising-like anisotropy is suggested from measurements of magnetic susceptibilities and neutron scattering measurements, it is expected that the interplay between these spin fluctuations plays a crucial role in the emergence of the multiple superconducting phases. Motivated by these observations, we examine the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing mechanism, analyzing the linearized Eliashberg equations for an effective model of f-electron bands. It is found that the Ising-like ferromagnetic fluctuations stabilize spin-triplet pairings in either the Au or B3u states, whereas Ising-like antiferromagnetic fluctuations stabilize spin-triplet pairings in the B1u state. These results provide a plausible scenario elucidating the multiple superconducting phases under pressure.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

We observe atomic-like low-energy excitations that support the correlated nature of this unconventional superconductor. These excitations originate from the U $5f^2$ configuration, which is unexpected since the short Te2-Te2 distances exclude Te2 being 2-. By utilizing the photoionization cross-section dependence of the photoemission spectra in combination with band structure calculations, we infer that the stabilization of the U $5f^2$ configuration is due to the U $6d$ bonding states in the U-dimers acting as a charge reservoir. Our results emphasize that the description of the physical properties should commence with a $5f^2$ $ansatz$.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, article</p></details> |

In contrast to previous muSR studies of UTe2 single crystals grown by a chemical vapour transport (CVT) method, we find no evidence of magnetic clusters or electronic moments fluctuating slow enough to cause a discernible relaxation of the zero-field muSR asymmetry spectrum. Consequently, our measurements on MSF-grown single crystals rule out the generation of spontaneous magnetic fields in the bulk that would occur near impurities or lattice defects if the superconducting state of UTe2 breaks time-reversal symmetry. This result suggests UTe2 is characterized by a single-component superconducting order parameter.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

This heavy-fermion paramagnet was rapidly identified as a reference compound to study the interplay between magnetism and unconventional superconductivity with multiple degrees of freedom. The proximity to a ferromagnetic quantum phase transition was initially proposed as a driving force to triplet-pairing superconductivity. However, we find here that long-range incommensurate antiferromagnetic order is established under pressure. The propagation vector km = (0.07,0.33,1) of the antiferromagnetic phase is close to a wavevector where antiferromagnetic fluctuations have previously been observed at ambient pressure. These elements support that UTe2 is a nearly-antiferromagnet at ambient pressure.

In this work we use scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize the role of topological defects in the novel magnetic field induced disappearance of an intertwined charge density wave (CDW) in the heavy fermion superconductor, UTe2. By simultaneously imaging the amplitude and phase of the CDW order, we reveal pairs of topological defects with positive and negative phase winding. The pairs are directly correlated with a zero CDW amplitude and increase in number with increasing magnetic field. These observations can be captured by a Ginzburg Landau model of a uniform superconductor coexisting with a pair density wave. A magnetic field generates vortices of the superconducting and pair density wave order which can create topological defects in the CDW and induce the experimentally observed melting of the CDW at the upper critical field. Our work reveals the important role of magnetic field generated topological defects in the melting the CDW order parameter in UTe2 and provides support for the existence of a parent pair density wave order on the surface of UTe2.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 Pa...</summary><p>29 Pages, includes manuscript and supplemental information, 4 Main figures and 8 Supplemental Figures</p></details> |
| **[Anisotropic field-induced changes in the superconducting order parameter of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04938v1)** | 2023-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UTe2 is a newly discovered unconventional superconductor, where electron Cooper pairs combine into a spin-triplet ground state. Here we report the specific heat C(H,T) of a high-quality single crystal of UTe2 with a single specific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition temperature T_c {\approx} 2 K and a small zero-field residual Sommerfeld coefficient γ_0 = C/T (T=0) = 10 mJ/mol-K^2. We applied magnetic field up to 12 T along the three principal crystallographic axes of UTe2 to probe the nature of the superconducting state. The evolution of the residual Sommerfeld coefficient as a function of magnetic field, γ_0 (H), is highly anisotropic and reveals distinct regions. In magnetic field up to 4 T applied along a, b, and c axes, we find γ_0{\approx}α_i {\square}H, with i=a,b,c, as expected for an unconventional superconductor with nodes (zeros) of the superconducting order parameter on the Fermi surface. A pronounced kink in γ_0(H), however, is observed at roughly 4 T for field applied along both a and b axes, whereas a smooth change from square-root to linear behaviour is observed at 4 T for H//c. These results strongly indicate that a zero-field ground state is stable up to 4 T and undergoes a field-induced evolution above 4 T. {α_c} > {α_a} > {α_b}, indicating that the nodes in the low-field state are predominantly located in the vicinity of the a-b plane. The modification of the order parameter is strongest when field is applied in the a-b plane, which causes nodes to move away from the direction of the applied field. Both d_(B_2u)+id_(B_1u) and d_(B_2u)+id_(A_u) two-component order parameters can account for our observations, with d_(B_2u)+id_(B_1u) a more likely candidate. In either scenario, our measurements indicate that B_2u is the primary superconducting order parameter in UTe2.</p></details> |  |

The pairing symmetry of recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor UTe2 featuring an exceedingly large upper critical field has attracted a great deal of attention. Even though it is widely believed that UTe2 possesses an odd-parity, spin-triplet pairing symmetry, direct evidence for it is lacking, especially at zero or low magnetic fields. We report here the selection-rule results of Josephson coupling between In, an s-wave superconductor, and UTe2. The orientation dependence of the Josephson coupling suggests very strongly that UTe2 possess an odd-parity pairing state of B_1u in zero magnetic fields. We also report the formation of Andreev surface bound states on the (1-10) surface of UTe2.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03434v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Highly precise predictions can be made using standard techniques, both in the continuum and in the lattice frameworks. However, classical methods have limitations, particularly when attempting to extrapolate the continuum limit from the study of lattice gauge theories. Complementing classical computations or combining them with quantum computational methods, to improve the predictions towards the continuum limit with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages + 17 pages appendix/references, 9 figures; updated version after acceptance</p></details> |

As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis defended on 27th November 2025 at the University of Valencia; 185 pages of work; 205 pages including preliminaries and covers</p></details> |
| **[Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01263v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

High-speed, low-power data transmission is pivotal to enabling the deployment of larger-scale cryogenic systems, including the scalable quantum computing systems and the high-performance cryogenic computing systems fully immersed in liquid nitrogen. In contrast to wireline and microwave links, optical communication links are emerging as a solution characterized by high data rates, high energy efficiency, low signal attenuation, absence of thermal conduction, and superior scalability. In this work, a 4K heat-insulated high-speed (56Gbps) low-power (1.6pJ/b) transceiver (TRX) that achieves a complete link between 4K systems and room temperature (RT) equipment is presented. Copackaged with a PIN photodiode (PD), the RX uses an inverter-based analog front-end and an analog half-rate clock data recovery loop. Connecting to a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), the TX contains a voltage-mode driver with current-mode injection for low-power output-swing-boosting and 3-tap feed-forward equalization (FFE). This link has been demonstrated in the control and readout of a complete superconducting quantum computing system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of interacting bosons in a two-leg ring ladder with artificial magnetic flux and ac-driven modulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21445v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting bosons in a two-leg ring ladder pierced by an artificial magnetic flux, where the particles are initially localized in the central sites of both rings, and the ac-driven local energy shifts are applied to the remaining lattice sites. Within the mean-field approximation, we demonstrate the emergence of nonlinear self-trapping for strong interparticle interactions, and characterize the distinct excitation regimes in the absence of the inter-ring tunneling. The artificial magnetic flux typically introduces Peierls phase factors, which induces complex-valued hopping amplitudes and leads to directed net particle currents along the chains. By further incorporating the finite inter-ring coupling and biased intra-ring hopping, we reveal that the tuning of the drive frequency and Peierls phase allows the precise control over both the intensity and direction of particle currents, which facilitates the transition between chiral and antichiral dynamics. These findings offer insights into the coherent manipulation of matter-wave transports in closed-loop lattice configurations and the exploration of nonequilibrium synthetic quantum systems in related fields.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+10 ...</summary><p>8+10 pages, 4+7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Artificial Intelligence Driven Workflow for Accelerating Design of Novel Photosensitizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19347v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-performance photosensitizers has long been hindered by the time-consuming and resource-intensive nature of traditional trial-and-error approaches. Here, we present \textbf{A}I-\textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{P}hoto\textbf{S}ensitizer \textbf{I}nnovation (AAPSI), a closed-loop workflow that integrates expert knowledge, scaffold-based molecule generation, and Bayesian optimization to accelerate the design of novel photosensitizers. The scaffold-driven generation in AAPSI ensures structural novelty and synthetic feasibility, while the iterative AI-experiment loop accelerates the discovery of novel photosensitizers. AAPSI leverages a curated database of 102,534 photosensitizer-solvent pairs and generate 6,148 synthetically accessible candidates. These candidates are screened via graph transformers trained to predict singlet oxygen quantum yield ($φ_Δ$) and absorption maxima ($λ_{max}$), following experimental validation. This work generates several novel candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), among which the hypocrellin-based candidate HB4Ph exhibits exceptional performance at the Pareto frontier of high quantum yield of singlet oxygen and long absorption maxima among current photosensitizers ($φ_Δ$=0.85, $λ_{max}$=650nm).</p></details> |  |
| **[Giant Nonlinear Photon-Drag Currents in Centrosymmetric Moiré Bilayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16987v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified microscopic theory of nonlinear photon-drag currents, formulated within a geometric-loop framework that provides both transparent quantum-geometric interpretation and numerical tractability. In this picture, the photon-drag shift current corresponds to the dipole moment of the geometric loop, while the photon-drag injection current arises from the same loop weighted by a band velocity difference. We apply the theory to an exact continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ab initio accuracy. Remarkably, an in-plane wavevector only a few times larger than that of free-space photons already produces sizable photon-drag currents in centrosymmetric TBG, comparable to photogalvanic responses in typical noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional materials. These currents are broadly tunable by twist angle, photon wavevector, and light polarization. Our results establish a quantum geometric framework for nonlinear photon-drag phenomena and highlight moiré bilayers as promising platforms for large, highly tunable optoelectronic responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic areas spread in two-dimensional Superconducting Quantum Interference Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15020v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), formed by incorporating Josephson junctions into loops of superconducting material, are the backbone of many modern quantum sensing systems. It has been demonstrated that, by combining multiple SQUID loops into a two-dimensional (2D) array, it is possible to fabricate ultra-high-performing Radio frequency sensors. However, to function as absolute magnetometers, current-in-use arrays require the area of each SQUID loop in the array to be incommensurate and, in turn, forbid the achievement of their full potential in terms of quantum-limited performances. This is because imposing incommensurability in the areas contrasts with optimised performance in each single SQUID loop. In this work, we report that by selectively inserting bare sections of a superconducting circuit with no Josephson junctions, 2D SQUID arrays can operate as an absolute magnetometer even when no physical area spread is applied. Based on a generalisation of current available theories, a complete analytical formulation for the one-to-one correspondence between the distribution of these bare loops and what we call a synthetic area spread is unveiled. This synthetic spread represents the equivalent physical spread of incommensurate SQUID loops that you will use to obtain the absolute Voltage-Magnetic Flux response if no bare loops were in use. Our work opens the way to a broader use of this technology for the fabrication of ultra-high-performance absolute quantum sensors. Our approach is also experimentally verified by fabricating several 2D SQUID arrays incorporating bare superconducting loops and by demonstrating that they behave in alignment with what is suggested by our theory.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 Figure |
| **[Hybrid Predictive Quantum Feedback: Extending Qubit Lifetimes Beyond the Wiseman-Milburn Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13774v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amplitude damping fundamentally limits qubit lifetimes by irreversibly leaking energy and information into the environment. Standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement because it acts on a single measured quadrature and its corrective drive is degraded by loop delay. We introduce a compact hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled \emph{ancilla} qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back \emph{quantum-coherently} on the system, recovering information from \emph{both} field quadratures and intentionally engineered to decay much faster than the system; and (ii) a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency. A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Using IBM-scale parameters (baseline \(T_1 = 50~μ\mathrm{s}\)), numerical simulations surpass the W--M limit, achieving \(\sim 3\!-\!4\times\) longer \(T_1\) together with improved population retention and integrated energy. The method is modular and hardware-compatible: ancilla coupling and supervised prediction can be added to existing W--M loops to convert leaked information into a precise, time-advanced corrective drive. We also include a detailed, student-friendly derivation of the effective rates for both ancilla-assisted and prediction-enhanced feedback, making the impact of each design element analytically transparent.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Classical algorithms for estimating expectation values in linear-optical circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12882v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a classical algorithm for approximating the expectation values of observables in linear-optical circuits with arbitrary product input states, achieving additive-error accuracy. This result indicates that current applications of photonic systems aimed at demonstrating practical quantum supremacy through expectation value estimation, such as photonic variational algorithms, may face challenges in attaining the computational advantage. It also implies the output probabilities of boson sampling with arbitrary product input states can be efficiently approximated by our method, resulting that boson sampling becomes efficiently simulable when its output probability distribution is polynomially sparse. We also develop an efficient classical algorithm for estimating transition amplitudes of arbitrary product states in linear-optical circuits. This provides additive-error approximation algorithms for matrix functions associated with linear-optical circuits, such as the (loop-)hafnian, which are of independent interest. As an application, it solves the generalized molecular vibronic spectra problem (Oh et al., 2024), previously suggested as a candidate for practical quantum advantage. Finally, we extend our framework to near-Clifford circuits, enabling classical approximation of their expectation values.</p></details> | 8+12 pages, 1 figure |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of competing bond-order and loop-current fluctuations as a possible mechanism for superconductivity in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00134v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pairing symmetry and underlying mechanism for superconducting state of AV${}_3$Sb${}_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) kagome metal has been a topic of intense investigation. In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $θ$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $π$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120°, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations.

| **[Loop current order on the kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01648v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent discoveries in kagome materials have unveiled their capacity to harbor exotic quantum states, including intriguing charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schrödinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 2 appendices</p></details> |

A paradigmatic example is the quantum Ising magnet, where transverse field $g$ controlling quantum fluctuations can expand the quantum critical point into an extended quantum critical regime. In this work, we propose a distinct quantum supercritical regime originating also from the quantum critical point but controlled by the longitudinal field $h$ coupled to the order parameter. Through thermal tensor network simulations, we find the quantum supercritical regime is enclosed by the finite-temperature crossover boundaries $T \propto h^{{zν}/Δ}$, where $z$, $ν$ and $Δ\equiv β+γ$ are critical exponents. We comprehend the supercritical scaling via thermal data collapse based on the derived scaling form. Amongst other intriguing phenomena in quantum supercritical regime, there exists an enhanced magnetocaloric effect characterized by a universally diverging magnetic Grüneisen ratio $Γ_h \propto T^{-Δ/{zν}}$, which indicates that a small symmetry-breaking field $h$ can generate dramatic temperature variation. We propose to observe the quantum supercritical regime in Ising-chain compound CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related quantum materials, revealing a helium-3-free pathway to millikelvin cooling via the supercritical magnetocaloric effect.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures; to appear in Nat.

Yet, due to challenges in interpretability of machine learning techniques, the question of what physics machine learning models are able to learn remains open. Here we bridge the concept a physical quantity and its machine learning approximation in the context of the original application of neural networks in physics: topological phase classification. We construct a hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping stone towards more accurate and better generalizable machine learning representations in condensed matter physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+8 p...</summary><p>5+8 pages, 4+7 figures</p></details> |

The approach exploits causal light-cone structure by interleaving time and space evolution and applying projective measurements as soon as local subsystems reach the target physical time, suppressing entanglement growth. Comparing to time-evolving block decimation, the method reaches longer times per sample for the same resources. We also gain the ability to study dynamics of entanglement that would be occurring on quantum hardware when following similar protocols, such as the holographic quantum dynamics simulation framework. We show how to efficiently obtain local observables as well as equal-time and time-dependent correlation functions. Our findings show how optimizations for quantum hardware can benefit classical tensor network simulations and how such classical methods can yield insights into the utility of quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+4 ...</summary><p>14+4 pages (main + appendix), 10+6 figures</p></details> |

However, the growing diversity of simulation methods and software tools creates a high barrier to selecting the most suitable backend for a given circuit. We introduce Maestro, a unified interface for quantum circuit simulation that integrates multiple simulation paradigms - state vector, MPS, tensor network, stabilizer, GPU-accelerated, and p-block methods - under a single API. Maestro includes a predictive runtime model that automatically selects the optimal simulator based on circuit structure and available hardware, and applies backend-specific optimizations such as multiprocessing, GPU execution, and improved sampling. Benchmarks across heterogeneous workloads demonstrate that Maestro outperforms individual simulators in both single-circuit and large batched settings, particularly in high-performance computing environments. Maestro provides a scalable, extensible platform for quantum algorithm research, hybrid quantum-classical workflows, and emerging distributed quantum computing architectures.</p></details> |  |

By measuring entanglement and non-stabilizerness on MPS-encoded functions, we estimate the computational complexity encountered by a stabilizer or a tensor network solver applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations across different flow regimes. Our analysis reveals that, under specific initial conditions, the shear width identifies a transition between resource-efficient and resource-intensive regimes for non-trivial evolution. Furthermore, we find that the two resources qualitatively track each other in time, and that the mesh resolution along with the sign structure play a crucial role in determining the resource content of the encoded state. These findings offer useful guidelines for the development of scalable, quantum-inspired approaches to fluid dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+5 p...</summary><p>6+5 pages.

However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages + 23 pages of appendices, 12 figures. v2: added references</p></details> |

We describe the phases systematically in terms of both information-theoretic diagnostics and spontaneous breaking of strong and weak symmetries of the dynamics. We find a completely broken phase where information is retained by the quantum system, a strong-to-weak broken phase where information is leaked to the environment, and an unbroken phase where information is learned by the observer. We find that weak measurement and dephasing alone constitute a minimal model for generic open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, but we also explore perturbations by unitary gates. For a 1d set of qubits, we examine information-theoretic and symmetry-breaking observables in the path integral of the doubled state. This path integral reduces to the standard classical 2d random-bond Ising model in certain limits but generically involves negative weights, enabling a special self-dual random-bond Ising model at the critical point when only measurements are present. We obtain numerical evidence for the steady-state phases using efficient tensor network simulations of the doubled state.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

Highly precise predictions can be made using standard techniques, both in the continuum and in the lattice frameworks. However, classical methods have limitations, particularly when attempting to extrapolate the continuum limit from the study of lattice gauge theories. Complementing classical computations or combining them with quantum computational methods, to improve the predictions towards the continuum limit with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages + 17 pages appendix/references, 9 figures; updated version after acceptance</p></details> |

In particular, we focus on the Hilbert curve, whose locality-preserving structure minimizes the range of effective interactions in the mapped model. This enables a more compact matrix product state (MPS) representation compared to conventional snake mapping. Through systematic benchmarks, we show that the Hilbert curve consistently yields lower ground-state energies at fixed bond dimension, with the advantage increasing for larger system sizes and in physically relevant interaction regimes. Our implementation reaches clusters up to $32\times32$ sites with open and periodic boundary conditions, delivering reliable ground-state energies and correlation functions in agreement with established results, but at significantly reduced computational cost. These findings establish space-filling curve mappings, particularly the Hilbert curve, as a powerful tool for extending tensor-network studies of strongly correlated two-dimensional quantum systems beyond the limits accessible with standard approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

However, experimentally resolving the Ising meson spectroscopy required to verify these symmetries is challenging on near-term quantum hardware due to the depth of circuits required for real-time evolution. Here, we demonstrate improved spectroscopy of confined excitations using two distinct error-resilient circuit construction techniques on the IBM Torino device: first-order Trotter decomposition utilizing native fractional gates, and a tensor-network-based circuit compression via Riemannian optimization. By analyzing the Fourier spectrum of error-mitigated time-series data, we successfully identify key signatures of $E_8$ symmetry despite hardware noise. These results validate the viability of both circuit compression and hardware-efficient compilation for probing complex topological phenomena on NISQ devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Yet the prevailing framework for superchannels is both internally inconsistent, owing to the coexistence of distinct Choi operator constructions, and structurally incomplete, lacking the analogue of representations that ground channel theory. We resolve these issues by combining tensor-network methods with a generalized Occam's razor introduced here, establishing a unified foundation for superchannels. Our framework establishes the connections between competing Choi formulations, develops the Kraus, Stinespring, and Liouville representations for superchannels, and provides a simplified derivation of the realization theorem that identifies the minimal memory required to implement a given transformation. These structural tools also enable characterizations of superchannels that destroy quantum correlations or causal structure, opening a systematic route to non-Markovian quantum dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, many figures</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Time Evolution of 2D Open-Quantum Lattice Models with Long-Range Interactions using Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01781v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating many-body open quantum systems is an extremely challenging problem, with methods often restricted to either models with nearest-neighbor interactions or semi-classical approximations. In particular, modeling two-dimensional systems with realistic long-range interactions, in addition to dissipation, is of vital importance to the development of modern quantum computing and simulation platforms. In this paper, we present a construction of the time-evolution operator, as a projected entangled pair operator (denoted tePEPO), that can be used to evolve a tensor network ansatz through time. Interactions beyond nearest-neighbor, including interactions between sites not collinear in the lattice, can be represented efficiently as a tePEPO. Furthermore, we obtain approximations to realistic radial long-range interactions decaying with a power-law, that give accurate results with small tePEPO bond dimension. Finally, we consider a physical example of a Rydberg atom Hamiltonian with long-range dipolar interactions, and show evidence of a dipole-dipole blockading effect in presence of dissipation. This work demonstrates the applicability of tensor networks to two-dimensional systems widely studied in experiments, but previously inaccessible to non-semi-classical methods.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\langle \langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle \rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

While analytical studies have established the inequality $S_h \geq S_c$, numerical investigations suggest that the two values are very close. In this work, we revisit this problem using high-precision tensor-network methods. In Monte Carlo approaches the residual entropy cannot be directly obtained by sampling the ground-state degeneracy space, however, the tensor-network framework enables an explicit encoding of the "ice rule'' into local tensors, and then the residual entropy is transformed into finding the largest eigenvalue of a transfer operator in the form of a projected entangled-pair operator, which allows high-accuracy numerical evaluation. Meanwhile, we propose a new perspective based on analyzing the normality of the transfer operator, and demonstrate that if the operator is normal, the equality $S_h = S_c$ follows directly. Then the variational tensor network methods are employed to numerically verify this normality. Finally both residual entropies are directly computed by using our recently developed split corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm, providing a rigorous evidence supporting the equality between $S_h$ and $S_c$.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, two tables</p></details> |

The parameters of these ansatzes can be initialized from the output of a coupled cluster, singles and doubles (CCSD) calculation performed on a classical computer. However, truncating the number of repetitions of the ansatz, as well as discarding interactions to accommodate the connectivity constraints of near-term quantum processors, degrade the approximation to CCSD and the resulting energy accuracy. In this work, we propose two methods to improve the parameter initialization. The first method, which is applicable to both expectation value- and sample-based algorithms, uses compressed double factorization of the CCSD amplitudes to improve or recover the CCSD approximation. The second method, which is applicable to sample-based algorithms, uses approximate tensor network simulation to improve the quality of samples produced by the ansatz circuit. We validate our methods using exact state vector simulation on systems of up to 52 qubits, as well as experiments on superconducting quantum processors using up to 65 qubits. Our results indicate that our methods can significantly improve the output of both expectation value- and sample-based quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exponential distillation of dominant eigenproperties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04380v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating observable expectation values in eigenstates of quantum systems has a broad range of applications and is an area where early fault-tolerant quantum computers may provide practical quantum advantage. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that enables the estimation of an arbitrary observable expectation value in an eigenstate, given an initial state is supplied that has dominant overlap with the targeted eigenstate -- but may overlap with any other eigenstates. Our approach builds on, and is conceptually similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then virtually purified with exponential efficacy. We prove rigorous performance guarantees and conclude that the complexity of our approach depends directly on the energy gap in the problem Hamiltonian and remarkably, can be compared to phase estimation combined with amplitude estimation in terms of its scaling with respect to a target precision. We demonstrate in a broad range of numerical simulations the applicability of our framework in near-term and early fault-tolerant settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a 100-qubit example that direct classical simulation of our approach enables the prediction of ground and excited state properties of quantum systems using tensor network techniques, which we recognize as a quantum-inspired classical approach.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |

In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

However, commonly used stochastic gradient-based methods often perform poorly on these parameter training problems and typically lack convergence guarantees. The stochastic reconfiguration (SR) method provides a robust preconditioner of the stochastic gradient, whose computational cost becomes prohibitive for large parameter spaces owing to the repeated inversion of large covariance matrices. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a warm-started stochastic reconfiguration (WSSR) method, which integrates warm-start techniques from singular value decomposition (SVD) to refine low-rank approximations of the preconditioning matrix iteratively. Numerical experiments on typical atomic and molecular systems highlight the effectiveness of the WSSR method within VMC calculations.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

However, conventional sampling schemes often require a large number of samples to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this work we propose the concentrated Monte Carlo sampling approach, which builds on the idea that in systems with only short range correlations, to obtain accurate expectation values for local observables, one would favor detailed information in the surroundings of this observable compared to far away from it. In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. Our results demonstrate that CMCS yields higher accuracy for local observables in short-range correlated states while requiring substantially fewer samples, showcasing in which regimes one can obtain acceleration for the evaluation of expectation values.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Probing chiral topological states with permutation defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04649v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hallmark of two-dimensional chiral topological phases is the existence of anomalous gapless modes at the spatial boundary. Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating "permutation defects" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>16+14...</summary><p>16+14 pages, 20 figures, comments welcome!</p></details> |
| **[Phase transitions on the dark side of the Gross-Neveu model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04626v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Enhanced Quantum Circuit Cutting Framework for Sampling Overhead Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17704v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently developed quantum circuit cutting technique greatly extends the capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, it introduces substantial overhead in both classical postprocessing and quantum resources, as the postprocessing complexity and sampling cost scale exponentially with the number of circuit cuts. In this work, we propose an enhanced circuit cutting framework, ShotQC, which effectively reduces the sampling overhead through two key optimizations: shot distribution and cut parameterization. The former employs an adaptive Monte Carlo strategy to dynamically allocate more quantum resources to subcircuit configurations that contribute more to the variance in the final outcome. The latter exploits additional degrees of freedom in postprocessing to further suppress variance. Integrating these optimizations, ShotQC significantly reduces the sampling overhead without increasing classical postprocessing complexity, as demonstrated across a range of benchmark circuits.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Sign-Resolved Statistics and the Origin of Bias in Quantum Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04056v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulations are a powerful tool for exploring strongly correlated many-body phenomena. Yet, their reach is limited by the fermion sign problem, which causes configuration weights to become negative, compromising statistical sampling. In auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the doped Hubbard model, neglecting the sign ${\cal S}$ of the weight leads to qualitatively wrong results -- most notably, an apparent suppression rather than enhancement of $d$-wave pairing at low temperature. Here we approach the problem from a different perspective: instead of identifying negative-weight paths, we examine the statistics of measured observables in a sign-resolved manner. By analyzing histograms of key quantities (kinetic energy, antiferromagnetic structure factor, and pair susceptibilities) for configurations with ${\cal S}=\pm1$, we derive an exact relation linking the bias from ignoring the sign to the difference between sign-resolved means, $Δμ$, and the average sign, $\langle {\cal S}\rangle$. Our framework provides a precise diagnostic of the origin of measurement bias in Quantum Monte Carlo and clarifies why observables such as the $d$-wave susceptibility are especially sensitive to the sign problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages; 4+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations by delayed update and block force-bias update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09611v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) methods have become key numerical tools for studying quantum phases and phase transitions in interacting many-fermion systems. Despite the broad applicability, the efficiency of these algorithms is often limited by the bottleneck associated with the {\it local update} of the field configuration. In this work, we propose two novel update schemes, the {\it delayed update} and {\it block force-bias update}, both of which can generally and efficiently accelerate ground-state AFQMC simulations. The {\it delayed update}, with a predetermined delay rank, is an elegantly improved version of the {\it local update}, accelerating the process by replacing multiple vector-vector outer products in the latter with a single matrix-matrix multiplication. The {\it block force-bias update} is a block variant of the conventional force-bias update, which is a highly efficient scheme for dilute systems but suffers from the low acceptance ratio in lattice models. Our modified scheme maintains the high efficiency while offering flexible tuning of the acceptance ratio, controlled by the block size, for any desired fermion filling. We apply these two update schemes to both the standard and spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional Hubbard models, demonstrating their speedup over the {\it local update} with respect to the delay rank and block size. We also explore their efficiencies across varying system sizes and model parameters. Our results identify a speedup of $\sim$$8$ for systems with $\sim$$1600$ lattice sites. Furthermore, we have investigated the broader applications as well as an application diagram of these update schemes to general correlated fermion systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[On the Convergence of Markov Chain Distribution within Quantum Walk Circuit Subspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12089v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are algorithms for sampling probability distributions, commonly applied to the Boltzmann distribution in physical and chemical models such as protein folding and the Ising model. These methods enable exploration of such systems by sampling their most probable states. However, sampling multidimensional and multimodal distributions with MCMC requires substantial computational resources, leading to the development of techniques aimed at improving sampling efficiency. In this context, quantum computing, with its potential to accelerate classical methods, emerges as a promising solution to the sampling problem. In this work, we present the design of a new circuit based on the Discrete Quantum Walk (DQW) algorithm to perform MCMC sampling over a desired distributions. Simulation results show convergence behavior in the superposition of the quantum register that encodes the target distribution. This design is further refined to increase convergence speed and, consequently, the scalability of the algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures (4 of them composed by 6, 3, 3 and 2 subfigures respectively)</p></details> |
| **[Tractable Infinite-Horizon Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Quantum Filtering via Eigenstate Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05916v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model predictive control has shown potential to enhance the robustness of quantum control systems. In this work, we propose a tractable Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework for finite-dimensional quantum systems under continuous-time measurement and quantum filtering. Using the almost-sure eigenstate reduction of quantum trajectories, we prove that the infinite-horizon stochastic objective collapses to a fidelity term that is computable in closed form from the one-step averaged state. Consequently, the online SMPC step requires only deterministic propagation of the filter and a terminal fidelity evaluation. An advantage of this method is that it eliminates per-horizon Monte Carlo scenario sampling and significantly reduces computational load while retaining the essential stochastic dynamics. We establish equivalence and mean-square stability guarantees, and validate the approach on multi-level and Ising-type systems, demonstrating favorable scalability compared to sampling-based SMPC.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Motivated by the experimental reports, here we study an 11-band $d-p$ Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations, using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the major superexchange couplings in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films can be substantially weaker than in the bulk material at 29.5 Gpa. Specifically, the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is reduced by about 27\% in film, while the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unaffected. We evaluate the corresponding antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\perp}$ and $J_{\parallel}$ using perturbation theory. With regard to charge transfer properties, we find that the biaxial compression in films reduces charge transfer gap. We also resolve the orbital distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals, uncovering a pronounced particle-hole asymmetry. Theses findings lay a groundwork for the study of low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and provide key insights into the understanding of physical distinctions between the film and bulk bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Spinons and Spin-Charge Separation at the Deconfined Quantum Critical Point](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02962v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using quantum Monte Carlo and numerical analytic continuation methods, we study the dynamic spin structure factor and the single-hole spectral function of a two-dimensional quantum magnet ($J$-$Q$ model) at its quantum phase transition separating Néel antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states. At this putative deconfined quantum-critical point, we find a broad continuum of spinon excitations that can be accounted for by the fermionic $π$-flux state; a known mean-field model for deconfined quantum criticality. We find that the best description of the two-spinon continuum is with a version of the model with a $2\times 2$ unit cell, reflecting non-trivial mutual statistics of spinons and anti-spinons. The single-hole spectral function can be described by the same spinon dispersion relation and an independently propagating holon. Thus, the system exhibits spin-charge separation and will likely evolve into an extended holon metal phase at finite doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Rev. A 107, 033320 (2023)] onto a one-dimensional system of massive and interacting chiral fermions, whose mass and interactions are set by the filling factor of the quantum Hall fluid and the shape of the external confining potential at the position of the edge. As an example of the predictive power of the refermionized theory, we report a detailed study of the dynamic structure factor and of the spectral function of a fractional quantum Hall cloud. Among other features, our refermionized theory provides a physical understanding of the effective decay of the edge excitations and of the universal power-law exponents at the thresholds of the dynamic structure factor. The quantitative accuracy of the refermionized theory is validated against a full two-dimensional calculation based on a combination of exact diagonalization and Monte Carlo sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+6 ...</summary><p>13+6 pages, 10+4 figures</p></details> |

In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in almost all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: a...</summary><p>v2: additional experiments and results included, typo corrected. v3: inference experiments redone, all results updated, conclusions remain qualitatively the same</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01264v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the VMC optimization part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through VMC, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Boltzmann Machines by Parallelizable Sampler and Efficient Temperature Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02323v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Uncertainty Principle and Angular Momentum Generation in Microscopic Fission Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02207v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of angular momentum (intrinsic spin) in fission fragments has recently attracted renewed attention. While several microscopic approaches reproduce the spin distribution qualitatively using projection techniques, the physical origin of the fragments' angular momentum in density functional theory remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms responsible for the spin distribution of fission fragments within a microscopic TDDFT framework. We compare spin distributions obtained from projection operators with those predicted by a simple expression derived from the uncertainty relation between angle and angular momentum, where angular fluctuations are estimated using a Monte Carlo sampling of nucleon positions. We find that a large portion of the spin distribution obtained from projection methods can be explained by the uncertainty principle. Our results thus show that, within microscopic approaches, the spin of fission fragments originates primarily from quantum uncertainty associated with their orientation angle with respect to the fission axis, mainly due to quadrupole deformation and, to a lesser extent, octupole deformation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Since its proposal, substantial effort has been invested in better understanding the problem for physically motivated important families of Hamiltonians. In particular, the QMA-completeness of approximating the ground state energy of local Hamiltonians has been extended to the case where the Hamiltonians are geometrically local in one and two spatial dimensions. Among those physically motivated Hamiltonians, stoquastic Hamiltonians play a particularly crucial role, as they constitute the manifestly sign-free Hamiltonians in Monte Carlo approaches. Interestingly, for such Hamiltonians, the problem at hand becomes more ''classical'', being hard for the class MA (the randomized version of NP) and its complexity has tight connections with derandomization. In this work, we prove that both the two- and one-dimensional geometrically local analogues remain MA-hard with high enough qudit dimension. Moreover, we show that related problems are StoqMA-complete.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision incorporating referee feedback, correcting typos, and improving exposition and organization</p></details> |

Theoretical study of such states is however challenging owing to their strong-coupling nature that prevents conventional mean-field treatment. Here, we demonstrate that an attention-based deep neural network provides an expressive variational wavefunction that discovers fractional Chern insulator ground states purely through energy minimization without prior knowledge and achieves remarkable accuracy. We introduce an efficient method to extract ground state topological degeneracy -- a hallmark of topological order -- from a single optimized real-space wavefunction in translation-invariant systems by decomposing it into different many-body momentum sectors. Our results establish neural network variational Monte Carlo as a versatile tool for discovering strongly correlated topological phases.</p></details> | 5 pages + 6 SM |

As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis defended on 27th November 2025 at the University of Valencia; 185 pages of work; 205 pages including preliminaries and covers</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(β_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, theoretical study on condensed matter physics (honeycomb lattice Holstein model); no generative AI tools used in research</p></details> |

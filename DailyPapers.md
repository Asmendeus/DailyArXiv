| **[Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of superconducting (La,Pr)3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09255v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate thin film superconductors discovered under ambient pressure enable vast possibilities for investigating electronic structures of the superconducting state. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 films grown on SrLaAlO4 substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced p-d hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest potential for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating fluid vortex interactions on a superconducting quantum processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04023v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vortex interactions are commonly observed in atmospheric turbulence, plasma dynamics, and collective behaviors in biological systems. However, accurately simulating these complex interactions is highly challenging due to the need to capture fine-scale details over extended timescales, which places computational burdens on traditional methods. In this study, we introduce a quantum vortex method, reformulating the Navier--Stokes (NS) equations within a quantum mechanical framework to enable the simulation of multi-vortex interactions on a quantum computer. We construct the effective Hamiltonian for the vortex system and implement a spatiotemporal evolution circuit to simulate its dynamics over prolonged periods. By leveraging eight qubits on a superconducting quantum processor with gate fidelities of 99.97\% for single-qubit gates and 99.76\% for two-qubit gates, we successfully reproduce natural vortex interactions. This method bridges classical fluid dynamics and quantum computing, offering a novel computational platform for studying vortex dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum computing to tackle longstanding challenges in fluid dynamics and broaden applications across both natural and engineering systems.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nernst effect and its thickness dependence in superconducting NbN films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03975v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279v8)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective of physics of information dynamics, modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Numerical simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Loop network topology abstraction using the model separates the flowing patterns of information from its physical constraints and describes systems of any scale and complexity. The accuracy of flow statistics are limited by the resolution of local external measuring clock(s) revealing the universal nature of information dynamics through the stated two principles.</p></details> | 6 figures, 26 pages |
| **[Simulating non-Abelian statistics of parafermions with superconducting processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20254v5)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose a novel experimental scheme for the quantum simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding statistics in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the topologically ordered ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding of parafermions, and show the application of this approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermions. We also examine the real experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility of our scheme in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulations of topological defects in SC qubits to qudit systems and opens up a promising way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages and 5 figures.

| **[Enhanced and modulable induced superconducting gap and effective Land√© g-factor in Pb-InSb hybrid devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03563v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hybrid system of a conventional superconductor (SC) on a semiconductor (SM) nanowire with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) represents a promising platform for achieving topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) towards topological quantum computation. While aluminum (Al)-based hybrid nanowire devices have been widely utilized, their limited superconducting gap and intrinsic weak SOC as well as small Land\'e g-factor may hinder future experimental advancements. In contrast, we demonstrate that lead (Pb)-based hybrid quantum devices exhibit a remarkably large and hard proximity-induced superconducting gap, exceeding that of Al by an order of magnitude. By exploiting electrostatic gating to modulate wavefunction distribution and SC-SM interfacial coupling, this gap can be continuously tuned from its maximum value (~1.4 meV, matching the bulk Pb gap) down to nearly zero while maintaining the hardness. Furthermore, magnetic-field-dependent measurements reveal a radial evolution of the gap structure with anti-crossing feature, indicative of strong SOC and huge effective g-factors up to 76. These findings underscore the superior functionality of Pb-based hybrid systems, significantly advancing their potential for realizing and stabilizing MZMs and the further scalable topological quantum architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiband superconductivity in the topological Kramers nodal-line semimetals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03509v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent band-structure calculations predict that the ruthenium-based ternary silicides are three-dimensional Kramers nodal line semimetals. Among them, NbRuSi and TaRuSi show bulk superconductivity (SC) below $T_c \sim 3$ K and 4 K, as well as spontaneous magnetic fields. The latter indicates the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and, thus, unconventional SC in both compounds. Previous temperature-dependent muon-spin spectroscopy studies failed to distinguish whether such compounds exhibit single-gap or multi-gap SC. Here, we report on systematic measurements of the field-dependent muon-spin relaxation rates in the superconducting state and on temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and specific heat under applied magnetic fields. Both the upper critical field and the field-dependent superconducting relaxation are well described by a two-band model. By combining our experimental results with numerical band-structure calculations, we provide solid evidence for multiband SC in NbRuSi and TaRuSi, and thus offer further insight into the unconventional- and topological nature of their superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Ultracoherent superconducting cavity-based multiqudit platform with error-resilient control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03286v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times and large accessible Hilbert spaces, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with coherence-limited fidelities reaching up to 99.9% after post-selection. These results establish our platform as a robust foundation for quantum information processing, allowing for future extensions to high-dimensional qudit encodings.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 3 main figures and 8 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Phonon-Mediated Intrinsic Topological Superconductivity in Fermi Arcs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03250v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose that phonons can mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we demonstrate that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a wide range of chemical potentials. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave superconductivity in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we show a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the arc, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+10 ...</summary><p>6+10 pages, 3+4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Microscopic scales and mechanism of quantum phase transitions in two-dimensional superconducting systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00747v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting ground state in many two-dimensional materials can be created or destroyed through quantum phase transitions (QPTs) controlled by non-thermal parameters such as carrier density or magnetic field. While various mechanisms for these QPTs have been proposed, it remains unclear which, if any, are applicable to a specific two-dimensional superconducting system. Here, we find that a pair-breaking mechanism which suppresses the Cooper pair density gives a unifying description of magnetic-field-driven QPTs in amorphous MoGe, Pb and TaN films, and the high-temperature superconductor La$_{1.92}$Sr$_{0.08}$CuO$_{4}$. This transition occurs within the superconducting subsystem and is masked by the dominant non-critical contribution of normal electrons. The discovery was enabled by the development of a QPT model that goes beyond the conventional determination of the critical exponents and incorporates into the analysis a microscopic length scale characterizing the transitions. We found that in the materials studied, and MoGe nanowires, this scale corresponds to the size of a Cooper pair. The model has also been successfully applied to QPTs in Josephson junction arrays and various non-superconducting materials. The observation that microscopic scales are encoded in the scaled experimental data of QPTs likely extends beyond equilibrium condensed matter physics and may reveal underlying principles of critical phenomena in a wide variety of systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation in Hybrid Normal-Superconducting Systems: The Role of superconducting coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02904v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in hybrid superconducting systems consisting of one superconducting and two normal leads coupled to a central region containing localized levels, focusing on the role of quantum coherence. We first study the simplest setup yielding TUR violations, where the central region is a single-level quantum dot and only one normal lead is connected. In addition to the {\it classical} TUR, we consider an alternative formulation recently derived for coherent conductors. We find even the latter TUR is violated (although by a smaller extent) as a result of the macroscopic coherence related to the superconducting condensate. To support this conclusion, we connect the second normal lead as a dephasing probe, demonstrating that the violation is directly correlated with the superconducting coherence, as measured by the dot's pair amplitude. When the central region is a Cooper-pair splitter, crossed Andreev processes introduce nonlocal superconducting correlations that further enhance the quantum-TUR violation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[State Similarity in Modular Superconducting Quantum Processors with Classical Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01657v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum devices continue to scale, distributed quantum computing emerges as a promising strategy for executing large-scale tasks across modular quantum processors. A central challenge in this paradigm is verifying the correctness of computational outcomes when subcircuits are executed independently following circuit cutting. Here we propose a cross-platform fidelity estimation algorithm tailored for modular architectures. Our method achieves substantial reductions in sample complexity compared to previous approaches designed for single-processor systems. We experimentally implement the protocol on modular superconducting quantum processors with up to 6 qubits to verify the similarity of two 11-qubit GHZ states. Beyond verification, we show that our algorithm enables a federated quantum kernel method that preserves data privacy. As a proof of concept, we apply it to a 5-qubit quantum phase learning task using six 3-qubit modules, successfully extracting phase information with just eight training samples. These results establish a practical path for scalable verification and trustworthy quantum machine learning of modular quantum processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 26-page appendix, with affiliation typo corrected</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting integrated random access quantum memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02570v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for the development of quantum repeaters and resource-efficient quantum processors. We report the experimental realization of a novel architecture of superconducting random access quantum memory with cycling storage time, achieved through pulsed control of an RF-SQUID coupling element. The device demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and achieves 57.5\% fidelity with preservation of the input pulse shape during the first retrieval interval for near-single-photon level excitations, with subsequent exponential decay characterized by a time constant of 11.44 $\mu s$. This performance represents a several-fold improvement over previously reported implementations. Crucially, we establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching imperfections. These results highlight the potential of proposed architecture for quantum memory applications while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic superconducting gap probed by $^{125}$Te NMR in noncentrosymmetric Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, Co)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02484v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting gap symmetry is investigated by $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, Co) without spatial inversion symmetry. The spin susceptibility obtained from the Knight shift $K$ is suppressed below the superconducting transition temperature, while leaving a finite value down to the lowest temperature ($\simeq 0.4$ K). The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ follows a power law against temperature $T$ without showing a coherence peak characteristic of the isotropic gap. The result implies a pairing admixture or a residual density of states under magnetic field. The normal metallic state has a Korringa scaling relation between $1/T_1T$ and the Knight shift, reflecting a weak electron correlation.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Anyon superconductivity and plateau transitions in doped fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02108v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments reported evidence of superconductivity and re-entrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) insulator upon doping the $\nu_e = 2/3$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall states (FQAH) in twisted MoTe${}_2$, separated by narrow resistive regions. Anyons of a FQAH generally have a finite effective mass, and when described by anyon-flux composite fermions (CF), experience statistical magnetic fields with a commensurate filling. Here, we show that most of the experimental observations can be explained by invoking the effects of disorder on the Landau-Hofstadter bands of CFs. In particular, by making minimal assumptions about the anyon energetics and dispersion, we show that doping anyons drives plateau transitions of CFs into integer quantum Hall states, which physically corresponds to either to a superconductor or to a RIQAH phase. We develop a dictionary that allows us to infer the response in these phases and the critical regions from the knowledge of the response functions of the plateau transitions. In particular, this allows us to relate the superfluid stiffness of the superconductor to the polarizability of CFs. As a first step towards a quantitative understanding, we borrow results from the celebrated integer quantum Hall plateau transitions to make quantitative prediction for the critical behavior of the superfluid stiffness, longitudinal and Hall conductivity, and response to out-of-plane magnetic field, all of which agree reasonably well with the experimental observations. Our results provide strong support for anyon superconductivity being the mechanism for the observed superconductor in the vicinity of the $\nu_e = 2/3$ FQAH insulator.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Flux Trapping Characterization for Superconducting Electronics Using a Cryogenic Widefield NV-Diamond Microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01906v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic flux trapping is a significant hurdle limiting reliability and scalability of superconducting electronics, yet tools for imaging flux vortices remain slow or insensitive. We present a cryogenic widefield NV-diamond magnetic microscope capable of rapid, micron-scale imaging of flux trapping in superconducting devices. Using this technique, we measure vortex expulsion fields in Nb thin films and patterned strips, revealing a crossover in expulsion behavior between $10$ and $20~\mu$m strip widths. The observed scaling agrees with theoretical models and suggests the influence of film defects on vortex expulsion dynamics. This instrument enables high-throughput magnetic characterization of superconducting materials and circuits, providing new insight for flux mitigation strategies in scalable superconducting electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages main text (5 figures), 3 pages supplementary information (3 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Materials-Level Sources of Performance Variation in Superconducting Transmon Qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14424v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting diode effect in a meso-wedge geometry with Abrikosov vortices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01797v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we explore the behavior of a superconducting meso-wedge geometry in 3+1 dimensions (three spatial dimensions plus time) subjected to external transport currents at its boundaries and surfaces, as well as external fields applied along the $\hat{z}$-direction. The transport currents are included as two opposite polarities, $\textbf{J}>0$ and $\textbf{J}<0$. Using the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory and considering the order parameter $\kappa$, we focus on two scenarios: a fixed external magnetic field with variable $\kappa$, and fixed $\kappa$ with variable external magnetic field. As a result, under both scenarios, we analyze the voltage-current characteristics of the superconducting meso-wedge, finding that the critical currents differ between polarities, demonstrating the system's non-reciprocity. We further examine the efficiency of the diode as a function of $\kappa$ and the external magnetic field applied. Furthermore, our observations reveal that the current polarity strongly influences the vortex configuration, the parameter $\kappa$, and the applied magnetic field. In particular, the formation of Abrikosov-type vortices exhibits pronounced inhomogeneity depending on the direction of the transport currents. This underscores that the diode effect in the superconducting meso-wedge is intimately associated with the anisotropic nucleation of Abrikosov vortices. Notably, the emergence of polarity-dependent vortex patterns can serve as a distinctive hallmark of the diode effect in these superconducting systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting gaps revealed by STM measurements on La2PrNi2O7 thin films at ambient pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01788v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelate systems has generated tremendous interests in the field of superconductivity. The superconducting transition temperature above 80 K in La3Ni2O7 under pressure and the coexisting spin excitations certainly categorize the nickelate superconductors as unconventional. The core issue to understand the superconductivity mechanism is about the superconducting gap and its symmetry. By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we remove the surface layer and expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1 = 19 meV, Delta2 = 6 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, and the pure d-wave model fails to fit the data. Thus, our data put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Assuming the dominant interlayer superconducting gap, we obtain its magnitude to be Delta(perp) = 13 meV, while the intralayer gap Delta(para) is about 6 meV. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 4 figures for main-text, 4 figures for Extended data and Supplementary Information</p></details> |
| **[Unconventional Superconducting Pairing Symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: from the Perspective of Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis reveals that the chaotic phase of the bare Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian can actually be enhanced by the presence of a moderate tilt. We further unveil the development and scaling of the chaotic regime from the perspective of a homogeneous density configuration typically used in cold atom experiments, providing a valuable phase diagram for future theoretical and experimental studies of this system.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain implementing the full SU(N) symmetry via Semi-Standard Young Tableaux and Unitary Group Subduction Coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13320v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have developed an efficient method for performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain with open boundary conditions, fully leveraging the SU(N) symmetry of the problem. This method extends a previously developed approach for the SU(N) Heisenberg model and relies on the systematic use of the semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT) basis in a DMRG algorithm `a la White. Specifically, the method aligns the site-by-site growth process of the infinite-size part of the DMRG, in its original formulation, with the site-by-site construction of the SSYT (or Gelfand-like) basis, based on the chain of unitary subgroups $U(1)\subset U(2) \subset U(3) \subset U(4)\cdots $. We give special emphasis to the calculation of the symmetry-resolved reduced matrix elements of the hopping terms between the left and the right block, which makes direct use of the basis of SSYT and of the Gelfand-Tsetlin coefficients, offering a computational advantage in scaling with N compared to alternative methods that rely on summing over Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Focusing on the model with homogeneous hopping between nearest neighbors, we have calculated the ground state energy as a function of U, i.e the atom-atom interaction amplitude, up to N=6 for filling 1/N (one particle per site in average), and for one atom (resp. hole) away from filling 1/N, alllowing us to compute the charge gaps, and to estimate in the thermodynamical limit, the critical value $U_c$, separating the Mott insulator from the metallic phase. Central charges c are extracted from the entanglement entropy using the Calabrese-Cardy formula, and are consistent with the theoretical predictions: c=N-1, expected from the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten CFTs in the spin sector for the Mott phase, and c=N in the metallic phase, reflecting the presence of one additional (charge) gapless critical mode.</p></details> | Published version |
| **[Simplifying higher-order perturbation theory for ring-shaped Bose-Hubbard systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03029v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, higher-order perturbation theory is applied and tailored to one-dimensional ring-shaped Bose-Hubbard systems. Spectral and geometrical properties are used to structurally simplify the contributions and reduce computational effort without sacrificing accuracy. For this, a guide for the computation of the individual perturbational orders up to order nine is provided, alongside a both system-specific and parametrization-dependent convergence criterion. The simplification scheme described is found to be applicable to a wider class of Bose-Hubbard systems with different lattice geometries. An exemplary validation of these findings is included in the form of explicit calculations of ground state energies of the three-site Bose-Hubbard system with repulsive on-site interactions. These calculations are successfully checked against numerical computations of exact diagonalization results.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures. Phys.

| **[The SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard Model on two sites: Bethe Ansatz solution and Quantum Phase Transition of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model in the large-N limit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13327v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on two sites, where N is the number of flavors of each fermion, corresponds to an exactly solvable two-level many-boson model that Richardson [J. Math. Phys. 9, 1327 (1968)] analytically solved long ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the physical parameters of the SU(N) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and eigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. In this context, the connection with the well-studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves as a guideline to the prediction of some N-body physics phenomena in the two-site SU(N) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the SU(N) FHM for an attractive density-density interaction U equal to U_c=-1/(2N), in units of the (absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the finite-size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy, which all reveal the transition, as a function of U for values of N from N = 3 to N = 36, suggesting that the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies involving SU(N) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement entropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like N at the transition, in contrast with several two-mode models.</p></details> | Published Version |

We show that twisted square lattice homo-bilayers generically offer such tunability when the flat bands originate from the corner of the Brillouin zone. We reveal an emergent symmetry at low twist-angles, absent in single layers, that necessitates the vanishing of nearest neighbor hopping ($t=0$). This symmetry can be lifted by an inter-layer displacement field or by an in-plane magnetic field, introducing tunable $t$ and anisotropy, allowing access to a wide range of $t'/t$ ratios for correlated electrons on a moir\'e square lattice.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + End Matter + Supplementary</p></details> |

By employing the iterative generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA) within a time-linear framework, we avoid the computational cost of solving the full two-time Kadanoff-Baym equations. Spectral information is extracted by coupling the system to multiple narrow-band leads, establishing a direct analogy to photoemission experiments. Our results reveal correlation-induced shifts and broadenings of spectral features, along with a suppression of transient current oscillations. This approach provides a promising avenue for analyzing correlated electron dynamics in open quantum systems.</p></details> |  |

For a Hamiltonian \(H\) of such a model, we provide the condition on its parameters under which the \(\eta\)-pairing method can be employed to construct its exact eigenstates. We arrive at this condition by finding that the requirement for the \(\eta\)-pairing state \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\) to be an eigenstate of \(H\) is identical to the requirement for it to be an eigenstate of a Hubbard-type Hamiltonian \(H_m\). When the condition for \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\) to be an eigenstate of the Hubbard-type Hamiltonian \(H_m\) is satisfied, we demonstrate that there are additional states, distinct from \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\), which are also exact eigenstates of \(H_m\). Our results enhance the understanding of Hubbard models on general graphs, both with and without bond-charge interactions.</p></details> | 5 pages, 0 figures |

We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Spin stiffnesses and stability of magnetic order in the lightly doped two-dimensional Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12191v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the density dependence of the spin stiffnesses and the stability of magnetic order with respect to quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model close to half-filling. The stiffnesses are computed from the spin susceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically ordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a moderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a N\'eel antiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a planar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon electron doping, the N\'eel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply. By contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop abruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and then increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite temperatures, the N\'eel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped regime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they vanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe the quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero upon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the quantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains N\'eel ordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range order in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with a spin gap.</p></details> |  |

We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

The system is investigated under the competing effects of thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and a disorder term. We compute several observables, including the condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of quantum coherence, to characterize the transition from the Mott insulator to the superfluid phase. In the standard Bose-Hubbard model, ground-state properties exhibit signatures of a quantum phase transition under open boundary conditions. While finite-size effects preclude an exact realization of the thermodynamic transition, our findings serve as indicators of the underlying quantum critical behavior of the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. At finite temperatures, this critical point shifts to a smooth crossover, reflecting the suppression of long-range coherence typical of larger systems. A nonzero Stark potential delays this crossover, promoting localization and the formation of non-superfluid condensates. In contrast, thermal fluctuations can induce unexpected coherence through fluctuation-driven tunneling. Disorder disrupts superfluidity but preserves local coherence, with thermal states exhibiting an enhanced $\ell_1$-norm of coherence within the Bose glass regime. Our results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature jointly reshape the coherence landscape, and offer valuable insights for quantum simulation and the characterization of quantum phases in strongly correlated systems. Non-ergodic behavior is observed in the clean system where the mean gap ratio stays below Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) values. With a Stark potential, level statistics shift from Poisson-like to near-GOE as tunneling increases, which indicates a crossover to semi-ergodic dynamics.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figures |

This paper presents a novel perspective on the model, uncovering its inherent inverted duality which has profound implications for our comprehension of this complex system. Taking advantage of this special mathematical property, we have formulated an equation that the electron Green's function must satisfy.

| **[Finite temperatures and flat bands: the Hubbard model on three-dimensional Lieb lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16206v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate some thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on two three-dimensional extensions of the Lieb lattice: the perovskite Lieb lattice (PLL) and the layered Lieb lattice (LLL). Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations alongside Hartree-Fock and cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) approaches, we analyze how flat-band degeneracy, connectivity, and lattice anisotropy influence the emergence of magnetic order. Our results show that both geometries support finite-temperature magnetic transitions, namely ferromagnetic (FM) on the PLL, and antiferromagnetic (AFM) on the LLL. Further, we have established that the critical temperature, $T_c$, as a function of the uniform on-site coupling, $U$, displays a maximum, which is smaller in the AFM case than in the FM one, despite the absence of flat bands in the LLL. We also provide numerical evidence to show that flat bands in the PLL rapidly generate magnetic moments, but a small interorbital coordination suppresses the increase of $T_c$ at large interaction strength $U/t$. By contrast, the LLL benefits from higher connectivity, favoring magnetic order even in the absence of flat bands. The possibilities of anisotropic interlayer hoppings and inhomogeneous on-site interactions were separateley explored. We have found that magnetism in the PLL is hardly affected by hopping anisotropy, since the main driving mechanism is the preserved flat band; for the LLL, by contrast, spectral weight is removed from $d$-sites, which increases $T_c$ more significantly. At mean-field level, we have obtained that setting $U=0$ on $p$ sites and $U=U_d\neq0$ on $d$ sites leads to a quantum critical point at some $U_d$; this behavior was not confirmed by our DQMC simulations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

In this work, we investigate quantum phase transitions induced by an electric potential difference in a one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard chain. By analyzing (i) tunneling and pairing mechanisms, (ii) charge and spin gaps, and (iii) entanglement between the chain halves, we identify three distinct phases: Mott insulator, metal and band-like insulator. The metallic regime, characterized by the closing of both charge and spin gaps, is accompanied by a field-dependent kinetic energy and a quasi-periodic oscillatory behavior of pairing response and entanglement. Although the metallic phase persists for different magnetizations, its extent in the phase diagram shrinks as spin polarization increases.</p></details> |  |

We span the nonmagnetic sector from filling $n=4$, which is representative of undoped iron-based superconductors, to $n=3$, where a Mott insulating state with each orbital at half filling is found. In the strong-coupling regime, when the electron density is increased, we find a spontaneous differentiation between the occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, leading to an orbital-selective state with a nematic character that becomes stronger at increasing density. One of these orbitals stays half-filled for all densities while the other one hosts (together with the $d_{xy}$ orbital) the excess of electron density. Most importantly, in this regime long-range pairing correlations appear in the orbital with the largest occupation. Our results highlight a strong link between orbital-selective correlations, nematicity, and superconductivity, which requires the presence of a significant Hund's coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (inclusive of supplemental material), 4 figures in the main text, 5 figures in the supplemental material</p></details> |

Taking strong correlations into account carefully, we find a ferromagnetically ordered state, in which one of the three components becomes dominant, when holes are doped away from one-third filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this ferromagnetically ordered phase undergoes a first-order transition to a paramagnetic state. We clarify the stability of the ferromagnetically ordered state against interaction strength, hole doping, and temperatures. The relevance of generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism is also addressed, by comparing the results on the Bethe lattice.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09910v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid (NF). In contrast, the insulating phases that survive at high temperatures in the presence of disorder are the Bose glass and the normal fluid. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</p></details> |  |

The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</p></details> |  |

More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors. This work lays the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical investigations into the unique electronic properties of these emerging materials.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures and appendix</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incommensurate spin-fluctuations and competing pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05254v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K under I4/mmm space group. The susceptibility measurements confirm bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Our research provides a new platform for the investigation of the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in Ruddlesden-Popper trilayer perovskite nickelates.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity.

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

However, current ab initio approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe$_2$, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s-4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Harnessing their full potential requires understanding both intrinsic transport and the dynamics of optically excited spin and charge carriers -- particularly the transition between excited spin polarization and the conduction band's intrinsic spin texture. Here, we investigate the spin polarization of the conduction bands of bulk WSe$_2$ using static and time-resolved spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, complemented by photocurrent calculations. Electron doping reveals the intrinsic spin polarization, while time-resolved measurements trace the evolution of excited spin carriers. We find that intervalley scattering is spin-conserving, with spin transport initially governed by photoexcited carriers and aligning with the intrinsic conduction band polarization after $\sim$150 fs.</p></details> |  |

This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures.

We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.</p></details> |  |

The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

Here, we demonstrate that exposing WSe$_2$ to chloroform provides simple and stable p-type doping. In monolayer WSe$_2$ transistors with Pd contacts, chloroform increases the maximum hole current by over 100$\times$ (>200 $\mu$A/$\mu$m), reduces $R_\textrm{C}$ to ~2.5 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m, and retains an on/off ratio of $10^{10}$ at room temperature. These improvements persist for over 8 months, survive annealing above 150 {\deg}C, and remain effective down to 10 K, enabling a cryogenic $R_\textrm{C}$ of ~1 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Density functional theory indicates that chloroform strongly physisorbs to WSe$_2$, inducing hole doping with minimal impact on the electronic states between the valence band and conduction band edges. Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy reveal that chloroform intercalates at the WSe$_2$ interface with the gate oxide, contributing to doping stability and mitigating interfacial dielectric disorder. This robust, scalable approach enables high-yield WSe$_2$ transistors with good p-type performance.</p></details> |  |

However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Accompanying the superconductivity and a correlated insulator phase is the Kondo-lattice-like phenomenology in transport properties. Here we consider how such phenomenology can develop when the combination of the active bands are topological.

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11763v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band's natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters; 7 + 9 pages, 4 + 6 figures</p></details> |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript: 9 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Here, we theoretically investigate how the electronic states of the nanobubble QDs are influenced by the geometrical anisotropy of the elliptical-shape nanobubbles. We examine the energy levels of the single QD (SQD) and double QD (DQD) spectra by varying the elliptical deformation in the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively. We found that the SQD and DQD show distinguished behavior with respect to the direction of the elliptical deformation. While the SQD levels are substantially affected by the $y$-directional deformation, the DQD levels are largely shifted by the $x$-directional deformation.</p></details> |  |

Here, we report for the first time a physics-based compact model, which precisely describes the drain current (ID) fluctuations of monolayer GFETs. Physical mechanisms known to generate 1/f noise in transistors, such as carrier number and Coulomb scattering mobility fluctuations, are also revealed to cause ID variance. Such effects are considered in the model by being activated locally in the channel and the integration of their contributions from source to drain results in total variance. The proposed model is experimentally validated from a statistical population of three different-sized solution-gated (SG) GFETs from strong p- to strong n-type bias conditions. A series resistance ID variance model is also derived mainly contributing at high carrier densities.</p></details> |  |

Although Li-decorated irida-graphene (IG) has shown promising hydrogen storage potential, its capacity is limited to $\sim$ 7wt\%, which, despite exceeding the U.S. DOE target, remains inadequate for large-scale applications. Additionally, Li clustering over extended cycles may compromise adsorption efficiency and structural stability. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the hydrogen storage potential of IG decorated with superalkali OLi$_3$ clusters, aiming to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability for advanced hydrogen storage technologies. Our findings show that the OLi$_3$ clusters exhibit a significant binding energy of -3.24 eV, which highlights its strong interaction with the IG. OLi$_3$@IG complex can host up to 12H$_2$ molecules, with optimal maximum storage capacity of 10.00 wt\%. Additionally, the release temperature (T$_R$) and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate that H$_2$ molecules can be efficiently released at operating temperatures under ambient conditions. These results highlight the potential of OLi$_3$-decorated irida-graphene as a promising candidate for reversible hydrogen storage.</p></details> |  |

Strain engineering on graphene has been achieved via random nanobubbles or artificial nanostructures on the substrate, but the highly localized and non-uniform pseudomagnetic fields can make spectroscopic probes of electronic structure difficult. Heterostructure engineering offers an alternative approach: By stacking graphene on top of another van der Waals material with large lattice mismatch at a desired twist angle, it is possible to generate large strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields uniformly over the entire heterostructure. Here, we report using nano-angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano-ARPES) to probe the electronic bandstructure of a graphene/black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP). By directly measuring the iso-energy contours of graphene and black phosphorus we determine a twist angle of 20-degrees in our heterostructure. High-resolution nano-ARPES of the graphene bands near the Fermi level reveals the emergence of flat bands located within the Dirac cone. The spacing of the flat bands is consistent with Landau level formation in graphene, and corresponds to a pseudo-field of 11.36 T. Our work provides a new way to study quantum Hall phases induced by strain in 2D materials and heterostructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The results in this paper have turned out to be most likely incorrect and arose due to an instrument artefact rather than a real signal, and we have not been able to reproduce them.

It can lead to various anomalous transport phenomena such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects8-11. In general, the in-plane magnetic field B|| primarily couples to the spin degrees of freedom in graphene and has long been presumed to have a negligible effect on orbital magnetism due to the ultra-weak spin-orbit coupling12-18. In this work, we report multiple unconventional orbital magnetic phenomena that are highly sensitive to the B|| field in graphene/hBN superlattices hosting both integer and fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). We observed chirality-switching behaviors of the Chern insulator at moir\'e filling factor {\nu} = 1 under a finite B_par, demonstrating that both the C = +-1 states are permissible ground states at zero perpendicular magnetic field B_per. For the FCI at {\nu} = 2/3, we observed topological phase transitions between two states characterized by Hall resistivity \r{ho}xy = +-3h/2e2 under both B_per and B_par fields. In-plane B|| field can effectively suppress the FCI state at zero B_per field and enhance the FCI state with the opposite chirality, as resolved in Landau fan diagrams. Moreover, we observed rich phase transitions at 1 < {\nu} < 2, accompanied by intervalley coherence and anomalous Hall effects (AHE) that can be triggered by sweeping either B_per or B_par. Our work has unveiled new properties of orbital magnetism, providing a new knob for engineering various AHE in graphene.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

By achieving low and uniform carrier densities, we have accessed a new regime of strong charge localization that dramatically reduces thermal conductance, significantly enhancing bolometer performance. Here we present scalable graphene-based bolometers engineered for detecting GHz-range photons, a frequency domain essential for superconducting quantum processors. Our devices deliver a state-of-the-art noise equivalent power of 40 zW$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at $T=40~$mK, enabled by the steep temperature dependence of thermal conductance, $G_{\rm th}\sim T^4$ for $T<100~$mK.

This approach, originally due to Zwaan, bypasses the need for exact solutions at turning points, which are generally unavailable beyond linear or quadratic band structures. Applying this technique to biased bilayer graphene reveals non-standard features of the asymptotic wavefunctions, in particular the necessity of retaining decaying components even in classically allowed regions. By providing a fully analytic solution, this work complements and clarifies earlier results based on hybrid analytical-numerical treatments, and importantly establishes the absolute normalisation of the pair production rate -- and hence of the tunnelling current.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on helical trilayers near the magic angle and under a substrate potential, we demonstrate that an isolated higher Chern band with Chern number $|C_{band}|=2$ emerges, enabling the exploration of many-body states beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm. We use exact diagonalization to predict a rich phase diagram of gapped states unattainable in a single $|C_{band}|=1$ band. At filling $\nu=2/3$, we identify a quantum Hall crystal with integer Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=e^2/h$ coexisting with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge density wave order. At $\nu=1/2$, we find a quantum Hall pseudospin ferromagnet featuring extensive ground state degeneracy, Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=e^2/h$, and $2\times 2$ charge order. Finally, at $\nu=1/3$ we find a translation-symmetric fractional Chern insulator with $|\sigma_{H}|=2e^2/3h$. By incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we identify an optimal filling regime $\nu_{\rm{total}}=3+\nu$, where three flavors are fully filled, leaving the fourth at partial filling $\nu$. Notably, inter-flavor interactions renormalize the bandwidth and stabilize all the gapped phases even in realistic parameter regimes away from the chiral limit.</p></details> |  |

However, one frequently observes charge transfer on coinage metal substrates, which results in spinless closed-shell configurations. Using low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate here that pristine topologically nontrivial chiral graphene nanoribbons synthesized directly on the ferromagnet $\textrm{GdAu}_2$ can either maintain a charge-neutral diradical singlet or triplet configuration, or exist in a singly anionic doublet state. As an underlying mechanism, we identify a moir\'{e}-modulated work function and exchange field, as corroborated by Kelvin-probe force microscopy and spin-flip spectroscopy. The joint electrostatic and magnetic interactions allow reversibly switching between the three spin multiplicities by atomic manipulation. We introduce an effective Hubbard dimer model that unifies the effects of local electrostatic gating, electron-electron-correlation, hybridization and exchange field to outline the phase diagram of accessible spin states. Our results establish a platform for the local control of $\pi$-radicals adsorbed on metallic substrates.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

We developed an equivariant machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) with near-DFT accuracy to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pt crystal growth on graphene and subsequent H$_2$-sensing. MD simulations validated by TEM show that Pt deposition begins with dispersed nuclei coalescing into polycrystalline nanoclusters with predominantly FCC interiors, while both MD and Raman spectroscopy reveal a predominantly non-covalent Pt-graphene interaction that induces moderate local strain and charge transfer yet preserves graphene's structural integrity. Reactive MD simulations confirm H$_2$ dissociative chemisorption exclusively on Pt, with negligible spillover onto pristine graphene. However, H adsorption on Pt attenuates the Pt-graphene interfacial binding, providing an indirect electronic pathway for H$_2$ sensing. Transient and steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrate that an intermediate Pt loading minimizes the limit of detection; lower loadings facilitate faster response and recovery kinetics and enhance signal transduction, whereas higher loadings increase the doping level of graphene. DFT charge analysis indicates that under-coordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, whereas continuous Pt films induce $p$-type doping, with both effects attenuated upon H adsorption. The developed machine-learned MD framework enables quantum-mechanically accurate modeling of metal crystal growth on graphene, elucidates the underlying H$_2$-sensing mechanism, and correlates several key sensing figures of merit with metal loading and morphology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation of giant nonlinear Hall conductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11156v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 + 2 figures in Main text; 89 pages, 19 figures in SI.

These findings bring into focus the role of the electronic Bloch wavefunction and the quantum geometric tensor in determining the superconducting pairing channel. In this work, we examine superconducting instabilities of a model of $N$-layer rhombohedral graphene that possesses an enhanced Berry curvature distribution on an extended ring in momentum space $-$ that we dub the 'Berry-ring of fire' $-$ in the presence of an isotropic attractive interaction with a parametrically controlled spatial range. We determine that local interactions favor a $N$-fold winding in the order parameter phase for odd-$N$ layered systems, with even-$N$ layers requiring a spatially extended attraction range to achieve pairing. For generic interaction lengths, we discover a family of chiral superconductors and, remarkably, momentum-space vortices nucleated on the Berry-ring of fire. The existence of these vortices can be traced to a momentum-space flux quantization condition involving the Berry curvature, with the phase winding dictated by a combination of the Berry flux and a 'statistical flux' to enforce Fermi-Dirac statistics. Such an order parameter structure allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning between various chiral superconducting phases through changes in the electron density or the displacement field. We discuss ways in which these predictions can be experimentally tested and potentially exploited in future devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 + ...</summary><p>10 + 5 pages, 7 + 5 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we demonstrate that graphene, when influenced by carrier-dependent trapping in the hBN spacer triggered by a localized potential from Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), can exhibit valley transistor behavior under specific conditions. We employ a tight-binding model that self-consistently incorporates a Gaussian-shaped potential to represent the effect of the tip gate. Crucially, we show that the heterostructure functions as a field-effect transistor (FET), with its operation governed by the bias gate (shifting the Fermi level) and the tip-induced potential (breaking electron-hole symmetry via selective trapping of electron or hole quasiparticles). Our results reveal that, under specific lattice geometry, pulse frequency, and gate voltage conditions, the device exhibits valley transistor functionality. The valley current (e.g., I_K1=-K or I_K2=+K) can be selectively controlled by synchronizing the frequencies and polarities of the tip and bias gate voltages. Notably, when both gates are driven with the same polarity, the graphene channel outputs a periodically modulated, pure valley-polarized current. This enables switching between distinct ON/OFF valley current states even at finite bias. Remarkably, when the I_K1=-K current is ON (forward current), the I_K2=+K current is OFF. Reversing the gate polarity inverts this behavior: I_K1=-K turns OFF, while I_K2=+K turns ON (reverse current). These findings pave the way toward low-voltage valley transistors in metal-insulator-semiconductor architectures, offering new avenues for valleytronics and advanced gating technologies.</p></details> |  |

We establish an approximate equivalence between post-selection and arbitrary non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Namely, first we establish hardness in the following sense: Let $U=e^{-iHt}$ be an NH gate on $n$ qubits whose smallest and largest singular values differ by at least $2^{-\text{poly}(n)}$. Together with any universal set of unitary gates, the ability to apply such a gate lets one efficiently emulate postselection. The resulting model decides every language in PostBQP; hence, under standard complexity conjectures, fully scalable NH quantum computers are unlikely to be engineered. Second, we establish upper bounds which show that conversely, any non-Hermitian evolution can be written as a unitary on a system-meter pair followed by postselecting the meter. This ``purification'' is compact -- it introduces only $O(\delta^{2})$ Trotter error per time step $\delta$ -- so any NH model whose purification lies in a strongly simulable unitary family (e.g., Clifford, matchgate, or low-bond-dimension tensor-network circuits) remains efficiently simulable. Thus, non-Hermitian physics neither guarantees a quantum advantage nor precludes efficient classical simulation: its complexity is controlled by the singular-value radius of the evolution operator and by the structure of its unitary purification.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 + ...</summary><p>11 + 3 pages, comments welcome</p></details> |

Here, we develop a theory for the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) response of altermagnetic Mott insulators. Crucially, the spectrum does not simply reflect the non-interacting band structure, but instead a magnetic polaron is formed at low energies, that can be interpreted as a spinon-holon bound state. We develop a spinon-holon parton theory and predict a renormalized bandwidth that we confirm by tensor network simulations. We analyze the characteristic spin-split spectrum and identify a spin-dependent spectral weight of the magnetic polaron, resulting from the altermagnetic symmetry. Our work paves the way for a systematic study of doping effects and correlation phenomena in altermagnetic Mott insulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

Here, we construct a realistic moir\'e lattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and filling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized Wigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moir\'e unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+11...</summary><p>12+11 pages, 6+10 figures</p></details> |

Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Learning Circuits with Infinite Tensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02105v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamiltonian simulation on quantum computers is strongly constrained by gate counts, motivating techniques to reduce circuit depths. While tensor networks are natural competitors to quantum computers, we instead leverage them to support circuit design, with datasets of tensor networks enabling a unitary synthesis inspired by quantum machine learning. For a target simulation in the thermodynamic limit, translation invariance is exploited to significantly reduce the optimization complexity, avoiding a scaling with system size. Our approach finds circuits to efficiently prepare ground states, and perform time evolution on both infinite and finite systems with substantially lower gate depths than conventional Trotterized methods. In addition to reducing CNOT depths, we motivate similar utility for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, with a demonstrated $5.2\times$ reduction in $T$-count to realize $e^{-iHt}$. The key output of our approach is the optimized unit-cell of a translation invariant circuit. This provides an advantage for Hamiltonian simulation of finite, yet arbitrarily large, systems on real quantum computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[2D Entanglement from a Single Motzkin Spaghetto](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02103v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their 2D counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least 4 neighboring degrees of freedom. In this letter, a 2D lattice system interacting only between two nearest neighboring sites is proposed, which has a unique ground state with volume scaling of entanglement entropy. The system undergoes an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous construction from coupling orthogonal arrays of one-dimensional chains, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. A tensor network representation is composed of tensors with lower rank, and has a similar global geometry.</p></details> |  |

In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</p></details> | <details><summary>25+13...</summary><p>25+13 pages, 5 tables, 6 figures, data in ancillary files</p></details> |

We implement our state preparation protocol on ion-trap hardware with added noise to demonstrate the threshold behavior in a real quantum device.

We apply this simulation to a near-optimized iteration of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a transverse field Ising model in order to investigate the influence of large system sizes on the performance of the algorithm. We find that while circuits with a large number of qubits fail more often under noise that depletes the qubit population, their outputs on a successful measurement are just as robust under Rydberg atom dissipation or qubit dephasing as smaller systems. However, such circuits might not perform as well under coherent multi-qubit errors such as Rydberg atom crosstalk. We also find that the optimized parameters are especially robust to noise, suggesting that a noisier quantum system can be used to find the optimal parameters before switching to a cleaner system for measurements of observables.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

Far from usual models of decoherence, nearly all quantum devices are plagued both by a continuum of environments and temporal instabilities. These induce noisy quantum and classical correlations at the level of the circuit. The relevant spatiotemporal effects are difficult enough to understand, let alone combat. There is presently a lack of either scalable or complete methods to address the phenomena responsible for scrambling and loss of quantum information. Here, we make deep strides to remedy this problem. We establish a theoretical framework that uniformly incorporates and classifies all non-Markovian phenomena. Our framework is universal, assumes no parameters values, and is written entirely in terms of experimentally accessible circuit-level quantities. We formulate an efficient reconstruction using tensor network learning, allowing also for easy modularisation and simplification based on the expected physics of the system. This is then demonstrated through both extensive numerical studies and implementations on IBM Quantum devices, estimating a comprehensive set of spacetime correlations. Finally, we conclude our analysis with applications thereof to the efficacy of control techniques to counteract these effects -- including noise-aware circuit compilation and optimised dynamical decoupling. We find significant improvements are possible in the diamond norm and average gate fidelity of arbitrary $SU(4)$ operations, as well as related decoupling improvements in contrast to off-the-shelf schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 15 figures + 7 page appendix.

One method that has gained attention for performing this evaluation on classical computers is tensor networks. Tensor networks not only reduce the computational cost required for simulations by using approximations but are also deeply connected to entanglement. Entanglement is one of the most important elements for the quantum advantages of quantum algorithms, but the direct relationship between quantum advantages and entanglement remains largely unexplored. Tensor networks are promising as a means to address this question. In this study, we focus on the entanglement in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This study aims to investigate entanglement in QAOA by examining the relationship between the approximation rates of tensor networks and the performance of QAOA. Specifically, we actually perform tensor network simulations of QAOA on a classical computer and extend the study of the scaling relations presented in previous research. We have discovered that scaling relations hold even when entanglement entropy is used as the vertical axis. Furthermore, by analyzing the results of the numerical calculations, we propose a new function for the scaling relation. Additionally, we discovered interesting relationships regarding the behavior of entanglement in QAOA during our analysis. This research is expected to provide new insights into the theoretical foundation of the scaling relations presented in previous studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The circuit parameters are optimized to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, using only single- and two-qubit expectation values. This significantly reduces the measurement overhead by avoiding full energy evaluation. By updating the initial state based on results from last step iteratively, the algorithm quickly converges to the low-energy solutions. With a pre-sorting step that optimizes quantum gate ordering based on QUBO coefficients, the convergence is further improved. Our classical simulations achieve approximation ratios above 0.99 up to 150 qubits. Furthermore, the linear scaling of entanglement entropy with system size suggests that the circuit is challenging to simulate classically using tensor networks. We also demonstrate hardware runs on IBM's device for 40, 60, and 80 qubits, and obtain solutions compatible with that from simulated annealing.</p></details> |  |

The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 + 7...</summary><p>8 + 7 pages; 6 + 6 figures</p></details> |

Inspired by tensor network models and the earlier concept of bit threads, we propose rules governing the trajectories of entanglement threads in the holographic bulk. These rules not only carry meaningful interpretations at the level of quantum information theory but also determine that the entanglement threads travel along geodesics in the holographic bulk. This makes kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing holographic entanglement thread configurations. We hope that the holographic entanglement thread method can provide necessary constraints or useful guidance for constructing genuine holographic tensor networks beyond toy models.</p></details> | 56 pages, 18 figures |

Here, we present a novel tensor network approach that reformulates the high-dimensional configurational integral for identical-particle crystals into a sequence of computationally efficient summations. We represent the integrand as a high-dimensional tensor and apply tensor-train (TT) decomposition together with a custom TT-cross interpolation scheme. This approach avoids the need to explicitly construct the full tensor, which would otherwise be computationally intractable. We introduce tailored rank-1 and rank-2 schemes optimized for sharply peaked Boltzmann probability densities, typical in crystalline solids. When applied to the calculation of internal energy and pressure-temperature curves for crystalline copper (Cu) and argon (Ar), as well as the alpha-to-beta phase transition in tin (Sn), our method accurately reproduces molecular dynamics simulation results using tight-binding, machine learning (HIP-NN), and MEAM potentials, all within seconds of computation time.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we consider the Gaussian random displacement channel $N_{\sigma}$, a type of bosonic Gaussian channels relevant in various bosonic quantum information processing systems. In particular, we attempt to make progress on the problem of determining the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random displacement channel by analyzing the error-correction performance of several families of multi-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. In doing so we analyze the surface-square GKP codes using an efficient and exact maximum likelihood decoder (MLD) up to a large code distance of $d=39$. We find that the error threshold of the surface-square GKP code is remarkably close to $\sigma=1/\sqrt{e}\simeq 0.6065$ at which the best-known lower bound of the quantum capacity of $N_{\sigma}$ vanishes. We also analyze the performance of color-hexagonal GKP codes up to a code distance of $d=13$ using a tensor-network decoder serving as an approximate MLD. By focusing on multi-mode GKP codes that encode just one logical qubit over multiple bosonic modes, we show that GKP codes can achieve non-zero quantum state transmission rates for a Gaussian random displacement channel $N_{\sigma}$ at larger values of $\sigma$ than previously demonstrated. Thus our work reduces the gap between the quantum communication theoretic bounds and the performance of explicit bosonic quantum error-correcting codes in regards to the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random displacement channel.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.4 +...</summary><p>4.4 + 11.1 pages, 3+4 figures.

Commun. 16, 96 (2025)]. Using this approach, we study the multipartite entanglement of the quantum Ising model in 1d, 2d, and 3d. We first obtain the full reduced density matrix (tomography) of subregions that have at most 4 sites via quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and the exact solution in 1d. We then analyze both bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) among the sites in the subregion. To do so, we use a variety of measures including the negativity, as well as a true measure of GME: the genuinely multipartite concurrence (or GME concurrence), and its computationally cheaper lower bound, $I_2$. We provide a complete proof that $I_2$ bounds the GME concurrence, and show how the symmetries of the state simplify its evaluation. For adjacent sites, we find 3- and 4-spin GME present across large portions of the phase diagram, reaching maximum near the quantum critical point. In 1d, we identify the singular scaling of the derivative $dI_2/dh$ approaching the critical point. We observe a sharp decrease of GME with increasing dimensionality, coherent with the monogamous nature of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that GME disappears for subregions consisting of non-adjacent sites in both 2d and 3d, offering a stark illustration of the short-ranged nature of entanglement in equilibrium quantum matter arXiv:2402.06677. Finally, we analyze the most collective form of entanglement by evaluating the GME concurrence among all spins in the lattice, which can be obtained from a simple observable: the single-site transverse magnetization. This global concurrence is larger in 1d compared to 2d/3d, but it is relatively less robust against perturbations such as local measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+8 ...</summary><p>12+8 pages, 7+7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic structure factor of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with long-range interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15168v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as a ``model selection'' tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</p></details> | 23 pages, 29 figures |

Through systematic analysis of one-dimensional model systems, we evaluate their computational efficiency and representational power against established methods. Our numerical experiments suggest some efficient training methods and we explore how the computational cost scales with desired precision, particle number, and system parameters. Roughly speaking, KANs seem to be 10 times cheaper computationally than other neural network based ansatz. We also introduce a novel approach for handling strong short-range potentials-a persistent challenge for many numerical techniques-which generalizes efficiently to higher-dimensional, physically relevant systems with short-ranged strong potentials common in atomic and nuclear physics.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

By employing the numerically exact determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we mimic the effects of experimental Ca vacancy by an external local potential to investigate the charge and spectral properties of the system hosting two doped holes. The model numerically support the role of the $4\times4$ supercell as the building block of hole doped cuprates via the hole density distribution and local spectra around the local potential. Our results might provide a theoretical support on the experimental observations and a platform for investigating local charge order and local Cooper pairs on the $4\times4$ supercell as the plausible route to understanding unconventional cuprate superconductivity.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00126v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Variation of Bose surface by Filling in Cooper pair Bose metal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24405v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) is a non-superfluid quantum phase in which uncondensed fermion pairs form a "Bose surface" in momentum space. We investigate the CPBM in the two-dimensional spin-anisotropic attractive Hubbard model by tuning the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping t', carrier filling n, and spin anisotropy alpha, using large-scale constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations. A moderate NNN hopping (t'/t = 0.2) substantially enlarges the CPBM region: the phase extends into weaker anisotropy regimes and coexists with a commensurate charge-density wave (CDW) near half-filling (n > 0.95), where CDW order would otherwise dominate at t' = 0. Interestingly, t' suppresses the overall CDW peak amplitude and introduces a geometric correlation between the orientations of the Fermi and Bose surfaces: for weak Fermi-surface rotations, the Bose surface remains aligned with the lattice axes, while larger distortions drive both surfaces to rotate in tandem. Momentum-resolved pairing distributions reveal that the bosonic pairing channels are jointly controlled by t' and carrier filling n. For small t', d_xy-wave correlations dominate across the entire filling range. In contrast, for larger t', the dominant pairing symmetry varies with n, reflecting a nontrivial interplay between frustration and density. These findings establish carrier filling and NNN hopping as complementary levers for manipulating CPBM stability and provide concrete criteria for identifying non-superfluid bosonic matter in cold-atom and correlated-electron systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures, |
| **[Group Convolutional Neural Network Ground State of the Quantum Dimer Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23728v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We estimate the ground state of the square lattice Quantum Dimer Model in a $\rm{p4m}$-symmetric Group Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) representation and show that results in agreement with exact diagonalization (ED) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can be obtained with a $\mathcal{L}=2$ layer network. In systems of linear size $L=8$ with Hilbert space dimension $3.1\times 10^8$, GCNN shows fidelity as high as $0.99999$ with ED. For $12\leq L\leq 32$, we find excellent agreement with QMC estimates of energy, order parameters and correlation functions. The network is optimized by minimizing the energy estimated from a Metropolis algorithm assisted by a directed loop sampler. We analyze the quantum geometric tensor at the minima for $\mathcal{L}=1,2$ and $3$ and show that the empirical quantum dimension saturates with increasing network complexity due to Metropolis sampling constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dividing quantum circuits for time evolution of stochastic processes by orthogonal series density estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01889v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Monte Carlo integration (QMCI) is a quantum algorithm to estimate expectations of random variables, with applications in various industrial fields such as financial derivative pricing. When QMCI is applied to expectations concerning a stochastic process $X(t)$, e.g., an underlying asset price in derivative pricing, the quantum circuit $U_{X(t)}$ to generate the quantum state encoding the probability density of $X(t)$ can have a large depth. With time discretized into $N$ points, using state preparation oracles for the transition probabilities of $X(t)$, the state preparation for $X(t)$ results in a depth of $O(N)$, which may be problematic for large $N$. Moreover, if we estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ at $N$ time points, the total query complexity scales on $N$ as $O(N^2)$, which is worse than the $O(N)$ complexity in the classical Monte Carlo method. In this paper, to improve this, we propose a method to divide $U_{X(t)}$ based on orthogonal series density estimation. This approach involves approximating the densities of $X(t)$ at $N$ time points with orthogonal series, where the coefficients are estimated as expectations of the orthogonal functions by QMCI. By using these approximated densities, we can estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ by QMCI without requiring deep circuits. Our error and complexity analysis shows that to obtain the approximated densities at $N$ time points, our method achieves the circuit depth and total query complexity scaling as $O(\sqrt{N})$ and $O(N^{3/2})$, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Hamiltonian Problem with succinct ground state is MA-Complete](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10155v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding the ground energy of a quantum system is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. Existing classical algorithms for tackling this problem often assume that the ground state has a succinct classical description, i.e. a poly-size classical circuit for computing the amplitude. Notable examples of succinct states encompass matrix product states, contractible projected entangled pair states, and states that can be represented by classical neural networks. We study the complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem with succinct ground state. We prove this problem is MA-Complete. The Hamiltonian we consider is general and might not be stoquastic. The MA verification protocol is based on the fixed node quantum Monte Carlo method, particularly the variant of the continuous-time Markov chain introduced by Bravyi et.al. [BCGL22]. Based on our work, we also introduce a notion of strong guided states, and conjecture that the local Hamiltonian problem with strong guided state is MA-Complete, which will be in contrast with the QCMA-Complete result of the local Hamiltonian problem with standard guided states [WFC23,GLG22].</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages; correct an error in Sec IV C.

With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+6 figures</p></details> |

Our solution, benchmarked against path-integral quantum Monte Carlo calculations, reveals significant corrections to the excitation spectrum and thermodynamic properties, previously overlooked by the standard excluded-volume approach. We also show that the hard rod model exhibits Luttinger liquid behavior across a wide range of parameters, at zero and finite temperature, as unveiled by correlation functions. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding strongly correlated regimes in dilute 1D systems, with applications to quantum wires, spin chains, and ultracold atoms.</p></details> |  |

Gilardoni {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, L161106 (2022)] to distinguish trivial, weak-, and strong-topological insulators in three dimensions, in presence of the inversion symmetry. The marker is written in term of ground-state expectation values of position operators and can be employed to detect topological phases of interacting systems beyond mean-field approximations, e.g., within quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Here, we show that the correct results of the non-interacting limit is reproduced by the many-body marker.</p></details> | 8 pages and 1 figure |
| **[Implementing advanced trial wave functions in fermion quantum Monte Carlo via stochastic sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18519v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an efficient approach to implement correlated many-body trial wave functions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). To control the sign/phase problem in AFQMC, a constraint is derived from an exact gauge condition but is typically imposed approximately through a trial wave function or trial density matrix, whose quality can affect the accuracy of the method. Furthermore, the trial wave function can also affect the efficiency through importance sampling. The most natural form of the trial wave function has been single Slater determinants or their linear combinations. More sophisticated forms, for example, with the inclusion of a Jastrow factor or other explicit correlations, have been challenging to use and their implementation is often assumed to require a quantum computer. In this work, we demonstrate that a large class of correlated wave functions, written in the general form of multi-dimensional integrals over hidden or auxiliary variables times Slater determinants, can be implemented as trial wave function by coupling the random walkers to a generalized Metropolis sampling. We discuss the fidelity of AFQMC with stochastically sampled trial wave functions, which are relevant to both quantum and classical algorithms. We illustrate the method and show that an efficient implementation can be achieved which preserves the low-polynomial computational scaling of AFQMC. We test our method in molecules under bond stretching and in transition metal diatomics. Significant improvements are seen in both accuracy and efficiency over typical trial wave functions, and the method yields total ground-state energies systematically within chemical accuracy. The method can be useful for incorporating other advanced wave functions, for example, neural quantum state wave functions optimized from machine learning techniques, or for other forms of fermion quantum Monte Carlo.</p></details> |  |

In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines and those enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |

We obtain exact results for the order parameter distribution function that compare well to the quantum Monte Carlo data. Furthermore, based on a detailed finite-size analysis, we provide evidence that the thermal melting transition at the SU(3) point is either weakly first-order in this system or, if continuous, it falls beyond the unitary-bounds of conformal field theory.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08397v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In this study, we establish the {\it condensate fraction} as a highly effective tool to achieve that and accordingly propose efficient schemes for accurately determining the transitions, via numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Using the 2D attractive Fermi-Hubbard model as a testbed, we access unprecedented system sizes (up to 4096 lattice sites) and perform a comprehensive analysis for the temperature dependence and finite-size scaling of {\it condensate fraction} across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We demonstrate that this quantity exhibits algebraic scaling below the transition and exponential scaling above it, with significantly smaller finite-size effect comparing to the extensively studied on-site pairing correlator. This greatly improves the determination of BKT transition with moderate system sizes. We also extract the finite-size BKT transition temperature from condensate fraction, and confirm its logarithmic correction on system size. Furthermore, we find that the specific heat displays an anomaly, showing a peak at a temperature slightly above BKT transition. Our findings should be generally applicable to 2D fermionic and bosonic systems hosting superconductivity or superfluidity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures; Supplementary Material</p></details> |
| **[Finite temperatures and flat bands: the Hubbard model on three-dimensional Lieb lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16206v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate some thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on two three-dimensional extensions of the Lieb lattice: the perovskite Lieb lattice (PLL) and the layered Lieb lattice (LLL). Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations alongside Hartree-Fock and cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) approaches, we analyze how flat-band degeneracy, connectivity, and lattice anisotropy influence the emergence of magnetic order. Our results show that both geometries support finite-temperature magnetic transitions, namely ferromagnetic (FM) on the PLL, and antiferromagnetic (AFM) on the LLL. Further, we have established that the critical temperature, $T_c$, as a function of the uniform on-site coupling, $U$, displays a maximum, which is smaller in the AFM case than in the FM one, despite the absence of flat bands in the LLL. We also provide numerical evidence to show that flat bands in the PLL rapidly generate magnetic moments, but a small interorbital coordination suppresses the increase of $T_c$ at large interaction strength $U/t$. By contrast, the LLL benefits from higher connectivity, favoring magnetic order even in the absence of flat bands. The possibilities of anisotropic interlayer hoppings and inhomogeneous on-site interactions were separateley explored. We have found that magnetism in the PLL is hardly affected by hopping anisotropy, since the main driving mechanism is the preserved flat band; for the LLL, by contrast, spectral weight is removed from $d$-sites, which increases $T_c$ more significantly. At mean-field level, we have obtained that setting $U=0$ on $p$ sites and $U=U_d\neq0$ on $d$ sites leads to a quantum critical point at some $U_d$; this behavior was not confirmed by our DQMC simulations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

This field has recently become one of the most prominent and active areas of research that connects the communities of chemistry and quantum optics. The ab initio modeling of such polaritonic phenomena has led to updating commonly used electronic structure methods, such as Hartree-Fock, density functional, and coupled cluster theories, to explicitly include Bosonic degrees of freedom. In this work, we explore the quantum electrodynamic auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QED-AFQMC) method to accurately capture the polaritonic ground state of representative quantum chemical benchmark systems to explore electron-photon correlations. We analyze these correlations across multiple examples and benchmark the QED-AFQMC results against other ab initio quantum electrodynamics methods, including QED-coupled cluster and QED-full configuration interaction, demonstrating the method's accuracy and its potential for scalable simulations of strongly coupled light-matter systems.</p></details> |  |

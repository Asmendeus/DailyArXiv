| **[Pressure-Induced Changes in Structure, Magnetic Order and Development of Superconductivity in the Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi8Te13](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15667v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Multiple Quasiparticle Bound States in a Trap Created by a Local Superconducting Gap Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15580v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At low temperature, the concentration of quasiparticles observed in superconducting circuits far exceeds the predictions of microscopic BCS theory at equilibrium. As a source of dissipation, these excess quasiparticles degrade the performance of various devices. Therefore, understanding their dynamics, especially their recombination into Cooper pairs, is an active topic of current research. In disordered superconductors, spatial fluctuations in the superconducting gap can trap quasiparticles and modify their eigenspectrum. Since this spectrum plays a key role in quasiparticle dynamics, it must be carefully investigated. To this end, we introduce a toy model of a single trap. Specifically, we consider a shallow disk-shaped gap variation in a clean superconductor. Using a semiclassical approximation, we demonstrate the existence of multiple bound states and give the dependence of their number on the size and depth of the gap suppression. Extending our analysis beyond the semiclassical regime, in dimensions larger than one, we observe an infinite number of bound states very close to the gap edge, even for an arbitrarily small trap. These results deepen our understanding of trapped quasiparticles and may have important implications for their recombination in disordered superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconducting Diode Effect due to Chiral Meissner Currents in a Hollow Superconducting Helix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15304v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a key nonreciprocal phenomenon with broad relevance for superconducting electronics. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations, we predict and quantify a superconducting diode effect arising solely from geometric chirality imposed to a conventional superconductor. The helical geometry and magnetic-field-induced screening currents produce inequivalent critical currents for opposite polarities. The diode efficiency reaches a maximum when one current direction first nucleates vortices, revealing a chirality-controlled crossover between screening- and vortex-dominated nonreciprocity. These results establish mesoscopic geometric chirality as a robust mechanism for supercurrent rectification in an achiral superconductor. They suggest an experimentally accessible route towards 3D superconducting diodes for multi-level integrated quantum circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conventional $s$-wave Superconductivity in LaRh$_2$As$_2$; the Analog without the 4$f$ Electrons of CeRh$_2$As$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15300v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductor LaRh$_2$As$_2$ has the same crystal structures as CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which exhibits superconducting (SC) multiphase in the $c$-axis magnetic field. Although the SC transition temperatures $T_c$ are similar, around 0.3 K, LaRh$_2$As$_2$ shows conventional type-II superconductivity with a small upper critical field $H_{c2}\sim$ 10 mT. At present, the SC properties of LaRh$_2$As$_2$ have not been clarified yet. We performed $^{75}$As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on LaRh$_2$As$_2$ to investigate the SC properties and gap structure. $1/T_1$ shows a clear coherence peak just below $T_c$ and an exponential decrease at lower temperatures, suggesting full-gap $s$-wave superconductivity. The numerical calculations based on an $s$-wave SC model reveal an SC gap size of $Δ(0)/k_{B}T_{c} \sim 1.48$, consistent with the weak-coupling $s$-wave superconductivity. These results suggest that the 4$f$ electrons in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ not only enhance the orbital limiting field but also contribute to the formation of unconventional superconductivity with SC multiphase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evidence for unexpectedly low quasiparticle generation rates across Josephson junctions of driven superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22930v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs) of superconducting qubits (SCQs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing (FTSQC). Nonetheless, quantitative experimental estimation on QPG rates has remained vague. Here, we investigate QPG using strongly driven SCQs, reaching qubit drive amplitudes up to $2π\times$300 GHz by applying intense drive fields through the readout resonators. The resonator nonlinear responses enable quantification of the energy loss at SCQs, including the contribution from QPG. Surprisingly, the estimated total energy loss rates are far lower than those expected by the Floquet-Markov formalism with QPG as the sole loss mechanism. Meanwhile, calculations that incorporate high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) in the QPG conductance at approximately 17-20 GHz effectively explain the experimental observations. These results suggest limitations in either the QPG conductance model or the Markovian treatment of the QPG processes. Both possibilities possess crucial implications for handling QPG problems toward FTSQC and for a more deeper understanding of Josephson junctions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been revised, and Supplementary Information has been added</p></details> |
| **[Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12988v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an SU(2)xU(1) genralization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary charge current and the spin current of the magnons), and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coherent transfer via parametric control of normal-mode splitting in a superconducting multimode resonator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15087v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microwave storage and retrieval are essential capabilities for superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip multimode resonator in which strong parametric modulation induces a large and tunable normal-mode splitting that enables microwave storage. When the spectral bandwidth of a short microwave pulse covers the two dressed-state absorption peaks, part of the pulse is absorbed and undergoes coherent energy exchange between the modes, producing a clear time-domain beating signal. By switching off the modulation before the beating arrives, we realize on-demand storage and retrieval, demonstrating an alternative approach to microwave photonic quantum memory. This parametric-normal-mode-splitting protocol offers a practical route toward a controllable quantum-memory mechanism in superconducting circuits.</p></details> | 4 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Pair-density-wave superconductivity and Anderson's theorem in bilayer nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15023v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Technologies for Scalable Superconducting Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15001v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experiments with superconducting quantum processors have successfully demonstrated the basic functions needed for quantum computation and evidence of utility, albeit without a sizable array of error-corrected qubits. The realization of the full potential of quantum computing centers on achieving large scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. Science, engineering and industry advances are needed to robustly generate, sustain, and efficiently manipulate an exponentially large computational (Hilbert) space as well as supply the number and quality components needed for such a scaled system. In this article, we suggest critical areas of quantum system and ecosystem development, with respect to the handling and transmission of quantum information within and out of a cryogenic environment, that would accelerate the development of quantum computers based on superconducting circuits.</p></details> | 23 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02429v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[High efficiency superconducting diode effect in a gate-tunable double-loop SQUID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14909v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), the superconducting diode effect may be generated by interference of multiple harmonic components in the current-phase relationships (CPRs) of different branches forming SQUID loops. Through the inclusion of two gate-tunable Josephson junctions in series in each interference branch of a double-loop SQUID, we demonstrate independent control over both the harmonic content and the amplitude of three interfering CPRs, facilitating significant improvement in the maximum diode efficiency. Through optimized gate-controlled tuning of individual Josephson energies, diode efficiency exceeding 50% is demonstrated. Flux-dependent oscillations show quantitative agreement with a simple model of SQUID operation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Spin-fluctuation-mediated chiral $d+id'$-wave superconductivity in the $α$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice with an incipient flat band](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14379v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study anisotropic superconductivity in the nearly quarter-filled $α$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice. We analyze an extended Hubbard model with off-site attractive interactions within the mean-field framework and find two distinct chiral $d+id'$-wave superconducting phases characterized by different Chern numbers. We further investigate the superconducting mechanism mediated by spin fluctuations arising from purely repulsive interactions by applying the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation to the Hubbard model. The gap symmetry obtained by solving the linearized Eliashberg equation is $d$-wave, which corresponds to a $d+id'$-wave superconducting state with a Chern number of $8$, including the spin degree of freedom. The $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{0}$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation, which possesses the largest spectral weight at finite energies arising from the incipient flat band, gives rise to an effective spin-singlet pairing glue between rim sites.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Muon Knight shift as a precise probe of the superconducting symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14107v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Muon spin rotation ($μ$SR) measurements of internal magnetic field shifts, known as the muon Knight shift, is used for determining pairing symmetries in superconductors. While this technique has been especially effective for $f$-electron-based heavy-fermion superconductors, it remains challenging in $d$-electron-based superconductors such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where the Knight shift is intrinsically small. Here, we report high-precision muon Knight shift measurements of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We observe that using multiple pieces of crystals, a common practice in $μ$SR measurements, induces a substantial paramagnetic shift below the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, when a weak magnetic field is applied. We attribute such an unresolved paramagnetic shift to stray fields generated by neighboring diamagnetic crystals. To avoid this, one piece of crystal was used in this study. We experimentally determine the muon Knight shift of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the normal state to be -116$\pm$7 ppm. By combining the observed muon Knight shift with independently determined bulk magnetization data from the same crystal used in $μ$SR and carefully separating various contributions to the shift, we confirm a significant reduction in the spin Knight shift below $T_c$, consistent with spin-singlet-like pairing. This result constitutes the precise muon Knight shift measurement in a $d$-electron-based superconductor. Our results highlight the potential of $μ$SR as a powerful complementary technique to the established method of nuclear magnetic resonance for probing the spin susceptibility in superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magic state cultivation on a superconducting quantum processor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13908v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires a universal gate set, but the necessary non-Clifford gates represent a significant resource cost for most quantum error correction architectures. Magic state cultivation offers an efficient alternative to resource-intensive distillation protocols; however, testing the proposal's assumptions represents a challenging departure from quantum memory experiments. We present an experimental study of magic state cultivation on a superconducting quantum processor. We implement cultivation, including code-switching into a surface code, and develop a fault-tolerant measurement protocol to bound the magic state fidelity. Cultivation reduces the error by a factor of 40, with a state fidelity of 0.9999(1) (retaining 8% of attempts). Our results experimentally establish magic state cultivation as a viable solution to one of quantum computing's most significant challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Field-angle-resolved heat transport in UTe$_2$: determination of nodal positions in the superconducting order parameter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13877v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the recurring hurdles in studying unconventional superconductivity is the challenge of efficiently and conclusively identifying the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in a new material. Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures (including SI)</p></details> |
| **[Chiral topological superconductivity in hole-doped Sn/Si(111)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13808v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A third monolayer of tin atoms on the semiconductor substrate Si(111) has been shown to become superconducting upon six to ten percent hole doping. Experiments have reported promising results hinting at a superconducting chiral $d$-wave order parameter. Here we examine Sn/Si(111) by combining most recent ab initio results, quasi-particle interference calculations, state-of-the-art truncated-unity functional renormalization group simulations and Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis. We show remarkable agreement between experimental and theoretical quasi-particle interference data both in the metallic and superconducting regimes. The interacting phase diagram reveals that the superconductivity is indeed chiral $d$-wave with Chern number $C=4$. Surprisingly, magnetically ordered phases are absent, instead we find charge density wave order, as observed in related compounds, as a competing phase. Our results demonstrate that Sn/Si(111) is an outstanding candidate material for chiral topological superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>(7+8 ...</summary><p>(7+8 pages, 4+5 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13793v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ necessitates a minimal theoretical model that unifies the superconducting phase with the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase without external pressure or strain. We propose a model where half-filled $d_{z^{2}}$ local moments interact with itinerant $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ electrons via strong Hund's coupling $J_H$, which reduces to a bilayer type-II t-J model in the large $J_H$ limit. Using iDMRG calculations on an $L_y=4, L_z=2$ cylinder, we demonstrate that the competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange generates period-4 stripe-like SDW order-a feature absent in one-orbital t-J model with only $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Furthermore, increasing the interlayer exchange coupling suppresses magnetic order and stabilizes interlayer s-wave superconductivity. These results identify the type-II t-J model as a minimal framework for capturing the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Nonreciprocal Transport in chiral Mo3Al2C Near the Superconducting to Normal Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13601v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate nonreciprocal electrical transport in bulk single-crystalline Mo3Al2C, a material known to host crystallographic chirality, a polar charge-density-wave instability, and a superconducting transition near 8 K. Using AC transport measurements to analyze the first-harmonic and second-harmonic resistance responses, we observe a distinct nonreciprocal second-harmonic signal that is significantly enhanced near the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases. Phenomenologically, this response arises from direction-dependent coupling between the external magnetic field and the current-induced intrinsic magnetization within the chiral lattice. Furthermore, a persistent nonreciprocal response observed under perpendicular magnetic fields suggests a toroidal-induced effect linked to the electric polarization emerging from the charge-density-wave phase. These results demonstrate that bulk Mo3Al2C serves as an intrinsic platform for tunable nonreciprocal transport rooted in the interplay of chirality, polarity, and superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 main figures, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02460v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Control of thin NbN film superconducting properties by ScN buffer layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13367v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the effect of a scandium nitride buffer layer on the superconducting properties of niobium nitride thin films. The use of a ScN buffer layer significantly improves the characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films: the critical temperature Tc increases from 9 K to 12.5 K, while the resistivity at 20 K decreases from 330 mkOhm*cm to 210 mkOhm*cm compared to films without a buffer layer. These enhancements are attributed to the better lattice matching between NbN and ScN, which results in a higher quality crystal lattice of the NbN film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction data.</p></details> |  |

We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Phase diagram of the Kitaev-Hubbard model: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin and QMC approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17089v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments show that the ground state of some layered materials with localized moments is in close proximity to the Kitaev spin liquid, calling for a proper model to describe the measurements. The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Kinetic magnetism in the crossover between the square and triangular lattice Fermi-Hubbard models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15669v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Probing ground-state degeneracies of a strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard model with superconducting correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13242v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Fermi-Hubbard model and its rich phase diagram naturally emerges as a description for a wide range of electronic systems. Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 Main text figures, 9 Supplementary figures</p></details> |

By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly-interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled approach for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages with 2 figures; to appear in PRA</p></details> |
| **[Non-Equilibrium Steady States and Quantum Chaos in a three-site Driven-Dissipative Bose-Hubbard Chains base on Self-Consistent Mean-Field Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12844v3)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we apply this method to the driven Bose-Hubbard chain to illustrate the competition between coherent driving, hopping, and on-site interactions. Unlike the asymptotic high-dimensional statistics regime in random systems, here the randomness emerges dynamically from the interplay between the driving field $F$ and the nonlinearity $U$. We reveal the relation between the UV cutoff of the effective momentum space (related to the particle number truncation) and the system's chaotic behavior (SYK-like features). The inverse of the effective Hilbert space cutoff, acting as an essential degree-of-freedom (DOF) other than the bosonic modes, relates to the distribution and statistical variance of the interaction-induced coupling. By mapping the 1D chain to a high-dimensional feature space via a Gaussian-based self-attention mechanism, we replace the direct diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian with a predictive algorithm where the flavor number $O(M)$ is determined by the local potential difference generated by the Kerr non-linearity $\frac{1}{2}U$. The resulting system follows statistics intermediate between the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), contingent on the ratio $U/J$. Our algorithm allows for the automatic optimization and prediction of the resulting many-body spectrum to arbitrary accuracy, revealing non-Fermi liquid-like behavior in the strongly interacting bosonic phase.</p></details> |  |

Using Jordan-Wigner transformation, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the subsystem Loschmidt echo, and systematically investigate how its properties vary with subsystem size. It is found that when the subsystem is sufficiently large, it exhibits logarithmic divergence identical to that of the full system Loschmidt echo, yielding a critical exponent of zero. We also obtain the required subsystem size and temporal resolution for detecting dynamical quantum phase transitions using the subsystem Loschmidt echo. It is expected that the present results provide a reliable foundation for further experimental investigations.</p></details> |  |

Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $ν=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $ν=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $ν=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figures |

Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal superconductivity(SC) occurs at a moderate imbalance. Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. In addition, the SC can be possibly hosted by a single layer, which is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Within the variationally exact in infinite dimensions Gutzwiller approximation, we derive a compact analytic expression for the phase boundary between Mott and band insulator. While the method reproduces the expected band-Mott insulator phenomenology, it does not capture the correlated metallic state at finite staggered potential found for example in dynamical mean-field theory. This absence highlights that the metallic phase originates from incoherent Hubbard-band physics rather than Fermi-liquid behavior well captured by Gutzwiller approximation. Our formulation establishes a concise variational framework to ionic Hubbard model, with natural extensions to nonequilibrium setups and spin-exchange dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Acta Physica Polonica B as proceedings of the Concepts in Strongly Correlated Quantum Matter 2025 conference</p></details> |

The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. Effects of adiabaticity are calculated. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass we determine that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at intermediate phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. We estimate the transition temperature, determining that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

In this paper, we investigate the pairing tendencies in a one-dimensional, three component repulsive Hubbard model, using the density matrix renormalization group method. At half-filling, the system exhibits density wave ground state due to strong Hubbard repulsions. Upon doping, we find that Cooper pairs can emerge, whose fluctuations predominate the long-range physics in the system across a wide parameter range. The effective attractions between Cooper pairs are mediated by the particle-hole fluctuations in the third non-pairing component, resembling an excitonic mechanism of superconductivity. The coexistence of multiple density waves and superconductivity at different fermion fillings is explored. We also present an analytical study of the pairing mechanism in both weak and strong coupling limits. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding and exploring unconventional superconductivities in strongly correlated fermionic systems.</p></details> |  |

The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</p></details> |  |

We then build the layer-to-layer transfer matrix through a bidirectional-monodromy construction and prove the model's integrability via the associated global RTT relations. Using the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz, we obtain the exact eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and derive the corresponding first- and second-level Bethe equations. Finally, by taking the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix at the regular point, we recover explicitly a local Hamiltonian that features anisotropic hopping, an on-site Hubbard interaction, and orbital-coupling contributions.</p></details> |  |

A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

We present a comparative study of two control paradigms for the one-hole, half-filled Hubbard model: (i) systematic physics-guided design and (ii) autonomous deep reinforcement learning with geometry-aware neural architectures. While systematic analysis reveals key design principles, such as field-induced localization for trapping the mobile hole, it becomes computationally intractable for optimization. We show that an autonomous RL agent, benchmarked across five 3D lattices from tetrahedron to FCC, achieves human-competitive accuracy (R^2 > 0.97) and 95.5 percent success on held-out tasks. The agent is 3-4 orders of magnitude more sample-efficient than grid search and outperforms other black-box optimization methods. Transfer learning yields 91 percent few-shot generalization to unseen geometries. This work establishes autonomous RL as a viable and highly efficient framework for rapid optimization and non-obvious strategy discovery in complex quantum systems.</p></details> |  |

This leads us to prove a general result: local electron correlations in Hubbard-type models are fully classical since the local reduced density matrix is separable in the natural basis and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. These results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and nonlocal entanglement, and they provide a clear path for the study of the relationship between traditional quantum resources and the nonfreeness, in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added an explicit generalization to multiorbital/multicomponent systems + some new references + data availability statement. | 5 pages + references + end matter | 3 figures</p></details> |

Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures + supplemental</p></details> |

In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($δ\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $δ= 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $δ= 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional Hubbard model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p></details> |  |

A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+3 ...</summary><p>10+3 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, supplemental material</p></details> |

In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $χ({\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the Néel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping).</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.</p></details> |  |

Yet, despite intense recent activity, we lack experimentally testable protocols for distinguishing between different pairing scenarios. In this Letter, we construct a minimal two-band model that reproduces the Fermi-surface topology observed in recent ARPES measurements and DFT calculations, and we analyze superconductivity arising from two distinct pairing mechanisms. We show that these mechanisms yield sharply different responses to an applied perpendicular electric field. Thus, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers the unique opportunity to cleanly distinguish between different pairing scenarios. Finally, we propose three concrete experimental proposals designed to distinguish these scenarios and thereby identify the pairing mechanism most relevant to the real material.</p></details> |  |

Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.</p></details> |  |

Our results reveal two coexisting density waves that can be selectively manipulated with light. We directly identify a spin-density wave (SDW) with electronic nematicity emerging below $T_{\rm SDW}$ $\approx$ 140 K by measuring its spin dynamics, and discover a distinct, nonmagnetic charge order appearing below $T_{\rm DW}$ $\approx$ 115 K. The central finding is the demonstration of differential optical control: the charge order is fragile, completely suppressed by a pump fluence of approximately 40 $μ$J/cm$^2$, while the SDW is remarkably robust, persisting to 200 $μ$J/cm$^2$. This work establishes a clear hierarchy in the stability of competing electronic orders and provides a powerful method for disentangling their interplay in quantum materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Motivated by the experimental reports, here we study an 11-band $d-p$ Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations, using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the major superexchange couplings in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films can be substantially weaker than in the bulk material at 29.5 Gpa. Specifically, the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is reduced by about 27\% in film, while the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unaffected. We evaluate the corresponding antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\perp}$ and $J_{\parallel}$ using perturbation theory. With regard to charge transfer properties, we find that the biaxial compression in films reduces charge transfer gap. We also resolve the orbital distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals, uncovering a pronounced particle-hole asymmetry. Theses findings lay a groundwork for the study of low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and provide key insights into the understanding of physical distinctions between the film and bulk bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Apical vacancies and interbilayer interstitials emerge as the dominant low-energy defect species and are further stabilized by orthorhombic domain walls. These two defect classes drive the electronic structure in opposing directions. Vacancy-induced disorder generates local magnetic moments and promotes Anderson localization at moderate concentrations, whereas periodic interstitial ordering yields a coherent but weakly correlated metallic background that fails to support superconductivity. These findings highlight the decisive role of oxygen defects in shaping the superconducting and provide microscopic guidance for improving superconductivity through controlled defect engineering.</p></details> |  |

It is eager to enhance $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. We propose that a perpendicular electric field strongly enhances $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Under electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing is suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is strongly enhanced. We numerically verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between layers is enough to realize liquid-nitrogen-temperature HTSC in this single bilayer at AP.

Despite extensive work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. We argue that different superconducting states in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni $3d$ and O $2p$ states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ within the random phase approximation and find a transition between $d$-wave and sign-changing $s$-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin fluctuations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+6 p...</summary><p>8+6 pages, 4+10 figures</p></details> |

Using high-pressure Raman spectroscopy combined with frst-principles calculations, we unravel the structural evolution of La3Ni2O7 under pressure up to 32.7 GPa. We identify a clear structural transition sequence: from the orthorhombic Amam phase to a mixed Amam+Fmmm phase at 4 GPa, followed by a complete transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at 14.5 GPa, which is signaled by a pronounced phonon renormalization. The emergence of bulk superconductivity is found to coincide precisely with this transition to the I4/mmm phase. Our results de nitively establish the tetragonal I4/mmm structure as the host of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, resolving a central controversy and providing a critical foundation for understanding the superconducting mechanism in nickelates.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$.

Accompanied by an unusual pressure-induced fractionalization of Ni$^{2+}$ ionic spin from the standard spin-1 to spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, this trans-proximate correlation results from the emergence of a cross-layer trimer in our multi-energy-scale derivation of the electron dynamics. The resulting low-energy effective description resembles that of the cuprates and suggests a universal superconducting mechanism in all existing nickelate and cuprate superconductors. The rare trans-proximate correlation not only explains the weaker superconductivity in comparison with the related La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples, but it also indicates a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate by lowering layer symmetry. Such pressure-induced trans-proximate correlation is expected in many materials and examplifies the engineering of rich uncharted quantum states of matter through pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

Here, we address this by synthesizing high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$) with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice, particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$ rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm 2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the $c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/Å, demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

The quest to understand the governing principles of RP nickelate superconductivity has become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we report a critical advance by synthesizing and investigating a distinct structural polymorph of the same compound: the monolayer-trilayer (1313) hybrid phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Under high pressure, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic $Cmmm$ to the tetragonal $P4/mmm$ space group at 13~GPa. Above 19 GPa, the phase exhibits a clear superconducting transition, confirmed by a zero-resistance state, albeit at a significantly reduced temperature of 3.6 K. The stark contrast with the 80 K transition in the bilayer phase provides a uniquely clean experimental comparison. Our results demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature is directly governed by the nature of the interlayer coupling, and the bilayer NiO$_6$ block as the essential structural motif for achieving high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity in the RP nickelates.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures (including SI)</p></details> |

We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p></details> |  |

We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$.

| **[UTe$_2$: a narrow band superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07915v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $μ_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted as regular article</p></details> |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15147v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism in a spin triplet superconductor -- Application to UTe$_2$--](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01148v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is theoretically proposed in a spin triplet superconductor (SC) with equal spin pairs. We show that the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit $H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to $\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry. It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.</p></details> | 41pages, 14figures |
| **[Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15322v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $χ^b > χ^a > χ^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $χ^a > χ^c > χ^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |

In ultra-clean single crystals, we identify a field-induced phase transition within the superconducting state at 5.6 T, driven by metamagnetism. This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.</p></details> |  |

At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Magnetic penetration depth in topological superconductors: Effect of Majorana surface states and application for UTe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18441v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we examine how the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons and Majorana surface states influence the magnetic penetration depth in the superconductor UTe$_2$. We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($κ$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$κ$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $κ$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quasiparticle Interference of Spin-Triplet Superconductors: Application to UTe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01404v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasiparticle interference (QPI) obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful method to help extract the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors. We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</p></details> | 21 pages. 17 figures |

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |

The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $Δλ(T) \sim T^α$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $α< 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{α_R}$ with $α_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more.

This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state. Taking into account the large decrease in $K_a$ in the SC state, we conclude that the $\boldsymbol{d}$ vector has components along all three crystal axes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Suppl.: 16 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi-liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982v3)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum xy model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moiré twisted bi-layer graphene and bi-layer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear in temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those due to Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln ω_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi-surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi-surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p></details> | 65 pages, 10 figures |

Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $θ$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $π$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital Altermagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00509v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of \emph{orbital altermagnetism}, a symmetry-protected magnetic order of pure orbital degrees of freedom. It is characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking. First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$, so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand, it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO. The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.</p></details> | 16 Page, 9 Figures |
| **[Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagomé metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting state in a kagomé lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |

Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagomé lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagomé lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagomé metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagomé lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |

However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $κ_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120°, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Connecting such bosonic $π$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $π$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04601v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loop current order on the kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01648v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent discoveries in kagome materials have unveiled their capacity to harbor exotic quantum states, including intriguing charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (11 main, 5 appendix). 13 figures (8 main, 5 appendix)</p></details> |

Within the well-established two-point measurement scheme, we identify a 'heat operator,' whose moments with respect to the vacuum state of a thermofield-doubled Hilbert space correspond to the stochastic moments of the heat exchanged with a bath. This recasts heat statistics as a unitary time evolution problem, which we solve by combining chain-mapped reservoirs with tensor network propagation. In a multi-bath setup all total and bath-resolved heat moments then follow from a single pure state evolution. We employ this approach to compute transient and steady state heat fluctuations in Ohmic spin-boson models in and out of equilibrium, accessing the challenging low temperature and long memory time regimes of the environment. In the nonequilibrium case, we show a crossover in the Fano factor from super-Poissonian to nearly Poissonian statistics under strong coupling asymmetry, corresponding to thermal rectification behavior. The method applies to noninteracting (bosonic or fermionic) nonequilibrium environments with arbitrary spectral densities, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>New r...</summary><p>New results added!!

| **[Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06768v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A single-layer framework of variational tensor network states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14414v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a single-layer tensor network framework for the variational determination of ground states in two-dimensional quantum lattice models. By combining the nested tensor network method [Phys. Rev. B 96, 045128 (2017)] with the automatic differentiation technique, our approach can reduce the computational cost by three orders of magnitude in bond dimension, and therefore enables highly efficient variational ground-state calculations. We demonstrate the capability of this framework through two quantum spin models: the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice and the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model. Even without GPU acceleration or symmetry implimention, we have achieved the bond dimension of 9 and obtained accurate ground-state energy and consistent order parameters compared to prior studies. In particular, we confirm the existence of an intermediate empty-plaquette valence bond solid ground state in the Shastry-Sutherland model. We have further discussed the convergence of the algorithm and its potential improvements. Our work provides a promising route for large-scale tensor network calculations of two-dimensional quantum systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Fluid Simulations in Structured Domains Using the Lattice Boltzmann Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07615v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity fluid simulations are central to understanding transport phenomena, yet resolving large or geometrically complex systems remains computationally prohibitive with existing methods. Recently, methods based on tensor-networks, commonly known as a quantum-inspired approach, were proposed to efficiently simulate flow in simple domains, where complexity emerges mostly from turbulence. Here, we substantially extend the understanding of such methods by demonstrating for the first time that also flows governed by translational or approximate symmetries of the geometry exhibit very low effective complexity in matrix product state (MPS) form. To this end, we introduce a tensor-network formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method based on MPS and demonstrate the generality of the method on three-dimensional flows through structured media and complex vascular geometries, establishing that tensor-network techniques can efficiently resolve fluid dynamics in complex domains previously inaccessible to MPS approaches. We show that in structured media, MPS representation yields compression ratios exceeding two orders of magnitude while preserving physical structure and dynamical fidelity. This reduction enables systematic numerical exploration of regimes that were previously intractable. Our results position tensor networks as a scalable paradigm for continuum mechanics.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Simulation of Fermionic circuits using Majorana Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18939v4)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Majorana Propagation, an algorithmic framework for the classical simulation of Fermionic circuits. Inspired by Pauli Propagation, Majorana Propagation operates by applying successive truncations throughout the Heisenberg evolution of the observable. We identify monomial length as an effective truncation strategy for typical, unstructured circuits by proving that high-length Majorana monomials are exponentially unlikely to contribute to expectation values and the backflow of high-length monomials to lower-length monomials is quadratically suppressed. We provide performance guarantees by proving analytically that approximation errors decrease exponentially with the truncation threshold and that only polynomial resources are required to compute the expectation value of observables up to a fixed error for an ensemble of circuits relevant to quantum chemistry. Majorana Propagation can be used either independently, or in conjunction with quantum hardware, to simulate Fermionic systems relevant to quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We exemplify this by using Majorana Propagation to find circuits that approximate ground states for strongly correlated systems of up to 52 Fermionic modes. Our results indicate that Majorana Propagation is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art tensor-network-based circuit simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matrix Product State Simulation of Reacting Shear Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13661v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent reactive flows has been the subject of significant research interest for several decades. Accurate prediction of the effects of turbulence on the rate of reactant conversion, and the subsequent influence of chemistry on hydrodynamics remain a challenge in combustion modeling. The key issue in DNS is to account for the wide range of temporal and spatial physical scales that are caused by complex interactions of turbulence and chemistry. In this work, a new computational methodology is developed that is shown to provide a viable alternative to DNS. The framework is the matrix product state (MPS), a form of tensor network (TN) as used in computational many body physics. The MPS is a well-established ansatz for efficiently representing many types of quantum states in condensed matter systems, allowing for an exponential compression of the required memory compared to exact diagonalization methods. Due to the success of MPS in quantum physics, the ansatz has been adapted to problems outside its historical domain, notably computational fluid dynamics. Here, the MPS is used for computational simulation of a shear flow under non-reacting and nonpremixed chemically reacting conditions. Reductions of 30% in memory are demonstrated for all transport variables, accompanied by excellent agreements with DNS. The anastaz accurately captures all pertinent flow physics such as reduced mixing due to exothermicity & compressibility, and the formation of eddy shocklets at high Mach numbers. A priori analysis of DNS data at higher Reynolds numbers shows compressions as large as 99.99% for some of the transport variables. This level of compression is encouraging and promotes the use of MPS for simulations of complex turbulent combustion systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Formulation of Dequantized Algorithms for Ground State Energy Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13548v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifying quantum advantage for practical problems, particularly the ground state energy estimation (GSEE) problem, is one of the central challenges in quantum computing theory. For that purpose, dequantization algorithms play a central role in providing a clear theoretical framework to separate the complexity of quantum and classical algorithms. However, existing dequantized algorithms typically rely on sampling procedures, leading to prohibitively large computational overheads and hindering their practical implementation on classical computers. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based dequantization framework for GSEE that eliminates the sampling process while preserving the asymptotic complexity of prior dequantized algorithms. In our formulation, the overhead arising from sampling is replaced by the growth of the bond dimension required to represent Chebyshev vectors as tensor network states. Consequently, physical structure, such as entanglement and locality, is naturally reflected in the computational cost. By combining this approach with tensor network approximations, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), we construct a practical dequantization algorithm that is executable within realistic computational resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can efficiently construct high-degree polynomials up to $d=10^4$ for Hamiltonians with up to $100$ qubits, explicitly revealing the crossover between classically tractable and quantum advantaged regimes. These results indicate that tensor network-based dequantization provides a crucial tool toward the rigorous, quantitative verification of quantum advantage in realistic many-body systems.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |

In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider "all-boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>59 pa...</summary><p>59 pages self-contained summary + 101 pages main text + appendices; v2: minor revision</p></details> |

The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

The representative system under study is a semiconducting material where holes and electrons constitute two types of charge carriers. These holes and electrons diffuse in the system with the reactions of pair-generation and -recombination occurring between them. The system is driven by imbalanced conditions imposed at two boundaries. The large deviation function encoding the full counting statistics of electric current is numerically calculated using the density matrix renormalization group. The fluctuation theorem is shown to hold for the current. Moreover, by comparing the cases where the reactions are turned on or off, it is revealed that the reactions have a damping effect on current fluctuations. This indicates an interesting inequality, suggesting that current fluctuations are upper bounded.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Physical Review E</p></details> |

Here, we show that similar bipartite entanglement properties can be realized on a square lattice with anisotropic interactions in four different quadrants. The interaction to generate such entanglement is much simpler than the previous constructions by coupling orthogonal arrays of highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with different scalings of entanglement entropy at the critical point and in the lowly entangled phase, and faster decay of the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase. The tensor network representation of the new ground state consists of tensors with lower rank, while preserving a global geometry similar to that of the original networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission to SciPost</p></details> |
| **[Reduced Density Matrices and Phase-Space Distributions in Thermofield Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21302v2)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermofield dynamics (TFD) is a powerful framework to account for thermal effects in a wavefunction setting, and has been extensively used in physics and quantum optics. TFD relies on a duplicated state space and creates a correlated two-mode thermal state via a Bogoliubov transformation acting on the vacuum state. However, a very useful variant of TFD uses the vacuum state as initial condition and transfers the Bogoliubov transformation into the propagator. This variant, referred to here as the inverse Bogoliubov transformation (iBT) variant, has recently been applied to vibronic coupling problems and coupled-oscillator Hamiltonians in a chemistry context, where the method is combined with efficient tensor network methods for high-dimensional quantum propagation. In the iBT/TFD representation, the mode expectation values are clearly defined and easy to calculate, but the thermalized reduced particle distributions such as the reduced 1-particle densities or Wigner distributions are highly non-trivial due to the Bogoliubov back-transformation of the original thermal TFD wavefunction. Here we derive formal expressions for the reduced 1-particle density matrix (1-RDM) that uses the correlations between the real and tilde modes encoded in the associated reduced 2-particle density matrix (2-RDM). We apply this formalism to define the 1-RDM and the Wigner distributions in the special case of a thermal harmonic oscillator. Moreover, we discuss several approximate schemes that can be extended to higher-dimensional distributions. These methods are demonstrated for the thermal reduced 1-particle density of an anharmonic oscillator.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, two short appendices.

| **[Uniform matrix product states with a boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11968v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Canonical forms are central to the analytical understanding of tensor network states, underpinning key results such as the complete classification of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases within the matrix product state (MPS) framework. Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators.</p></details> | 97 pages |
| **[Holographic Representation of One-Dimensional Many-Body Quantum States via Isometric Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11967v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) allow for efficient and accurate simulations of higher-dimensional quantum systems by enforcing an isometric structure. We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary "holographic" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

While both ansätze are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 8767-8781] reported a non-negligible discrepancy in its calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for MPS and TTNS. By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we reduce the relative difference in occupancy for weakly populated electronic states from up to 60% towards the end of the simulation to less than 10% and the absolute difference from 0.05 to 0.005. We also discuss the impact of tensor network structures on accuracy and efficiency, with the difference further reduced by an optimized TTNS structure. Our results confirm that both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partitioned Expansions for Approximate Tensor Network Contractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10910v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.</p></details> | 18 pages, 20 figures |

We present an efficient algorithm that converts pure bosonic Gaussian states into matrix product states (MPSs), with a computational cost governed solely by the entanglement and not by the number of bosonic modes. Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians. Benchmarking on covariance matrices from the Jiuzhang 2.0 and Jiuzhang 4.0 Gaussian boson sampling experiments demonstrates substantial speedups over previous tensor-network approaches in the low-entanglement regime relevant to lossy devices. The method provides a scalable classical simulation framework for bosonic Gaussian states with limited entanglement and extends the applicability of MPS-based methods to a broad range of bosonic systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we challenge this conventional wisdom by showing that QEM can continue to provide substantial benefits in the era of quantum error correction (QEC), and in an even more efficient manner than it does on current devices. We introduce a framework for logical-level QEM that leverages soft information naturally produced by QEC decoders, requiring no additional data, hardware modifications, or runtime overhead beyond what QEC protocols already provide. Within this framework, we develop and analyze three logical-level QEM techniques: post-selection and runtime abort policies, probabilistic error cancellation, and zero-noise extrapolation. Our techniques reduce logical error rates by more than 100x while discarding fewer than 0.1% of shots; they also provide in situ characterization of logical channels for QEM protocols. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our approach using a surface-code architecture and two state-of-the-art decoders based on tensor-network contraction and minimum-weight perfect matching. We evaluate logical-level QEM on random Clifford circuits and molecular simulation algorithms and find that, compared to previous approaches relying on QEC only or QEC combined with QEM, we can achieve up to 87.4% spacetime overhead savings. Our results demonstrate that logical-level QEM with QEC decoder soft information can reliably improve logical performance, underscoring the efficiency and usefulness of QEM techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.</p></details> |  |

We report numerical results based on simulations of system comprising up to 2304 particles. We find a superfluid ground state for $r_s$ as large as 70, i.e., significantly above the most recent numerical estimate of the Wigner crystallization threshold, which we estimate at $r_W \approx 71$. Furthermore, no thermally re-entrant crystalline phase nor any evidence of metastable bubbles is observed near the transition, in contrast with a previous theoretical study in which quantum statistics was neglected.

The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Combining quantum Monte Carlo, Gross-Pitaevskii equation and field-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the bound serves as a reliable estimator of the superfluid fraction for strongly interacting bosons at 2D-1D dimensional crossover at low temperatures. By further presenting two counterexamples where the bound predicts trivial results, we shed light on the conditions under which the Leggett's bound serves as a good predictor.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Magnetic order and novel quantum criticality in the strongly interacting quasicrystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13546v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo study of the half-filled Hubbard model on two-dimensional quasicrystals, revealing how specific aperiodic geometries fundamentally dictate quantum criticality. By comparing the Penrose and Thue-Morse quasicrystals, we demonstrate that the nature of the magnetic phase transition is controlled by the electronic density of states (DOS): while the singular DOS of the Penrose tiling induces magnetic order at infinitesimal interaction strengths, the Thue-Morse lattice requires a finite critical interaction to drive the transition. Crucially, through a novel boundary construction strategy and rigorous finite-size scaling, we identify a quantum critical point on the Thue-Morse quasicrystal with critical exponents ($ν\approx 0.94$, $β\approx 0.72$ and $z\approx 1.51$) that deviate significantly from the conventional $(2+1)$D Heisenberg $O(3)$ class. These findings establish the existence of a novel universality class driven by the interplay between electronic correlations and aperiodic geometry, challenging standard paradigms of magnetic criticality in two dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+5 p...</summary><p>9+5 pages, 4+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Cluster-diagrammatic D-TRILEX approach to non-local electronic correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06015v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we extend the theoretical approach known as "D-TRILEX", developed for solving correlated electronic systems, to a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Projected Density Matrix Sampling for Lattice Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19209v2)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $β$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $β$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 13 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Experimental benchmark of the quantum-classical crossover in a spin ladder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12234v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a spin-(1/2, 5/2) three-leg ladder realized in a radical-Mn polymer, exhibiting an antiferromagnetic transition and magnetization curves accurately described by classical mean-field theory. Although the underlying spin model intrinsically supports strong quantum fluctuations, as confirmed by quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the real system shows an anomalously complete suppression of quantum behavior. These findings provide a key experimental benchmark for the quantum-classical crossover and suggest that lattice topology can play a crucial role in tuning the balance between quantum and classical physics in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Convergence of the Cumulant Expansion and Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Weakly Interacting Fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12010v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function of weakly interacting fermions with polynomial runtime in both the system size and precision. Although weakly interacting fermionic systems are considered tractable for many computational methods such as the diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo, a mathematically rigorous proof of polynomial runtime has been lacking. In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime.</p></details> |  |

However, this conclusion has mainly relied on finite-size scaling of the entanglement entropy, lacking direct evidence from physical observables.} Here, we investigate the dynamical spectra of spin and bond operators at the deconfined critical point of the $J$-$Q_3$ model using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and contrasting them with the well-established $\mathrm{O(3)}$ Wilson-Fisher criticality in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. Although both models exhibit two gapless magnon modes in the Néel phase, their critical behaviors diverge strikingly. At the $J_1$-$J_2$ critical point, the Higgs mode becomes gapless, yielding three gapless modes that reflect the full restoration of the $\mathrm{O(3)}$ symmetry. {In the $J$-$Q_3$ model, we instead observe four gapless transverse modes at the either side of the transition. This spectral feature, together with the entanglement entropy results, provides direct evidence for the weakly first-order scenario that the deconfined quantum critical point exhibits an emergent $\mathrm{SO(5)}$ symmetry that spontaneously breaks to $\mathrm{O(4)}$.</p></details> | 7 pages,4 figures |
| **[Addressing the Infinite Variance Problem in Fermionic Monte Carlo Simulations: Retrospective Error Remediation and the Exact Bridge Link Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08937v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages + appendix, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality: Honeycomb vs. SLAC fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15000v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perform large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model at half filling with a single Dirac cone close to the critical point, which separates a Dirac semi-metal from an antiferromagnetically ordered phase where SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We discuss the implementation of a single Dirac cone in the SLAC formulation for eight Dirac components and the influence of dynamically induced long-range super-exchange interactions. The finite size behavior of dimensionless ratios and the finite size scaling properties of the Hubbard model with a single Dirac cone are shown to be superior compared to the honeycomb lattice. We extract the critical exponent believed to belong to the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class: The critical exponent ${ν= 1.02(3)}$ coincides for the two lattice types once honeycomb lattices of linear dimension ${L\ge 15}$ are considered. In contrast to the SLAC formulation, where the anomalous dimensions are estimated to be ${η_φ=0.73(1)}$ and ${η_ψ=0.09(1)}$, they remain less stable on honeycomb lattices, but tend towards the estimates from the SLAC formulation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Correlation effects in one-dimensional metallic quantum wires under various confinements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17925v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density parameters $r_{\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation (FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function, correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$ (harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches $ε_{\rm c}(r_{\rm s})= - π^2/360 \sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys. Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$ (infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well), and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $ε_{\rm c} \sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static structure factor at $k=2k_{\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA.</p></details> |  |

Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal superconductivity(SC) occurs at a moderate imbalance. Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. In addition, the SC can be possibly hosted by a single layer, which is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Planckian Bounds via Spectral Moments of Optical Conductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09979v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The observation of Planckian scattering, often inferred from Drude fits in strongly correlated metals, raises the question of how to extract an intrinsic timescale from measurable quantities in a model-independent way. We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 4 pages + references; Supplementary material: 3 pages</p></details> |

The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. Effects of adiabaticity are calculated. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass we determine that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at intermediate phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. We estimate the transition temperature, determining that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice States in Overdoped Cuprate Superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09547v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cuprate superconductors remain central to condensed matter physics due to their technological relevance and unconventional, incompletely understood electronic behavior. While the canonical phase diagram and low-energy models have been shaped largely by studies of underdoped and moderately doped cuprates, the overdoped regime has received comparatively limited attention.Here, we track the evolution of the electronic structure from optimal to heavy overdoping in La2-xSrxCuO4(LSCO) using broadband optical spectroscopy across x=0.15-0.60. The measured spectral changes--including the redistribution of Zhang-Rice-related spectral weigh--are in qualitative agreement with determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the three-orbital Emery model, which together indicate a pronounced reconstruction of the electronic structure beyond hole concentrations x>0.2. Guided by these observations, we propose a spontaneous checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice electronic configuration that captures the coexistence of itinerant and localized carriers characteristic of the heavily overdoped state. Our results refine the doping-dependent Zhang-Rice-based framework for cuprates, illuminate how correlations persist deep into the overdoped regime, and provide new constraints on microscopic mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity, with broader implications for correlated transition-metal oxides.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stoquasticity is not enough: towards a sharper diagnostic for Quantum Monte Carlo simulability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14382v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, yet their applicability is limited by the infamous sign problem. We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[How a bilayer Nickelate superconducts: a Quantum Monte Carlo study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09025v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using determinant Quantum Monte Carlo, we investigate the interplay between doping, inter-layer tunneling and onsite Hund's coupling in stabilizing superconductivity (SC) in a two-orbital model for the bilayer Nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$. With realistic dispersion and for certain values of the interaction parameters, the auxiliary-field-decoupled fermion Hamiltonian has Kramers anti-unitary symmetries which guarantee the absence of a sign problem. The same anti-unitary symmetries can also be used to show there is a second instability towards $(π,π)$ exciton condensation in the strong interaction limit. We indicate the possible connection between this exciton order and the enigmatic density wave state observed in experiment, and clarify the decisive role played by the inter-layer tunneling in the competition between SC and exciton condensation. Finally, possible directions on how to enhance the SC transition temperature and stabilize the SC phase are also discussed.</p></details> |  |

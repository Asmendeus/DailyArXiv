| **[Anyon Superconductivity from Topological Criticality in a Hofstadter-Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18175v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that the combination of strong repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moir\'e materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>15+17...</summary><p>15+17 pages, 3+3 figures. v3: final version published in PNAS</p></details> |
| **[Ambient-pressure superconductivity and electronic structures of engineered hybrid nickelate films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03502v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have emerged as a crucial platform for exploring the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. However, the Fermi surface topology required for superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we report the thin film growth and ambient-pressure superconductivity of both hybrid monolayer-bilayer (1212) and pure bilayer (2222) structures, together with the absence of superconductivity in hybrid monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, under identical compressive epitaxial strain. The onset superconducting transition temperature is up to 50 K, exceeding the McMillan limit, in the 1212 structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals key Fermi surface differences in these atomically-engineered structures. In superconducting 1212 and 2222 films, a dispersive hole-like band (i.e. the {\gamma} band) crosses the Fermi level, surrounding the Brillouin zone corner. In contrast, the top of the {\gamma} flat band is observed ~70 meV below the Fermi level in the non-superconducting 1313 films. Our findings expand the family of ambient-pressure nickelate superconductors and establish a connection between structural configuration, electronic structure, and the emergence of superconductivity in nickelates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity and normal-state transport in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08022v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure in Ruddlesden-Popper phases of bulk nickelates has sparked great interest in stabilizing ambient pressure superconductivity in thin-film form using epitaxial strain. Recently, signs of superconductivity have been observed in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films with an onset temperature exceeding 40 K, albeit with broad and two-step-like transitions. Here, we report intrinsic superconductivity and normal-state transport properties in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films, achieved through a combination of isovalent Pr substitution, growth optimization, and precision ozone annealing. The superconducting onset occurs above 48 K, with zero resistance reached above 30 K, and the critical current density at 1.4 K is 100-fold larger than previous reports. The normal-state resistivity exhibits quadratic temperature dependence indicative of Fermi liquid behaviour, and other phenomenological similarities to transport in overdoped cuprates suggest parallels in their emergent properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Topology meets superconductivity in a one-dimensional $t-J$ model of magnetic atoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03387v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strongly interacting fermions represent the key constituent of several intriguing phases of matter. However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Family of Unconventional Superconductivities in Crystalline Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03295v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unconventional superconductors exhibit multiple broken symmetries and exceed the range of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. For instance, time-reversal symmetry can be broken in addition to the gauge symmetry, resulting in superconductors that can be enhanced or induced by a magnetic field. However, such unconventional superconductivities are more vulnerable to impurities than their BCS counterparts, requiring highly ordered and clean material systems to observe them. Crystalline rhombohedral multilayer graphene is a promising platform to explore unconventional superconductivity due to its superior material quality and gate-tunable strong correlation effects. Here we report transport measurements of rhombohedral tetralayer and pentalayer graphene, where a spectrum of superconductivities in a clean limit are observed. Three of them (SC2-4) show highly unusual enhancements by magnetic fields: 1. SC2 is strengthened by an in-plane field; 2. SC3 is boosted by a small out-of-plane field; 3. SC4 is induced by an in-plane field. All these superconductors are robust against an in-plane field up to 8.5 Tesla, exceeding the Pauli limit of conventional superconductors by tens of times and suggesting their unconventional nature. Moreover, we observed that proximitized spin-orbit coupling generates a plethora of new superconductors in the phase diagram, while maintaining the high quality of bare rhombohedral graphene. Our work establishes a family of new superconductors in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which also provides an ideal platform to engineer non-Abelian quasiparticles by proximitizing with quantum anomalous Hall states existing in the same material system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Keldysh field theory approach to direct electric and thermoelectric currents in quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17623v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the transport properties of a quantum dot contacted to two superconducting reservoirs by means of the Keldysh field theory approach, showing how this technique allows us to straightforwardly recover previous results, resulting extremely effective in dealing with quantum transport problems. In particular, we determine the direct current occurring at equilibrium and the electric and thermoelectric currents triggered when the system is driven out of equilibrium by a voltage or a temperature bias, also for a normal-quantum dot-superconductor junction. The main result of the work is the derivation of the full expression for the thermoelectric current in a superconductor-quantum dot-superconductor junction for any values of the temperature difference between the superconducting leads. We show that in the linear response regime, in addition to the Josephson current, a weakly phase-dependent thermoelectric contribution occurs, provided that electron-hole symmetry is broken. Far from linearity, instead, other contributions arise which lead to thermoelectric effects, dominant at weak coupling, also in the presence of particle-hole symmetry.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Observation of surface superconductivity in bulk polycrystalline MoS2 induced by electric double-layer doping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03031v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the observation of electric-field-induced superconductivity on the surface of bulk polycrystalline MoS2 using electric double-layer doping. A gate voltage applied in an ionic liquid environment systematically increased carrier density, leading to an insulator-to-metal transition and a sharp resistance drop at low temperatures, indicating superconductivity. The onset temperature of superconductivity strongly depended on carrier density inferred from conductance, showing a significant increase and eventual saturation. Unlike prior studies limited to single-crystalline MoS2, our results demonstrate that superconductivity can also be electrostatically induced in polycrystalline systems, broadening the scope for exploring gate-controlled superconductivity in a wider range of materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital-selective two-gap superconductivity in kagome metal CsV3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17327v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multi-gap superconductivity in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the impact of multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) on the multiple superconducting gaps remains not fully understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the multi-orbital electronic structure and superconducting gap properties of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals exhibit strong coupling to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the Sb-5pz orbitals show weak coupling to the out-of-plane vibrations of both Cs and the apical Sb atoms. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Chiral Superconductivity in the Triangular-Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02757v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moir\'e materials provide exciting platforms for studying the interplay of strong electronic correlation and large magnetic flux effects. We study the lightly doped Hofstadter-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice through large-scale density matrix renormalization group and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find strong evidence for a robust chiral superconducting (SC) phase with dominant power-law pairing correlations and a quantized spin Chern number. The SC phase emerges at very weak interaction and grows stronger at intermediate interaction strengths (U ) for a wide range of hole doping. We also discuss the possible distinct nature of the normal state in different U regimes. Our work provides theoretical insights into the emergence of topological superconductivity from doping topological Chern bands or magnetic flux induced chiral spin liquid states of Moir\'e materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust superconductivity upon doping chiral spin liquid and Chern insulators in a Hubbard-Hofstadter model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02675v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demonstrating superconductivity in purely repulsive Hubbard models is a compelling goal which underscores the counter-intuitive ability of Coulomb interactions to mediate superconductivity. Here, we present numerical evidence for robust superconductivity in a triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model at $\pi/2$ flux per plaquette. Employing infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations on infinite cylinders of finite circumference, we observe superconducting ground states for a wide range of dopings, whose pair-correlations strengthen as the 2D limit is approached. At a density of one electron per site, Hubbard interactions have been reported to drive the insulating parent state of the superconductor from an integer quantum Hall (IQH) state to a chiral spin liquid (CSL). Our findings give credence to a recent proposal that proximity to the IQH-CSL transition serves to make chiral superconductivity energetically favorable on doping, and also correctly predicts the nature of the edge modes in the superconductor. On the CSL side, this suggests the superconductor can be thought of as arising from Laughlin's `anyon superconductivity' mechanism. Thus the Hubbard-Hofstadter model studied here offers a clean and experimentally accessible setup, potentially realizable in moir\'e heterostructures, for exploring the properties of anyonic matter at finite density and the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality and superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+15 ...</summary><p>5+15 pages, 5+10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Diamagnetic Meissner response of odd-frequency superconducting pairing from quantum geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02243v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the role of quantum geometry in the Meissner response for odd-frequency superconducting pairs in multiband systems. Odd-frequency pairing is traditionally associated with a paramagnetic Meissner response, which raises questions about the stability of the superconducting phase, especially in multiband systems where odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitous. Using analytical calculations in a general two-band, we show that the quantum geometric contribution to the Meissner response from odd-frequency pairs is always diamagnetic for its interband processes, while intraband processes always yield a paramagnetic response. With odd-frequency pairing itself generated by interband pairing, an overall diamagnetic response may often be anticipated. We confirm these results with numerical calculations of models with both flat and dispersive bands. In flat band systems, where geometric effects dominate, the diamagnetic odd-frequency response can even exceed the even-frequency contribution, making odd-frequency pairs the primary source of the diamagnetic Meissner response. In a dispersive two-band system with finite quantum geometry, we similarly find a robust diamagnetic contribution from odd-frequency pairing, even when the total response turns paramagnetic due to even-frequency contributions. These results establish that quantum geometry stabilizes odd-frequency superconductivity and also identify flat-band materials as candidates for realizing odd-frequency superconductivity with a diamagnetic Meissner effect.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Observing Two-Particle Correlation Dynamics in Tunable Superconducting Bose-Hubbard Simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02180v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation and propagation of quantum correlations are central to understanding many dynamical properties of quantum systems, yet their precise experimental control and characterization remain a key challenge. Here we experimentally study the two-particle correlation dynamics via quantum walks in superconducting Bose-Hubbard qutrit arrays, with tunable on-site interaction $U$ realized by Floquet engineering. Quantum walks show the characteristic change from bosonic bunching to fermionic antibunching with increasing $U$. The two-particle entanglement and quantum correlation dynamics, as measured by negativity and quantum discord, are investigated. We find that depending on the initial state, the propagation of entanglement can be strongly suppressed with increasing $U$, while that of quantum discord exhibits considerably larger amplitude; or both of them appear insensitive to $U$. Furthermore, the forms of entanglement are found to persist throughout particle walks for $U =$ 0 and it is generally not the case when $U$ increases. Our work highlights the role of interaction in shaping quantum dynamics and extends the realm of simulating correlated quantum systems with superconducting circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Three prerequisites for high-temperature superconductivity in t-PtBi$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02178v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the generic mechanism behind high-temperature superconductivity remains notoriously elusive, a set of favorable conditions for its occurrence in a given material has emerged: (i) the electronic structure should have a very high density of states near the Fermi level; (ii) electrons need to be susceptible to a sizable interaction with another degree of freedom to ensure pairing themselves; (iii) the ability to fine-tune some of the system properties significantly helps maximising the critical temperature. Here, by means of high-resolution ARPES, we show that all three criteria are remarkably fulfilled in trigonal platinum bismuthide (t-PtBi$_2$). Specifically, this happens on its surface, which hosts topological surface states known as Fermi arcs. Our findings pave the way for the stabilisation and optimisation of high-temperature superconductivity in this topological material.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-situ electro-optic sampling of microwave signals under cryogenic conditions and for superconducting applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00162v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate a cryogenic electro-optic sampling (EOS) setup that allows for the measurement of microwave signals at arbitrary positions on a cryogenic chip-scale device. We use a Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) to generate quantum-accurate voltage signals and measure them with the EOS setup, allowing for the calibration of its response, yielding traceability of the microwave measurements to a quantum standard. We use the EOS setup to determine the time-domain response of ultrafast cryogenic photodiodes and the electrical reflection coefficient, i.e., the S11 scattering parameter, in a superconducting transmission line. Finally, we introduce an optical femtosecond pulse source which can be used to study the fidelity of superconducting transmission lines and terminations, as well as reflections from elements like Josephson junction arrays imbedded in them.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reentrant superconductivity and superconductor-to-insulator transition in a naturally occurring Josephson junction array tuned by RF power](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02063v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity, characterized by dissipationless current flow with flux expulsion or quantization, is usually muted when the magnetic field or the temperature is sufficiently high. However, in rare instances, superconductivity can reappear upon increasing the temperature or magnetic field, a phenomenon known as reentrant superconductivity. It usually emerges from competing orders in strongly correlated materials. Here we demonstrate reentrant superconductivity as a function of both temperature and magnetic field, tuned by radio frequency (RF) power in a relatively simple system: granular aluminum (grAl), which exhibits the properties of a naturally occurring Josephson junction array. At low temperatures, giant Shapiro steps emerge, exhibiting characteristics of a single Josephson junction. Coherent phase locking across the array's multiple junctions amplifies the quantized voltage, enabling tunability at radio frequencies, as observed in artificially designed Josephson arrays. We show that our system can be tuned from a coherent superconducting (stiff-phase) to an insulating (phase-fluctuating) state using RF power. We propose that the RF power modulates the Josephson coupling energy, $E_J$. Remarkably, at elevated temperatures, the screening of the electron charge suppresses the charging energy, causing superconductivity to reappear. This many-body effect cannot be described within a single junction framework and involves many-body correlations. Our system can therefore be tuned to observe both the single-junction regime and many-body correlation effects, serving as a quantum simulator for complex phenomena in condensed matter physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-level system loss characterization of NbTi superconducting resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01447v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators, key components for quantum computing and sensing applications, require a high internal quality factor (Qi) for effective qubit readout and quantum sensing applications. Minimizing two-level system (TLS) losses, particularly at material interfaces, is critical for gatemon and topological qubits operating at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields. NbTi, a superconducting alloy with a high upper critical field, enables SCPW resonators resilient to such conditions. We fabricated NbTi SCPW resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates and systematically characterized their TLS-limited quality factors as functions of temperature and microwave photon number. Our results demonstrate that NbTi-based SCPWs on Si/SiO2 substrates provide a promising platform for developing next-generation quantum circuits.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Luminescence-Induced Tunable Superconductivity in BSCCO via GaP Quantum Dots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01154v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The enhancement of superconducting properties in high-temperature copper-oxide superconductor B(P)SCCO remains a hot research topic in the field of superconducting materials. Building on previous research, here we introduce GaP quantum dots as an heterophase into the B(P)SCCO superconductor, aiming to enhance its superconductivity through the luminescent properties of GaP quantum dots. The experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of GaP quantum dots into B(P)SCCO generates significant tunable superconducting effects, leading to enhanced critical transition temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc), and Meissner field (Hc) of B(P)SCCO with increasing luminescent intensity of the GaP quantum dots. The enhancement effect induced by GaP quantum dots exhibits a positive correlation with luminescent intensity, meaning samples with the addition of GaP quantum dots exhibiting higher luminescent intensity show elevated Tc, Jc, and Hc values. Unlike impurity effects, a distinct critical concentration dependency is observed. Notably, this GaP quantum dot modification strategy is not only effective in conventional superconductors but also applicable to high-temperature oxide superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supercurrent Time Division Multiplexing with Solid-State Integrated Hybrid Superconducting Electronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11721v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-division multiplexing of cryogenic signals is a promising approach to reduce space requirements, shorten cooldown times, and increase the number of quantum devices measured per cooldown. We demonstrate time-division multiplexing of non-dissipative supercurrents using voltage-controlled hybrid superconducting demultiplexers. These chips integrate superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors including Al superconducting electrodes, proximitized semiconducting InAs channels, and hafnium oxide gate insulators. Each transistor fully suppresses the switching current and increases the resistance 20 times under a gate voltage of -4.5 V. A demultiplexer with one input and eight outputs showed a non-dissipative input range of +-2 uA, operating up to 100 MHz in signal frequency and 100 kHz in switching frequency at 50 mK. It achieved near-zero insertion loss in the superconducting state and an ON/OFF ratio of 17.5 dB. By optimizing the signal layout, the operation was extended up to 4 GHz using a demultiplexer with two outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, supporting information at the end of the paper. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.07630</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting Diode Effect in Gradiently Strained Nb0.5Ti0.5N Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00942v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE), combining superconductivity with diode-like nonreciprocal current flow, recently emerges as an ideal candidate for zero-dissipation electronic circuits. Such technologically advantageous diodes are achieved by intricate material engineering to disrupt inversion symmetry, which leads to the production challenges as well as a limited pool of viable materials. Here we exploit the gradient interfacial strain to experimentally induce the SDE in Nb0.5Ti0.5N (NTN) films grown on MgO substrates. Additionally, the SDE is tunable with an in-plane magnetic field and can be further enhanced by introducing an interfacial anisotropic pinning potential. Our findings establish interfacial strain gradient as a versatile tool for creating and enhancing tunable SDE.</p></details> | 4 figures |

Trainmon consists of parallel branches of identical Josephson junctions. The Hamiltonian for this circuit resembles a discrete cosine transform, which can be applied to mimic various potentials. This framework is applied to well-known qubit potentials such as Quarton and Fluxonium, and their Hamiltonians are extracted and solved to validate the transition frequencies and calculate the coherence times of both the original qubits and their Trainmon-based versions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

We present a joint theoretical and experimental exploration of possible signatures of fermion pairing with finite center-of-mass momentum, or the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) order. Experimentally a doped and spin-imbalanced attractive two-dimensional Hubbard model is realized with a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice, and quantum gas microscopy is used to probe its properties. Computationally we study the same model with state-of-the-art constrained-path (CP) auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Direct comparisons between experiment and computation on various short-range magnetic and charge correlations show excellent agreement. We then investigate these correlations, as well as pairing correlation functions, systematically to low temperatures with CP-AFQMC, and determine parameter regimes in density and magnetization where signatures of FFLO order may be observed. We show that the temperature at which precursors of such orders appear is already within reach of the current experiment. We discuss routes for direct experimental detection and measurements of such states.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study a hardware-efficient protocol for measuring complex expectation values of the time-evolution operator, commonly referred to as Loschmidt echoes, with fermions in an optical superlattice. We analyze the algorithm for the Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling as well as at finite doping. The method relies on global quench dynamics and short imaginary time evolution, the latter being realized by architecture-tailored pulse sequences starting from a product state of plaquettes. Our numerical results show that complex Loschmidt echoes can be efficiently obtained for large many-body states over a broad spectral range. This allows one to measure spectral properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model, such as the local density of states, and paves the way for the study of finite-temperature properties in current fermionic quantum simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+6 p...</summary><p>9+6 pages, 5+4 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |

In order to analyze the inhomogeneous system we employ real-space bosonic dynamical mean-field theory and perform an ensemble average over disorder realizations. To distinguish the MI from the BG phase, we compare the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the compressibility with the energy gap condition. To identify the insulator to SF transition, we apply a percolation analysis to the condensate order parameter. In qualitative accordance with the theorem of inclusions we always find an intermediate BG phase between the SF and MI. However, the quantitative comparison indicates significant deviations between the MI to BG phase boundary expected in the thermodynamic limit and the one obtained for a finite system size. Analyzing the spectral function in the strong-coupling regime reveals evidence for analytically predicted damped localized modes in the dispersion relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages (main text), 7 pages (total), 4 figures, submitted to Physical Review Letters, manuscript in review</p></details> |
| **[Excitation Gaps of Ground and Excited State Energy of the Fermi-Hubbard Model Using Variational Quantum Eigensolver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12307v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hubbard model is a challenging quantum many-body problem and serves as a benchmark for quantum computing research. Accurate computation of its ground and excited state energies is essential for understanding correlated electron systems. In this study, the ground, first, and second excited state energies of 4$\times$1 and 2$\times$2 Hubbard lattices are obtained using a newly designed ansatz circuit. The ansatz is constructed by combining concepts from the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and the Number-Preserving Ansatz (NPA). A hybrid optimization strategy is applied, where COBYLA is used for coarse convergence and L-BFGS for fine-tuning. The resulting energies are evaluated, and the corresponding physical properties of the systems are analyzed through phase diagrams of the energy excitation gaps for different charge and spin configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strange diffusivity of incoherent metal in half-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00281v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study charge transport across the metal-insulator crossover in the half-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model, with particular emphasis on precision control. The dynamic current-current correlation function is obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit, and the optical conductivity is extracted using numerical analytic continuation. To achieve this, we develop a multiscale approach: the non-perturbative low-frequency behavior is computed using the unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, while the high-frequency physics is captured via a self-consistent (semi-)analytic diagrammatic theory. We found that across a broad temperature range where the DC resistivity displays anomalous scaling, $\sim T^\alpha$ with $0<\alpha\lesssim 1$, the Nernst-Einstein relation implies the diffusion constant with the characteristic $\sim 1/\sqrt{T}$ "strange metal" behavior. It was also revealed that the insulating regime is entered through a peculiar non-Fermi liquid state-which we call a Pseudogap Metal-characterized by insulating charge compressibility coexisting with metallic transport. Diagrammatically, the high-temperature incoherent transport is captured by the dressed polarization bubble, whereas near the metal-insulator crossover, the effective interaction vertex between opposite-spin particles is responsible for transferring the Drude weight to a high-frequency continuum.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

For a fixed dimerization, $\delta$, and staggered potential, V , we find by increasing U the quasiparticle edge states in the charge gap to come down in energy from V in the absence of Hubbard interaction to zero energy for U $\approx$ 2V . This presents an uncommon case where repulsion leads to zero-energy edge states. Upon increasing U further, the edge state energy starts increasing again until they are lost in the bulk. However, upon increasing U even further, these edge states reappear in the high energy gap. So, with Hubbard interaction, the edge states in Rice-Mele chain transmigrate from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Self-consistent dynamical Hubbard functional for correlated solids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18194v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many-body functionals of the Green's function can provide fundamental advances in electronic-structure calculations, due to their ability to accurately predict both spectral and thermodynamic properties, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and total energies of materials. However, fully first-principles, self-consistent calculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge, ultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and restricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we present a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids using a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical Hubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating frequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to accurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials with $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we employ the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles representation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for frequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution for dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the paradigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral features, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving the description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Numerical validation of an ultracold Hubbard quantum simluator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18041v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply the formally exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method to probe the unprecedentedly low-temperature regime recently achieved in an ultracold-atom quantum simulation of the 2D Hubbard model [Xu et al., Nature 642, 909 (2025)]. Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Experimental observation of multimode quantum phase transitions in a superconducting Bose-Hubbard simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20116v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of phase transitions and critical phenomena arising in quantum driven-dissipative systems, and whether a correspondence can be drawn to their equilibrium counterparts, is a pressing question in contemporary physics. The development of large-scale superconducting circuits provides an experimental platform for these theoretical models. We report an experimental study of a multi-mode dissipative first-order phase transition in a 1D Bose-Hubbard chain consisting of 21 superconducting resonators. This phase transition manifests itself as a simultaneous frequency jump in all resonator modes as the frequency or power of a pump tone is swept. By measuring the system's emission spectrum through the transition, we characterize the dim-to-bright phase transition and construct the full phase diagram. We further perform time-dependent measurements of the switching between the two phases in the transition region, from which we corroborate the transition line and extract transition times ranging from a few ms up to 143~s. Our model, based on single-mode mean-field theory and cross-Kerr interactions, captures the features at moderate pump powers and quantitatively reproduces the transition line. Our results open a new window into non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and mark a step toward realizing and understanding dissipative phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit using superconducting quantum circuits.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Engineering Hubbard models with gated two-dimensional moiré systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13314v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moir\'e systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moir\'e potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moir\'e potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moir\'e potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moir\'e systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

The Hubbard energy is believed to be material specific and constant. However, it has recently been pointed out that even subtle structural changes can induce changes in $U$ parameters. For LuO, we theoretically evaluated $U$ energy dependence of the differential transmission and reflectivity spectra to assess the impact of $U$ energy on the optical properties. In addition to the conventional derivative-like contribution, we observed the influence of the Drude tail owing to $U$-induced plasma energy modulation. Given the typical detection sensitivity of differential spectroscopy ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-4}$), even a few meV modulations in $U$ are sufficient for a detectable spectral response.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Jpn.

| **[Qubit parametrization of the variational discrete action theory for the multiorbital Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20111v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The variational discrete action theory (VDAT) at \mathcal{N}=3 is a potent tool for accurately capturing Mott and Hund physics at zero temperature in d=\infty at a cost comparable to the Gutzwiller approximation, which is recovered by VDAT at \mathcal{N}=2. Here we develop a qubit parametrization of the gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3 for the multiorbital Hubbard model with general density-density interactions. The qubit parametrization yields an explicit variational trial energy, and the variational parameters consist of the momentum density distribution, the shape of a reference fermi surface, and the pure state of a qubit system with dimension of the local Hilbert space. To illustrate the power of the qubit parametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital Hubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor series expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how the Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition. For the case of the SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard model, an explicit approach for computing the critical U_{c} for the Mott transition is provided, yielding an analytical expression for U_{c} in the large N_{orb} limit. Additionally, we provide an analytical solution for the ground state properties of the single band Hubbard model with a special density of states. Finally, we demonstrate that the qubit parametrization can also be applied to \mathcal{N}=2, for both G-type and B-type variants, where the G-type yields an identical expression to the slave spin mean-field theory. The qubit parametrization not only improves the efficiency and transparency of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3, but also provides the key advances for the construction of a one-body reduced density matrix functional capable of capturing Mott and Hund physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+9 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Path-integral Method for Fictitious Particle Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01760v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</p></details> |  |

The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary finite-size lattice.</p></details> |  |

Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U and the number of flavor N . We construct the critical theory for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid and calculate the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N . These results could be validated in synthetic systems such as moir'e superlattices and cold atom platforms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition.

We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion.

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

Here, we employ resonant soft x-ray scattering and polarimetry on thin films of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to determine that the magnetic structure of the SDW forms unidirectional diagonal spin stripes with moments lying within the NiO$_2$ plane and perpendicular to $\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, but without evidence of the strong charge disproportionation typically associated with other nickelates. These stripes form anisotropic domains with shorter correlation lengths perpendicular versus parallel to $\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, revealing nanoscale rotational and translational symmetry breaking analogous to the cuprate and Fe-based superconductors, with possible Bloch-like antiferromagnetic domain walls separating orthogonal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures; replaced with published version.

In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

The realization of superconductivity in thin films requires delicate control of growth conditions, which presents significant challenges in the synthesis process. Furthermore, the stability of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ films is compromised by oxygen loss, which complicates their characterization. We introduce an effective recycling protocol that involves oxygen removal in a precursor phase followed by ozone-assisted annealing, which restores superconducting properties. By tuning the oxygen content, we construct an electronic phase diagram that highlights oxygen addition as a potential analogue to hole doping via La substitution with Sr, providing insights into the doping mechanism and guiding future material optimization.</p></details> |  |

Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the presence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset temperatures at $\sim$140 K and $\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity measurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\rm SDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic nematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge order. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to approximately 70 K. These compelling experimental observations provide critical insights into the coexistence and manipulability of density wave phenomena in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, laying a foundation for future research into their optical control.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding the interplay between the associated density wave (DW) fluctuations and superconductivity, as well as the orbital character and symmetry underlying the DW instabilities. Here we utilize polarized Raman scattering to investigate the phononic and electronic Raman responses of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ across its concomitant charge and spin density wave transitions. In addition to distinct phonon anomalies occurring below the transition temperature, we observe a depletion of continuum spectral weight up to 114 meV and a pronounced peak centered at this energy. By combining momentum-selective information from polarized electronic Raman scattering with model calculations involving both Ni-3$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, we identify 114 meV as the energy scale $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ of the DW gap, characterized by incoherent opening and non-mean-field behavior. Furthermore, the model calculations reveal that the corresponding $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ peak exhibits a multiorbital origin, thus shedding light on the nature of the DW instabilities in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$.</p></details> |  |

This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages, 5 figures with Appendix</p></details> |

However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cells limits spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa where structural transition appears. In addition, the observation of a single density wave gap indicates that the spin density wave and charge density wave remain coupled as pressure increases, rather than decoupling. After the density wave collapse, a distinct low-temperature regime emerges, characterized by a small gap consistent with potential superconducting pairing. The separated phase region of superconductivity and density waves suggests that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pairing without $γ$-Pocket in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20287v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film at ambient pressure has aroused great research interest. The $\gamma$-pocket formed by the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band, which was previously proposed to be crucial in the pairing mechanism of pressurized bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, is reported to be either present or absent here by different experimental groups, giving rise to the problem: what is the pairing mechanism and pairing nature without the $\gamma$-pocket? Here, we start from a band structure obtained via density-functional-theoretical calculation, which exhibits no $\gamma$-pocket. Then, equipped with electron interactions, we study the pairing nature via combined weak- and strong- coupling approaches, which provide consistent results. In the weak-coupling study, the nesting between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$- pockets leads to an $s^\pm$-wave pairing in which the gap signs on the two pockets are opposite, as provided by our random-phase-approximation based calculations. In real-space, the pairing pattern is dominated by the interlayer pairing of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong-coupling study, as the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals are nearly half-filled and hence localized, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals carry the HTSC. Driven by the interlayer superexchange transferred from the $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the Hund's rule coupling, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital electrons form interlayer $s$-wave pairing, as suggested by our slave-boson-mean-field study on the related two-orbital $t$-$J$ model. Projected onto the Fermi surface, this pairing just gives the $s^\pm$-wave pattern consistent with that obtained in the weak-coupling study. Our result is consistent with that obtained in recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment.</p></details> |  |

The $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are found to shift down with correlation while their Fermi surfaces become highly damped and cannot to be resolved experimentally. In contrast, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fermi surfaces do not vary much with correlation and they are sharp enough to be detected in experiments. The spin susceptibility peaks at a wave vector in the odd channel, connecting the symmetric $\gamma$ band and the asymmetric $\delta$ band. The superconducting pairing symmetry is robustly $s$-wave and the $\delta$ band has the largest pairing magnitude. All the findings suggest a dominant role of the $3d_{z^{2}}$ orbital in this material.</p></details> |  |

We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states around the $\Gamma$ point, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations due to Fermi surface nesting of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states near the interface. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

We systematically investigate the band structures and electronic correlation effect to identify the key factors controlling superconductivity and pathways to enhance $T_c$. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct a bilayer two-orbital ($3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$) tight-binding model for a series of in-plane compression mimicking the substrate effect. We find the band energy at the $M$ point drops with the compression, leading to increase of the density of states at the Fermi level, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk under pressure. We then apply functional renormalization group (FRG) method to study the electronic correlation effect on the superconductivity. We find the $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust in the films, the same as the bulk. But somewhat surprisingly, for the films, we find $T_c$ can be enhanced by reducing the in-plane lattice constant, increasing the out-of-plane lattice constant, or further electron-doping. These findings are consistent with the itinerant picture of the superconductivity induced by spin-fluctuations and provide theoretical support for further boosting $T_c$ in future experiments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule. These results suggest that the normal state of La3Ni2O7 to be a multiband metallic nature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15906v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a trilayer two $E_g$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to investigate the microscopic origin of SC in this system. In the strong-coupling regime, each layer is governed by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with intra-layer antiferromagnetic exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons are allowed to hop between layers, interacting via inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. The inner-layer $3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons tends to form bonding states with those in the neighboring layers, leading to redistribution of the electron densities. The numerical simulation results indicate that SC is predominantly mediated by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, characterized by an intra-layer extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, accompanied by an inter-layer pairing with opposite sign. Furthermore, we find that electron doping enhances SC, while hole doping tends to suppress it. These findings provide new insights into the SC mechanisms of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its sensitivity to charge doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incommensurate spin-fluctuations and competing pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05254v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</p></details> | 21 pages. 17 figures |

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18564v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Revealing isotropic abundant low-energy excitations in UTe$_2$ through complex microwave surface impedance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07955v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex surface impedance is a well-established tool to study the super- and normal-fluid responses of superconductors. Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $\Delta \lambda(T) \sim T^\alpha$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $\alpha < 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{\alpha_R}$ with $\alpha_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.</p></details> | 29 pages, 23 figures |

This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state. Taking into account the large decrease in $K_a$ in the SC state, we conclude that the $\boldsymbol{d}$ vector has components along all three crystal axes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 Figures + Supplemental Material with 18 pages, 16 Figures</p></details> |

We have investigated the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition in high-quality crystals of UTe$_2$ by tracking its signature in the magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$. A single, sharp superconducting transition is observed at low pressures 0.3 GPa. At higher pressure, a second feature emerges in $\chi(T)$, which is located at the lower-temperature thermodynamic phase boundary previously identified in specific heat measurements. This second transition anomaly in $\chi(T)$ can be attributed to a step change in the London penetration depth, providing direct evidence for a change in the superconducting order parameter of UTe$_2$. Thermodynamic constraints suggest that the low temperature, high pressure superconducting state is distinct from zero pressure superconductivity as well as from the high pressure, high temperature superconducting state, raising the possibility of multicomponent superconductivity in high pressure UTe$_2$.</p></details> |  |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |

The surface flat bands originate from topological features supported by two key mechanisms: (1) a trivial Chern number prevents the zero-energy states from merging into the continuum of the bulk spectrum, thereby ensuring their confinement within the superconducting gap; and (2) weak spin conservation allows the gap function to exhibit phase winding. As a consequence, the surface exhibits a remarkably high density of states at nearly zero energy. Such surface states are likely to be realized in the candidate topological superconductor UTe$_2$. Our results provide important insights into the interpretation of recent Josephson STM experiments on UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 5 pages + 9 pages |

The strong, non-perturbative influence of the magnetic field complicates the determination of superconducting order parameters in the high-field phases. Here, we report electronic transport anisotropy measurements in precisely aligned microbars in magnetic fields to 45 T applied along the b-axis. Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter. A pair-density-wave-like state at high fields could naturally induce a layered modulation of the superfluid density, forming planar structures that confine vortices and guide their sliding in the flux-flow regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surface charge density wave in UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12505v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</p></details> |  |

Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+17...</summary><p>11+17 pages, 4+14 figures. v2: Discussions added with minor changes in the acknowledgement</p></details> |

In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional charged Andreev bound states in a superconductor with a sublattice degree of freedom, where the sign of charge density of the Andreev bound states oscillates between the two sublattices. The oscillating-charged Andreev bound states lead to a complete breakdown of the proportionality among the electron part of the spectral function, the local density of states, and the tunneling conductance spectrum for energies below the superconducting gap. We also discuss the possible occurrence of these Andreev bound states in UTe$_2$ and locally noncentrosymmetric superconductors.</p></details> |  |

However, a comprehensive understanding of the topological phases in the superconducting states of UTe$_2$ is still lacking. Here, we present an exhaustive classification of topological phases for all time-reversal symmetry breaking pairing symmetries of UTe$_2$. Using the K theoretical classification approach, we uncover that 25 out of 36 possible pairing states are classified as higher-order topological phases, with some demonstrating hybrid-order topology through an intricate interplay of hinge and corner states. Furthermore, under the weak-coupling condition of the pair potentials, the possible pairing symmetries are constrained to $B_{ju} + i B_{ku}$, $A_{u} + i B_{j u}$, and $B_{j g} + iA_u$ ($j,k = 1,2,3$; $j \neq k$), where these symbols denote the irreducible representations of the point group $D_{2h}$. For these pairing states, the topological invariants are related to the Fermi surface topology via the Fermi-surface formula, enabling us to systematically diagnose higher-order topological phases. Using a tight-binding model, we demonstrate the higher-order topological phases of the mixed-parity $A_u + iB_{1g}$ superconductors, where the second-order and hybrid-order topological phases emerge as the number of Fermi surfaces enclosing the time-reversal invariant momentum evolves from two to four. The findings suggest that UTe$_2$ serves as a compelling platform for exploring higher-order topological superconductors with diverse topological surface states.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

Its surface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we propose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface and in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual features detected by surface probes in this material. Through a phenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental signatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of CDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii) the magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the CDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature and its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental checks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |

Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagom\'e lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagom\'e lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagom\'e metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagom\'e lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09316v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity in a Chern band: effect of time-reversal-symmetry breaking on superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16508v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-reversal-symmetry breaking is generally understood to be detrimental for superconductivity. However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120{\deg}, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Fate of chiral order and impurity self-pinning in flat bands with local symmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01780v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interacting bosons on a single plaquette threaded by a $\pi$-flux can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a chiral loop current. Connecting such bosonic $\pi$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $\pi$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04601v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loop current order on the kagome lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01648v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent discoveries in kagome materials have unveiled their capacity to harbor exotic quantum states, including intriguing charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+3 p...</summary><p>9+3 pages, 10 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect. The present theory predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity, which is significant to understand the cascade of quantum electron states in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

However, to our best knowledge, unconventional magnetic states driven by van Hove singularities--like spin-density waves--have not been observed experimentally in kagome metals. Here, we report the magnetic and electronic structure of the layered kagome metal CeTi3Bi4, where Ti kagome electronic structure interacts with a magnetic sublattice of Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments. Neutron diffraction reveals an incommensurate spin-density wave ground state of the Ce3+ moments, coexisting with commensurate antiferromagnetic order across most of the temperature-field phase diagram. The commensurate component is preferentially suppressed by thermal fluctuations and magnetic field, yielding a rich phase diagram involving an intermediate single-Q spin-density wave phase. First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy identify van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, with the observed magnetic propagation vectors connecting their high density of states, strongly suggesting a van Hove singularity-assisted spin-density wave.

Weak-coupling analyses and mean field calculations have demonstrated that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_2$ drives, respectively, real and imaginary bond-ordered CDW, with the latter corresponding to time-reversal symmetry breaking loop current CDW. It is important to understand the inter-layer correlation of these bond-ordered CDWs and its consequences in the bulk kagom\'e materials. To provide physical insights, we investigate in this paper the $c$-axis stacking of them, loop current CDW in particular, on the minimal bilayer kagom\'e lattice. The bare susceptibilities for stacking of real and imaginary bond orders are calculated for the free electrons on the bilayer kagom\'e lattice with inter-layer coupling $t_\perp=0.2t$, which splits the van Hove filling to $n_{+\text{vH}}=4.64/12$ and $n_{-\text{vH}}=5.44/12$. While real and imaginary bond-ordered CDWs are still favored, respectively, by $V_1$ and $V_2$, their inter-layer coupling is sensitive to band filling $n$. They tend to stack symmetrically near $n_{\pm\text{vH}}$ with identical bond orders in the two layers and give rise to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 1c_0$ CDW. On the other hand, they prefer to stack antisymmetrically around $n_\text{vH}$ with opposite bond orders in the two layers and lead to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 2c_0$ CDW. The concrete bilayer $t$-$t_\perp$-$V_1$-V$_2$ model is then studied. We obtain the mean-field ground states and determine the inter-layer coupling as a function of band filling at various interactions.

The estimated magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 10$a$ ($a$ is the lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) above the surface could be in the order of 100mT; thus, they may be detectable by currently available detection methods. Next, we investigate the use of them as qubits (the ``SVILC qubits'') in an architecture composed of three nano-islands of the thin film; and consider the use of the detection of the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs as the qubit readout. We show there are a number of energy levels suitable for qubit states that can be manipulated by external current feeding, and the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs is large enough to be used for the readout.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasiparticle Spectroscopy of Chiral Charge Order](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19032v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic interactions can give rise to novel charge density waves with unconventional ground states. Recent experiments report evidence for a chiral charge density wave (CDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb or Cs). Theoretical analyses propose a topologically nontrivial loop current phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry as the favorable CDW ground state. However, spectroscopic insights into the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds are still missing and conflicting experimental results question the presence of a loop current phase. We employed individual magnetic atoms as local quantum sensors to examine the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Our spectroscopic measurements show that the magnetic moment of Co induces a spatially-localized low-energy state in the CDW phase. The distinct spectral signatures of this state are consistent with theoretical expectations for the quasiparticle excitation of a loop current order parameter, while control experiment rule out alternative scenario. Our work provides unique insights into the ground state of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and introduces a novel method to examine other topological states, such as the fractional Chern insulators, with the STM.</p></details> |  |

A key feature of this CDW phase is a non-monotonic Hall effect at low fields, often attributed to TRS breaking. However, its origin remains unclear. Here, we conduct comprehensive magnetotransport measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and, through mobility spectrum analysis, identify the formation of tiny Fermi pockets with extremely high mobility below the CDW transition. Furthermore, electron irradiation experiments reveal that the non-monotonic Hall effect is significantly suppressed in samples with reduced mobility, despite no substantial change in the electronic structure. These results indicate that the non-monotonic Hall effect originates from these tiny Fermi pockets with high mobility carriers rather than anomalous Hall mechanisms, providing new insights into understanding the Hall anomaly in this kagome system.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, Supplemental Material</p></details> |

Recently, Aizpurua et al. demonstrated explainable anomaly detection with matrix product states on a discrete-valued cyber-security task, using quantum-inspired methods to gain insight into the learned model and detected anomalies. Here, we extend this framework to real-valued data domains. We furthermore introduce tree tensor networks for the task of explainable anomaly detection. We demonstrate these methods with three benchmark problems, show adequate predictive performance compared to several baseline models and both tensor network architectures' ability to explain anomalous samples. We thereby extend the application of tensor networks to a broader class of potential problems and open a pathway for future extensions to more complex tensor network architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Accepted for publication at IEEE QAI 2025</p></details> |

In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.</p></details> | 6+2 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Thermal Hall transport in Kitaev spin liquids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16558v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^{\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\Gamma$ and negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\Gamma^\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials.</p></details> | 26 pages, 26 figures |
| **[Probing Non-Fermi-Liquid Behaviour of Composite Fermi Liquid via Efficient Thermal Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02218v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field, i.e., the quantum Hall system, is remarkably rich. At half filling of the lowest Landau level, it has been predicted that ``composite fermions'' -- emergent quasiparticle of an electron with two magnetic flux quanta -- can experience zero net magnetic field and form a Fermi sea, dubbed composite Fermi liquid (CFL). However, the seemingly simple appearance of CFL is a strongly correlated quantum many-body state in disguise, and to solve it in a controlled manner is extremely difficult, to the level that the thermodynamic properties of CFL is still largely unknown. In this work, we perform state-of-the-art thermal tensor network simulations on the $\nu=1/2$ Landau level systems, and observe low-temperature power-law behaviour of the specific heat, signaling the gapless nature of CFL. More importantly, the power is extracted to be closed to $2/3$, clearly deviated from the ordinary linear-$T$ Fermi liquid behaviour, suggesting the coupling between the CFs and the dynamical emergent gauge field and therefore revealed the quantum many-body aspect of the CFL state. Relevance of our methodology to other quantum Hall settings and moir\'e systems is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+3 p...</summary><p>7+3 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

Here, we establish a method to compute local topological invariants of exceptionally large systems using tensor networks, enabling the computation of invariants for Hamiltonians with hundreds of millions of sites, several orders of magnitude above the capabilities of conventional methodologies. Our approach leverages a tensor-network representation of the density matrix using a Chebyshev tensor network algorithm, enabling large-scale calculations of topological markers in quasicrystalline and moire systems. We demonstrate our methodology with two-dimensional quasicrystals featuring $C_8$ and $C_{10}$ rotational symmetries and mosaics of Chern phases. Our work establishes a powerful method to compute topological phases in exceptionally large-scale topological systems, providing the required tool to rationalize generic supe-moire and quasicrystalline topological matter.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Systematic construction of stabilizer codes via gauging abelian boundary symmetries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09044v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a systematic framework to construct a (d+1)-dimensional stabilizer model from an initial generic d-dimensional abelian symmetry. Our approach builds upon the iterative gauging procedure, developed by one of the authors in [J. Garre-Rubio, Nature Commun. 15, 7986 (2024)], in which an initial symmetric state is repeatedly gauged to obtain an emergent model in one dimension higher that supports the initial symmetry at its boundary. This method not only enables the construction of emergent states and corresponding commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians of which they are ground states, but it also provides a way to construct gapped boundary conditions for these models that amount to spontaneously breaking part of the boundary symmetry. In a detailed introductory example, we showcase our paradigm by constructing three-dimensional Clifford-deformed surface codes from iteratively gauging a global 0-form symmetry that lives in two dimensions. We then provide a proof of our main result, hereby drawing upon a slight extension of the gauging procedure of Williamson. We additionally provide two more examples in d=2 in which different type-I fracton orders emerge from gauging initial linear subsystem and Sierpinski fractal symmetries. En passant, we provide explicit tensor network representations of all of the involved gauging maps and the emergent states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Tensor Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11091v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic complexity of dot-product attention introduced in Transformer remains a fundamental bottleneck impeding the progress of foundation models toward unbounded context lengths. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a new architectural framework that fundamentally reformulates attention by unifying the expressive power of tensor algebra with neural network design. Our approach moves beyond both conventional dot-product attention and subsequent linear-time approximations to capture higher-order statistical dependencies. We introduce two core operators derived from this framework: \emph{Tensor Attention}, which models complex token-mixing via data-dependent polynomial kernels, and Tensor Interaction, a novel mechanism for adaptive channel-mixing. We demonstrate that these operators are powered by second-order summaries that entirely bypass the formation of $n \times n$ matrices, enabling a causality-preserving streaming implementation with $O(d^2)$ per-token updates and $O(d^2)$ state. This efficiency rivals that of modern State Space Models while retaining an attention-like formulation. The Deep Tensor Network thus provides a principled and powerful new class of building blocks for next-generation sequence models, bridging the gap between scalable computation and rich, expressive interaction modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00456v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial complexity of open quantum system problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00424v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open quantum systems (OQS's) are ubiquitous in non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and in quantum science and technology. Solving the dynamics of an OQS in a quantum many-body bath has been considered a computationally hard problem because of the dimensionality curse. Here, considering that full knowledge of the bath dynamics is unnecessary for describing the reduced dynamics of an OQS, we prove a polynomial complexity theorem, that is, the number of independent equations required to fully describe the dynamics of an OQS increases at most linearly with the evolution time and polynomially with the bath size. Therefore, efficient computational algorithms exist for solving the dynamics of a small-sized OQS (such as a qubit or an atom). We further prove that, when the dynamics of an OQS and the bath is represented by a tensor network, a tensor contraction procedure can be specified such that the bond dimension (i.e., the range of tensor indices contracted in each step) increases only linearly (rather than exponentially) with the evolution time, providing explicitly efficient algorithms for a wide range of OQS's. We demonstrate the theorems and the tensor-network algorithm by solving two widely encountered OQS problems, namely, a spin in a Gaussian bath (the spin-boson model) and a central spin coupled to many environmental spins (the Gaudin model). This work provides approaches to understanding dynamics of OQS's, learning the environments via quantum sensors, and optimizing quantum information processing in noisy environments.</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Large Qubit Array based Quantum Sensor Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21253v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation (MPS) for scalable circuit optimization for optimizing quantum sensor circuits with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS) representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the 0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Simulating Quantum Circuits with Tree Tensor Networks using Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16718v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). The framework employs a variational compression scheme that optimizes the TTN to approximate the evolved quantum state. To benchmark the method, we simulate random circuits and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a naive TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that the DMRG algorithm with TTNs provides a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.</p></details> | 14 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Quantum algorithms for equational reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21122v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce quantum normal form reduction, a quantum computational framework for analyzing abstract symbolic expressions - such as strings, algebraic formulas, or quantum circuits - that are equivalent under a given set of transformation rules. These rules form a term rewriting system, a formal method for deriving equivalences by repeatedly applying substitutions. We construct an efficiently implementable quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the entire class of equivalent expressions - potentially exponentially many - in a quantum superposition. By preparing and manipulating these ground states, we address fundamental problems in equational reasoning, including the word problem, i.e., determining whether two expressions are equivalent, counting the number of equivalent expressions, and identifying structural properties of equivalence classes. We demonstrate a quantum-inspired version of the algorithm using tensor network simulations by solving instances involving up to $10^{28}$ equivalent expressions, well beyond the reach of standard classical graph exploration techniques. This framework opens the path for quantum symbolic computation in areas ranging from quantum and logical circuit design to data compression, computational group theory, linguistics, polymers and biomolecular modeling, enabling the investigation of problems previously out of reach.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Here we establish a machine learning strategy to extract the parameters of a spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows us to extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that predicts the Hamiltonian parameters of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable us to learn a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, supplementary information</p></details> |
| **[Direct probing of the simulation complexity of open quantum many-body dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19959v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating open quantum systems is key to understanding non-equilibrium processes, as persistent influence from the environment induces dissipation and can give rise to steady-state phase transitions. A common strategy is to embed the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters, correlation length and mixing time, and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge theories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16301v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.</p></details> |  |
| **[Numerical Optimization for Tensor Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19409v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide compact and scalable representations of high-dimensional data, enabling efficient computation in fields such as quantum physics, numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), and machine learning. This paper focuses on tensor disentangling, the task of identifying transformations that reduce bond dimensions by exploiting gauge freedom in the network. We formulate this task as an optimization problem over orthogonal matrices acting on a single tensor's indices, aiming to minimize the rank of its matricized form. We present Riemannian optimization methods and a joint optimization framework that alternates between optimizing the orthogonal transformation for a fixed low-rank approximation and optimizing the low-rank approximation for a fixed orthogonal transformation, offering a competitive alternative when the target rank is known. To seek the often unknown optimal rank, we introduce a binary search strategy integrated with the disentangling procedure. Numerical experiments on random tensors and tensors in an approximate isometric tensor network state are performed to compare different optimization methods and explore the possibility of combining different methods in a hybrid approach.</p></details> |  |

The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J>0$): a \textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to $0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to $0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J<0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J<0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The abstract is shortened.

We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore, strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Quantum Dynamics for Robust and Scalable Quantum Extreme Learning Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05535v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) is an emerging hybrid quantum machine learning framework that leverages quantum system dynamics to enhance classical models. However, QELM can suffer from the exponential concentration problem, where excessive entanglement reduces model expressivity. In this work, we gain insight into this challenge and demonstrate how tensor network methods specifically, the Time Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) with Matrix Product States (MPS) can efficiently simulate quantum systems while controlling entanglement and mitigating exponential concentration. Using numerical experiments on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, we show that time-evolving an MPS system modeled as a chain of Rydberg atoms produces high-quality data embeddings with low classical computational overhead. Our findings indicate that exact simulation of quantum dynamics is not necessary for strong machine learning performance; even approximate quantum embeddings can yield competitive results. Furthermore, we observe that both increased disorder in the quantum state achieved by tuning Hamiltonian parameters and careful control of entanglement directly correlate with improved model accuracy, highlighting the importance of these factors in optimizing QELM performance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</p></details> |  |

Here, we show that when the lattice has a fractal geometry with Hausdorff dimension 1.58, additional surprises appear. The system is described by a transverse-field Ising model with long-range van der Waals interactions in a Sierpi\`nski gasket fractal. We investigate the problem theoretically using exact diagonalization, variational mean field, quantum Monte Carlo, and a graph-based numerical technique, SIM-GRAPH, which we developed. We find that in the quantum regime, the phase diagram exhibits phases in which the spins flip one-by-one. The theoretical results are in excellent agreement with experiments performed with single 88Sr atoms trapped by optical tweezers arranged in a fractal geometry. The magnetization and von Neumann entanglement entropy reveal several regimes in which single spin-flips are delocalized over many sites of one sublattice, thus allowing for an unprecedented control of a cascade of phase transitions in a manybody system. These results expand the possibilities of Rydberg atoms for quantum information processing and may have profound implications in quantum technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main article: 32 pages, 4 figures, 8 extended data figures.

We study the lightly doped Hofstadter-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice through large-scale density matrix renormalization group and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find strong evidence for a robust chiral superconducting (SC) phase with dominant power-law pairing correlations and a quantized spin Chern number. The SC phase emerges at very weak interaction and grows stronger at intermediate interaction strengths (U ) for a wide range of hole doping. We also discuss the possible distinct nature of the normal state in different U regimes. Our work provides theoretical insights into the emergence of topological superconductivity from doping topological Chern bands or magnetic flux induced chiral spin liquid states of Moir\'e materials.</p></details> |  |

Here we discover its conceptual counterpart, i.e., a symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition. It emerges from a one-dimensional realization of deconfined criticality between charge- and bond-ordered states driven by competing Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon couplings, for which quantum fluctuations and thereby the nature of the transition can be tuned systematically via the phonon frequency $\omega_0$. In the classical limit $\omega_0 \to 0$, a low-energy Dirac theory predicts a direct first-order transition with emergent U(1) symmetry. Using exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide strong evidence for symmetry enhancement and even finite-size scaling on intermediate length scales but in the thermodynamic limit it turns into a narrow intermediate phase where both order parameters are finite, as chiral U(1) symmetry is weakly broken on the lattice. Including quantum lattice fluctuations diminishes the width of the intermediate phase, gradually restores the U(1) symmetry, and eventually tunes the system to a deconfined quantum critical point.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

We present a joint theoretical and experimental exploration of possible signatures of fermion pairing with finite center-of-mass momentum, or the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) order. Experimentally a doped and spin-imbalanced attractive two-dimensional Hubbard model is realized with a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice, and quantum gas microscopy is used to probe its properties. Computationally we study the same model with state-of-the-art constrained-path (CP) auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Direct comparisons between experiment and computation on various short-range magnetic and charge correlations show excellent agreement. We then investigate these correlations, as well as pairing correlation functions, systematically to low temperatures with CP-AFQMC, and determine parameter regimes in density and magnetization where signatures of FFLO order may be observed. We show that the temperature at which precursors of such orders appear is already within reach of the current experiment. We discuss routes for direct experimental detection and measurements of such states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transient Dynamical Phase Diagram of the Spin-Boson Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02345v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo results for the real-time dynamics of the spin polarization in the sub-Ohmic spin--boson model at finite temperature. We focus in particular on the localization and coherence behavior of the model, extending our previous study at low temperature [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056502 (2025)]. As the temperature increases, the system becomes less localized and less coherent. The loss of coherence, which is controlled by two independent mechanisms -- a smooth damping-driven crossover and a sharp frequency-driven transition -- exhibits a nontrivial temperature dependence. While both types of coherence loss occur at lower coupling in the high temperature regime, the frequency exhibits a sharper drop at high temperatures and this drop is observed for all values of the sub-Ohmic exponent, in contrast to the zero-temperature case. We discuss the full temperature-dependent dynamical phase diagram of the system and the interplay between coherence and localization across a wide range of physical parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ancil...</summary><p>Ancillary data file included</p></details> |

Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use determinate quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulation to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages + Supplemental Material, 2 figures, added new determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations</p></details> |
| **[Reproducibility of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo across diverse community codes: The case of water-methane dimer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes-highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification of the transport regimes of the one-dimensional Holstein model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01335v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Holstein model is a benchmark model of systems with electron-phonon interaction. However, its electrical transport properties are not yet fully understood. In this work, we performed numerically exact calculations of imaginary-time current-current correlation function of the Holstein Hamiltonian for a broad range of model parameters. These calculations were performed using a path-integral based Quantum Monte Carlo method. We compared these results with the results obtained under the assumption of conventional band transport, small polaron hopping and polaron band transport. From this comparison we identified the regions in parameter space where each of these transport regimes is valid. In some cases when imaginary-time comparison of current-current correlation functions could not give conclusive results, we complemented them with real-time comparisons or the comparison with literature data on numerically exact dc mobilities. Overall, we found that the parameter space is almost completely covered by the three mentioned transport regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite-temperature quantum phases and phase transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00855v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we reveal nontrivial quantum physics in an infinite-temperature system. By performing an unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we study a hybrid model composed of hard-core bosons, whose hopping amplitude is mediated by the density of another type of soft-core bond bosons that can absorb entropy indefinitely. It is shown that the Bose-Einstein condensate can persist in three dimensions even when the temperature approaches the infinite-temperature limit. In contrast, in two dimensions, the quasi-superfluid is depleted by the fluctuations of the bond bosons, which, on the other hand, enhance the conductivity of the hard-core bosons in the normal phase. A generalization to the fermionic model has also been discussed.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Post-measurement Quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13844v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our 'post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and at first we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. We then study the effects of measuring the system in a basis where the standard (unmeasured) SSE is sign-free: For measurement schemes with this property, we can calculate correlations in all post-measurement states without a sign problem. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>19+2 ...</summary><p>19+2 pages.

| **[Quantum Monte Carlo Benchmarking of Molecular Adsorption on Graphene-Supported Single Pt Atom](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21339v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise understanding of adsorption energetics and molecular geometry at catalytic sites is fundamental for advancing catalysis, particularly under the constraints of resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study benchmarks the performance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations against diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for adsorption properties of small gas molecules relevant to CO oxidation -- namely O$_2$, CO, CO$_2$, and atomic oxygen -- on a single Pt atom supported by pristine graphene. Our findings reveal that DMC calculations provide a significantly different landscape of adsorption energetics compared to DFT results. Notably, DFT predicts different lowest-energy configurations and spin states, particularly for O$_2$, which suggests potential discrepancies in predicting the catalytic behavior. Furthermore, this study identifies the critical issue of CO poisoning, highlighted by the large disparity between the DMC adsorption energies of O$_2$ ($-1.23(2)$ eV) and CO ($-3.37(1)$ eV), which can inhibit the catalytic process. These results emphasize the necessity for more sophisticated computational approaches in catalysis research, aiming to refine the prediction accuracy of reaction mechanisms and to enhance the design of more effective catalysts.</p></details> |  |
| **[A phenomenological universal expression for the condensate fraction in strongly-correlated two-dimensional Bose gases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19615v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the relation between non-local and energetic properties in 2D quantum systems of zero-temperature bosons. By analyzing numerous interaction potentials across densities spanning from perturbative to strongly correlated regime, we discover a novel high-precision quantum phenomenological universality: the condensate fraction can be expressed through kinetic energy and quantum energy, defined as total energy relative to classical crystal state. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations accurately validate our analytical expression. Furthermore, we test the obtained relation on the fundamental example of a non-perturbative system, namely, the liquid helium. The proposed relation is relevant to experiments with excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) materials, as well as ultracold atoms and other quantum systems in reduced dimensionality.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Toward improved property prediction of 2D materials using many-body quantum Monte Carlo methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02753v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of two-dimensional (2D) materials has grown dramatically in the last two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computation applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals (vdW) materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. In order to overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest including graphene, phosphorene, MoS$_2$, CrI$_3$, VSe$_2$, GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graphene-hBN interlayer interactions from quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13672v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interaction between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and structural properties of graphene-based devices. In this work, we employ quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to study the interlayer interactions and stacking-fault energy (SFE) between graphene and hBN. We generated QMC energies for several rigid bilayer stacking configurations and fitted these data to the Kolmogorov-Crespi type interlayer potential (ILP) model. Our QMC-derived potential offers a more reliable alternative to conventional density functional theory methods, which are prone to errors in predicting properties in van der Waals materials. This study enables highly accurate predictions of structural and electronic properties in graphene hBN heterostructures. The resulting ILP-QMC potential is made available for further use in simulating complex systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) on hBN.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations or high-temperature expansion series complemented with the entropy method. We also discuss a recent proposal about hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

In QSCI/SQD a quantum circuit is repeatedly prepared on the quantum device, and measured configurations form a subspace of the many-body Hilbert space in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized classically. For the dissociation of N$_2$ and a model $\mathrm{[2Fe-2S]}$ cluster (correlating 10 electrons in 26 orbitals and 30 electrons in 20 orbitals, respectively) we show that a non-perturbative stochastic approach, phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), using truncated SQD trial wavefunctions obtained from quantum hardware can recover a substantial amount (e.g., O(100) mHa) of correlation energy and alleviate the possible sampling redundancy of the QSCI/SQD procedure. Extrapolation of the ph-AFQMC energy versus the energy variance of the SQD trial wavefunctions has the potential to further improve the energy accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>15+4 ...</summary><p>15+4 pages, 10+7 figures</p></details> |

It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised machine learning, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions. Additionally, we conduct a regression task to predict superfluid density, which reflects non-local properties of the quantum system, and achieve good accuracy. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Finally, using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the machine learning models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable input format for machine learning in quantum many-body physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 23 figures, revised version with new results including transfer learning and interpretability</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the nuclear shell model by the complex Langevin method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15116v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nuclear shell model is known to describe the properties of various nuclei extremely well. However, the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations cannot be applied to it with general interactions due to the sign problem. The model has therefore been investigated primarily by variational methods, where the accuracy of the results depends crucially on the ansatz for the wave function. Here we perform the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the case of small systems at finite temperature using the complex Langevin method (CLM), which has been successfully applied to various interesting systems with the sign problem over the decade. In particular, we show the existence of a parameter region in which the validity criterion for the CLM is satisfied and the expectation value of the energy obtained by exact diagonalization is correctly reproduced. Thus the CLM can be a complementary approach to the variational method for large systems.</p></details> | 19 pages, 12 figures |

We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.</p></details> |  |

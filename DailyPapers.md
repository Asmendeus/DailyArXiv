| **[Simulating superconductivity in mixed-dimensional $t_\parallel$-${J}_\parallel$-${J}_\perp$ bilayers with neural quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10091v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, we study a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t_\parallel$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model, which has been proposed as an effective low-energy description of LNO. Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\times 8\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + Supplementary Materials</p></details> |
| **[Magneto-optical study of Nb thin films for superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10010v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among the recognized sources of decoherence in superconducting qubits, the spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting state and the possible presence of magnetic-flux vortices remain comparatively underexplored. Niobium is commonly used as a structural material in transmon qubits that host Josephson junctions, and excess dissipation anywhere in the transmon can become a bottleneck that limits overall quantum performance. The metal/substrate interfacial layer may simultaneously host pair-breaking loss channels (e.g., two-level systems, TLS) and control thermal transport, thereby affecting dissipation and temperature stability. Here, we use quantitative magneto-optical imaging of the magnetic-flux distribution to characterize the homogeneity of the superconducting state and the critical current density, $j_{c}$, in niobium films fabricated under different sputtering conditions. The imaging reveals distinct flux-penetration regimes, ranging from a nearly ideal Bean critical state to strongly nonuniform thermo-magnetic dendritic avalanches. By fitting the measured magnetic-induction profiles, we extract $j_{c}$ and correlate it with film physical properties and with measured qubit internal quality factors. Our results indicate that the Nb/Si interlayer can be a significant contributor to decoherence and should be considered an important factor that must be optimized.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Dome in $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-δ}$ Thin Films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15284v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ambient-pressure superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the phase diagram and reveal the superconducting dome with an electron-hole crossover in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-δ}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content. The maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$) coincides with an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.</p></details> | 33 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Pressure dependent topological, superconducting, optoelectronic and thermophysical properties of Ta2Se chalcogenide: Theoretical insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09727v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tetragonal Ta2Se is a layered, Ta-rich chalcogenide that departs from conventional MX2 transition-metal dichalcogenides by hosting dense Ta-Ta networks capped by Se square-net layers. Here, we present a unified first-principles investigation of hydrostatic-pressure tuning in Ta2Se from 0 to 10 GPa, connecting the structural response, mechanical stability, thermophysical indicators, bonding evolution, electronic and optical behavior, lattice dynamics and superconductivity within a single framework. The derived thermophysical descriptors corroborate a pressure-stiffened lattice: density increases, Debye temperature rises, melting temperature is elevated and minimum thermal conductivity increases, whereas the Grüneisen parameter remains within a narrow window, suggesting no anomalous anharmonic softening. Bond population metrics and electron-density-difference analysis revealed a mixed metallic-covalent bonding picture dominated by a robust Ta-Ta metallic backbone, accompanied by pressure-strengthened Ta-Se hybridization. Electronic-structure calculations show persistent metallicity under compression; pressure broadens bands, reduces density of states at the Fermi level, reshapes the Fermi surface and points to a possible Lifshitz-type reconstruction without symmetry breaking. The optical response remained metallic with Drude-like low-energy behavior and pressure-tunable spectral features. The phonon dispersions exhibit no imaginary modes, confirming dynamical stability. Electron-phonon coupling calculations classify Ta2Se as a weak-coupling, phonon-mediated superconductor with Tc around 3.9 K, consistent with available experiments and establish pressure as a practical control knob for stability and superconductivity-relevant descriptors in this metal-rich layered platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pressure-induced superconductivity beyond magnetic quantum criticality in a Kondo ferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09654v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum phase transitions are an established setting for emergent phenomena driven by strong electronic correlations, including strange metals and unconventional superconductivity. These have been explored extensively in Kondo lattice materials tuned to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point (QCP), but superconductivity emerging near ferromagnetic quantum criticality is not yet observed, and the conditions under which it occurs in proximity to ferromagnetism are undetermined. Here, we report a new setting for superconductivity in the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice material Ce5CoGe2, where there is a ferromagnetic ground state at ambient pressure, which evolves to antiferromagnetism under applied pressures. The antiferromagnetic transition is suppressed to a zero-temperature QCP, which is accompanied by strange-metal behavior. Superconductivity does not occur at the QCP, but instead appears at pressures beyond the magnetic instability. These findings suggest that Ce5CoGe2 represents a distinct class of correlated materials exhibiting a unique scenario for the emergence of superconductivity, likely associated with unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optical conductivity signatures of strong correlations and multiband superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09567v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, there have been extensive efforts to unravel their electronic structure and pairing mechanism. In particular, understanding how the electronic structure evolves with doping is essential for clarifying theoretical models of superconductivity in nickelates. Here we present studies of the optical conductivity of Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films spanning the full phase diagram 0.025 < x < 0.30 using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The data are consistent with a two-band Drude model, which allows the decomposition of the intraband response into distinct contributions. One is from a "narrow" Drude term which we associate with electron bands, and the other a "broad" Drude term linked to the hole band with strong correlations. Increasing Sr doping leads to an expansion of the hole band spectral weight, and a corresponding reduction in the electron band, indicative of the multiband electronic structure and a doping-dependent reconstruction of the Fermi surface. Both doping and temperature-dependent optical spectra display significant spectral weight transfer from high to low energy, a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. In the superconducting state at optimal doping (x = 0.15), both electron and hole bands contribute to the superconducting condensate, signifying multiband superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 45 references</p></details> |
| **[Fluorine-substitution-dependent phase diagram and superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictides synthesized by a high-pressure growth technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05177v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples (x = 0.05 to 0.40) are synthesized by an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure technique at 4 GPa and systematically characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. Structural analysis confirms that the tetragonal Sm1111 phase remains dominant across the entire substitution range, with lattice parameters decreasing smoothly as fluorine content increases, demonstrating effective incorporation of F even in the overdoped regime (x = 0.4). Raman spectroscopy provides complementary, local-phase-sensitive evidence that supports the structural analysis and confirms fluorine substitution in the main Sm1111 phase. In the underdoped region, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude compared with conventionally synthesized samples at the ambient pressure. The upper critical field, estimated using the WHH model, reaches values approaching 200 T, reflecting strong paramagnetic limitation and multiband effects. TAFF analysis reveals a power-law field dependence of the activation energy, consistent with collective vortex pinning in polycrystalline iron-based superconductors. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. Comparison with conventionally synthesized Sm1111 samples demonstrates that high-pressure growth significantly extends the effective fluorine substitution range and enhances the superconducting performance, particularly in the underdoped regime. These results establish high-pressure fluorine substitution as an effective materials-engineering approach for tuning the phase diagram and optimizing the superconducting properties of Sm1111.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures Accepted for publication in "Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics"</p></details> |
| **[A cavity-mediated reconfigurable coupling scheme for superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08869v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting qubits have achieved remarkable progress in gate fidelity and coherence, yet their typical nearest-neighbor connectivity presents constraints for implementing complex quantum circuits. Here, we introduce a cavity-mediated coupling architecture in which a shared cavity mode, accessed through tunable qubit-cavity couplers, enables dynamically reconfigurable interactions between non-adjacent qubits. By selectively activating the couplers, we demonstrate that high-fidelity iSWAP and CZ gates can be performed within 50 ns with simulated coherent error below $10^{-4}$, while residual $ZZ$ interaction during idling remains below a few kilohertz. Extending to a four-qubit system, we also simulate gates between every qubit pair by selectively enabling the couplers with low qubit crosstalk. This approach provides a practical route toward enhanced interaction flexibility in superconducting quantum processors and may serve as a useful building block for devices that benefit from selective non-local coupling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Josephson tunneling through a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state: Interplay of $π$-shifts in Josephson current and local superconducting order parameter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08827v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An impurity hosting a magnetic moment coupled to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor gives rise to so-called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states with energies inside the superconducting gap. Depending on the coupling between the impurity and the superconductor, the system can have two distinct quantum ground states separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). We investigate the interplay of two effects observed at the QPT. First, the tunneling supercurrent through the impurity reverses its sign at the QPT, denoted as a $π$-shift in the current-phase relation. Secondly, the local superconducting order parameter at the impurity site is suppressed and becomes negative at the QPT, generally termed a $π$-shift in the local superconducting order parameter. We find that both these effects are governed by the presence of the YSR state, however, they do not significantly depend or influence each other. In particular, we establish that the $π$-shift in the superconducting order parameter does not induce a $π$-shift in the tunneling Josephson current, nor can the Josephson current and its spatial behavior be used to directly probe the impurity-induced changes in the local superconducting order parameter, which occur on a length scale substantially shorter than the superconducting coherence length.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconducting Spin-Singlet QuBit in a Triangulene Spin Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23928v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-1 chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we identify a manifold consisting of the two lowest-lying, spin-singlet states isolated from doublet states of opposite fermion parity, which undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random Zeeman and/or spin-orbit coupling. Despite the unavoidable effect of quasiparticle poisoning on qubit performance, the isolation of the singlet states offers additional protection. In addition, we introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Charging Advantage in Superconducting Solid-State Batteries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08610v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum battery, as a novel energy storage device, offers the potential for unprecedented efficiency and performance beyond the capabilities of classical systems, with broad implications for future quantum technologies. Here, we experimentally \RefC{demonstrate quantum charging advantage (QCA)} in a scalable solid-state quantum battery. More specifically, we show how double-excitation Hamiltonians for two-level systems promote scalable QCA \RefB{with standard methods.} We effectively implement the collective evolution of quantum systems with 2 up to 12 battery cells in a superconducting quantum processor, and study the performance of quantum charging compared to its uncorrelated classical counterpart. The model considered is a linear chain of superconducting transmon qubits with only \textit{nearest-neighbor} and \textit{pairwise} interactions, which constitute the simplest model of a multi-cell quantum battery. Our results empirically realize substantial QCA without the necessity of adopting long-range and many-body interactions \RefB{ and showcase the quantum features of the QB charging processes with measurements of non-zero coherent ergotropy, incoherent ergotropy and entanglement,} revealing a promising prospect for further developments of efficient and experimentally feasible protocols for QCA.</p></details> |  |

By measuring the quantum phase difference, this device can detect charged particles with extremely low kinetic energy, providing a new method for detecting slow-moving particles. It can also be utilized to detect millicharged dark matter particles thermalized with the Earth's environment within the mass range of $10^3\sim 10^{10}\,$GeV.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Pressure induced electronic band evolution and observation of superconductivity in the Dirac semimetal ZrTe5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08547v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a comprehensive investigation of the pressure effects on the magnetotransport properties of the topological material ZrTe5 within 1 to 8 GPa pressure range. With increasing pressure, the characteristic peak (Tp) in its electrical resistivity first shifts to higher temperature and then moves quickly towards the lower temperature before disappearing eventually at 6 GPa. Beyond 6 GPa, the system exhibits metallic behavior across the entire temperature range, and superconductivity emerges below Tc = 1.8 K at 8 GPa. Based on the systematic magnetotransport measurement under pressure, we demonstrate that the superconductivity occurs following a significant electronic structure modulation possibly due to pressure induced structural changes near 6 GPa, which coincides with dramatic enhancement of the magnetoresistance (MR) reaching up to 1400 percent. Our experimental results are substantiated by density functional theory calculations as the application of pressure drastically alters the density of states near the Fermi level. Notably, multiple hole pockets emerge at the Fermi level from 4 GPa onward, and their contributions are further enhanced with increasing pressure. The combined experimental and theoretical investigation reveals a comprehensive evolution of electronic structure of Dirac semimetal ZrTe5 under pressure and suggest a possible link between the Fermi surface reconstruction in the pressure range of structural transition and emergence of superconductivity</p></details> | 14 Pages, 16 Figures |
| **[Intimate relationship between spin configuration in the triplet pair and superconductivity in UTe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08358v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin-triplet superconductivity is an intriguing quantum coherent state with both spin and orbital degrees of freedom, which holds significant potential for future applications in quantum technology. However, how the spin of the triplet pairs responds to an external magnetic field remains poorly understood. This is mainly due to the absence of suitable spin-triplet superconductors. Here, we report results of Knight-shift and ac-susceptibility measurements on UTe$_2$. We demonstrate that the spin susceptibility, which slightly decreases compared to the normal-state value below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, is rapidly restored and nearly recovers to the normal-state values around 5 T, well below the SC upper critical field $H_{c2}$ when the magnetic field is applied along the $c$ axis ($H \parallel c$). In addition, we found that $H_{\rm c2}$ of superconductivity becomes larger when the SC spin aligns with the magnetic field. By considering the results on $H \parallel b$, our results suggest the presence of a close relationship between the spin configuration of the triplet pair and $H_{\rm c2}$, as well as the anisotropic pinning interaction acting on the triplet pairs. These phenomena, which have never been observed in spin-singlet superconductors, represent characteristic features unique to spin-triplet superconductors. We discuss the similarities between superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and superfluid $^3$He, focusing on their spin-triplet pairing states.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, to be published in Phys.

| **[Fermi-liquid transport beyond the upper critical field in superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19011v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unconventional superconductivity typically emerges out of a strongly correlated normal state, manifesting as a highly renormalized Fermi liquid or a strange metal with $T$-linear resistivity. In Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates, superconductivity with a critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ exceeding 80 and 40~K has been respectively realised in pressurized bulk crystals and epitaxially strained thin films. These advancements call for the characterisation of fundamental normal-state and superconducting parameters in these new materials platforms of high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity. Here we report detailed magnetotransport experiments on superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ (LPNO) thin films under pulsed magnetic fields up to 64~T and access the normal-state behaviour over a wide temperature range between 1.5 and 300~K. We find that the normal state of thin-film LPNO exhibits the hallmarks of Fermi-liquid transport, including $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall angle, and $H^2$ magnetoresistance obeying Kohler scaling. Using the empirical Kadowaki-Woods ratio, we estimate a quasiparticle effective mass $m^*/m_e \simeq 10$, thereby revealing the highly renormalized Fermi liquid state therein. Our results demonstrate that thin-film LPNO follows the same $T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm F}$ scaling observed across a myriad of strongly correlated superconductors and establish key normal-state characteristics of strained bilayer superconducting nickelates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-Loop Phase-Coherence Compensation for Superconducting Qubits Integrated Computational and Hardware Validation of the Aurora Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20741v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an emulator-based and hardware feasibility study of Aurora-DD, a phase-coherence compensation method that integrates a sign-based feedback update of a global phase offset (Delta phi) with a fixed-depth XY8 dynamical decoupling (DD) scaffold. The feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware. This represents an "offline closed-loop, online open-loop" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value <Z>, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution. Overall, the combined results support pre-calibrated Aurora-DD as a practical, stable, and hardware-compatible phase-coherence compensator for NISQ devices in single-qubit settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures Version 2.

| **[Spin responses of a disordered helical superconducting edge under Zeeman field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04263v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Coexistence of Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations and Superconductivity in La2SmNi2O7 Thin Films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07994v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity is fundamental for understanding unconventional high-temperature superconductors. In the recently discovered Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates-which achieve superconducting transition temperatures up to ~100 K-this connection has been theoretically predicted but experimentally unverified. Using compressively strained La2SmNi2O7 thin films, we report direct evidence for this interplay. We observe a characteristic 'Mexican hat'-shaped magnetoresistance, a signature of superconductivity coexisting with emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations. This distinctive feature arises from a competition between the magnetic field's suppression of AFM fluctuation-driven scattering and its suppression of superconducting fluctuations. We quantify these AFM fluctuations by a crossover field, B*, whose magnitude decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes near the superconducting onset-behavior contrasting sharply with that in high-Tc cuprates. Our results establish not merely coexistence, but also a direct and novel correlation between AFM instability and superconductivity in nickelates, offering crucial insight into their pairing mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mutual Inductance Sensing SQUID: Cryogenic microcalorimeter based on mutual inductance readout of superconducting temperature sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07917v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting microcalorimeters, such as superconducting transition-edge sensors and magnetic microcalorimeters, have emerged as state-of-the-art detectors for x-ray emission spectroscopy by combining near-unity quantum efficiency with excellent energy resolution. Despite these achievements, their resolving power has not yet reached the level required to rival modern wavelength-dispersive grating or crystal spectrometers. Here, we introduce a next-generation SQUID-based microcalorimeter concept that exploits the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of a superconductor operated close to its critical temperature. The resulting mutual-inductance-based readout enables in situ tunable signal amplification, while inherently avoiding hysteretic effects that commonly limit superconducting sensors. Experiments with prototype devices demonstrate robust and reproducible operation over a wide temperature range. Based on our measurements and modeling, we project that an energy resolution below 100meV should be achievable with an optimized absorber-sensor combination. This approach therefore represents a promising pathway towards next-generation cryogenic detectors for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Applied Physics Letters</p></details> |
| **[Effect of metal encapsulation on bulk superconducting properties of niobium thin films used in qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07617v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Niobium metal occupies nearly 100\% of the volume of a typical 2D transmon device. While the aluminum Josephson junction is of utmost importance, maintaining quantum coherence across the entire device means that pair-breaking in Nb leads, capacitive pads, and readout resonators can be a major source of decoherence. The established contributors are surface oxides and hydroxides, as well as absorbed hydrogen and oxygen. Metal encapsulation of freshly grown surfaces with non-oxidizing metals, preferably without breaking the vacuum, is a successful strategy to mitigate these issues. While the positive effects of encapsulation are undeniable, it is important to understand its impact on the macroscopic behavior of niobium films. We present a comprehensive study of the bulk superconducting properties of Nb thin films encapsulated with gold and palladium/gold, and compare them to those of bare Nb films. Magneto-optical imaging, magnetization, resistivity, and London and Campbell penetration depth measurements reveal significant differences in encapsulated samples. Both sputtered, and epitaxial Au-capped films exhibit the highest residual resistivity ratio and superconducting transition temperature, as well as the lowest upper critical field, London penetration depth, and critical current. These results are in good agreement with the microscopic theory of anisotropic normal and superconducting states of Nb. We conclude that pair-breaking in the bulk of niobium films, driven by disorder throughout the film rather than just at the surface, is a significant source of quantum decoherence in transmons. We also conclude that gold capping not only passivates the surface but also affects the properties of the entire film, significantly reducing the scattering rate due to defects likely induced by surface diffusion if the film is not protected immediately after fabrication.</p></details> |  |

| **[Resolving Quantum Criticality in the Honeycomb Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03656v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum phase transitions driven by electronic correlations are central to understanding the physics of graphene and related two-dimensional materials. A paradigmatic example is the semimetal-to-Mott-insulator transition on the honeycomb lattice, governed by the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class, yet consensus on its critical exponents has remained elusive for over a decade due to severe finite-size effects and the absence of rigorous conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+20...</summary><p>12+20 pages, 6+16 figures</p></details> |
| **[Super-Tonks-Girardeau Quench in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10910v4)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the effect of a quench from a one-dimensional gas with strong and repulsive local interactions to a strongly attractive one, known as the super-Tonks-Girardeau effect. By incorporating both an optical lattice and non-local interactions (specifically nearest-neighbor), we discover a previously unexplored phenomenon: the disruption of the state during the quench, but within a specific range of interactions. Our study employs the extended Bose-Hubbard model across various system sizes, starting with analytical results for two atoms and progressing to few-body systems using exact diagonalization, DMRG and TDVP methods. Finally, we use a numerical implementation of the local density approximation for a macroscopic number of atoms. Consistently, our findings unveil a region where the initially self-bound structure expands due to the super-Tonks-Girardeau quench. The fast evaporation provides a tool to characterize the phase diagram in state-of-art experiments exploring the physics of the extended Bose-Hubbard model.</p></details> | Comments welcome! |
| **[One-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09311v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures. v2: Final version as accepted by Physical Review B</p></details> |

Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $π$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+4 ...</summary><p>12+4 pages, 12+7 figures, minor changes, accepted version</p></details> |
| **[Dynamical correlations and nonequilibrium sum rules in photodoped Hubbard ladders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13664v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using matrix product state techniques we study the nonequilibrium dynamical response of the half-filled Hubbard ladder when subject to an optical pump. Optical pumping offers a way of producing and manipulating new strongly correlated phenomena by suppressing existing magnetic correlations. The ladder allows the effects of pump directionality to be investigated, and compared to a single chain it has strong spin-charge coupling and a fully gapped excitation spectrum, promising different nonequilibrium physics. We compute time-dependent correlations, including the nonequilibrium dynamical structure factors for spin and charge. By deriving a combined spin-charge sum rule that applies both in and out-of-equilibrium, we show that spectral weight is pumped directly from the antiferromagnetic spin response into a low energy $ω\sim 0$ charge response below the Mott gap. The transfer of weight is pump direction dependent: pumping directed along the legs disrupts magnetic correlations more than pumping in the rung direction, even if the post pump energy density is similar. The charge correlation length is dramatically enhanced by the pump, whilst the spin correlations are most strongly suppressed at nearest and next-nearest neighbour spacings. After the pump the system is in a nonthermal correlated metallic state, with gapless charge excitations and approximately equal spin and charge correlation lengths, emphasising the importance of treating these degrees of freedom on an equal footing in nonequilibrium systems.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Pseudogap, Fermi liquid, Van Hove singularity and maxima of the compressibility and of the Knight shift as a function of doping in the two-dimensional Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06298v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Qualitative changes in thermodynamic and single-particle properties characterize the transition between the pseudogapped electronic liquid and the Fermi liquid. Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $κ(δ)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $δ$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $κ(δ)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $κ(δ)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(π,π)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $ω=0$. The Knight shift, $χ_{sp}(0,0)(δ)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U < U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $δ_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $δ=δ_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community.</p></details> |  |

We study ground-state properties using the exact diagonalization method, where the system is modeled by a three-component Fermi Hubbard Hamiltonian. We find that in addition to the standard phase separation between a strongly repulsive impurity and the bath, a strongly-attractive impurity also phase separates with the fermionic holes. Furthermore, we find that the impurity can show an oscillatory pattern in its density for intermediate bath-impurity interactions, which are induced by Friedel oscillations in the fermionic bath. This rich behavior of the impurity could be probed with fermionic ultracold mixtures in optical lattices.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |

Using exact diagonalization, we characterize the transition from weakly- to strongly-correlated dimer and tetramer states along the one- to two-dimensional crossover in coupled-chain geometries by combining local correlation signatures with global diagnostics such as the binding energy and interspecies entanglement entropy. We show that transverse connectivity between chains qualitatively reshapes the phase diagram, substantially enlarging the tetramer region and, in particular, stabilizing weakly bound tetramers when compared to the one-dimensional chains. By tuning the interchain hopping, we identify a transition from a degenerate manifold of spatially separated dimers to a localized tetramer ground state, driven by the lifting of one-dimensional configurational degeneracies and an associated kinetic-energy gain. Finally, we demonstrate interaction and geometric quench protocols to dynamically prepare these complexes with high fidelity. Our results provide a microscopic framework for engineering and probing few-body bosonic bound states in tunable lattice geometries.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Spin and Charge Conductivity in the Square Lattice Fermi-Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03771v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical properties are notoriously difficult to compute in numerical treatments of the Fermi-Hubbard model, especially in two spatial dimensions. However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region. Our method helps paint a more complete picture of the conductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and opens the door to studying dynamical properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |

Although the spectral properties of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model have been well characterized, the corresponding dynamical signatures across the transition to regularity remain less explored . In this work, we investigate this transition by analyzing the time evolution of the survival probability, the single-site entanglement entropy, and the half-chain imbalance. Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figure |
| **[Analysis of self-thermalization dynamics in the Bose-Hubbard model by using the pseudoclassical approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22553v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the self-thermalization dynamics of the $M$-site Bose-Hubbard model in terms of the single-particle density matrix that is calculated by using the pseudoclassical approach. It is shown that a weak inter-particle interaction, which suffices to convert the integrable system of non-interacting bosons into a chaotic system, has a negligible effect on the thermal density matrix given by the Bose-Einstein distribution. This opens the door for equilibration where the two coupled Bose-Hubbard systems, which are initially in different thermal states, relax to the same thermal state. When we couple these two subsystems by using a lattice of the length $L\ll M$, we numerically calculate the quasi-stationary current of Bose particles across the lattice and show that its magnitude is consistent with the solution of the master equation for the boundary driven $L$-site Bose-Hubbard model.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Emergent Spatial Textures from Interaction Quenches in the Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22053v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction quenches in strongly correlated electron systems provide a powerful route to probe nonequilibrium many-body dynamics. For the Hubbard model, nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory has revealed coherent post-quench oscillations, dynamical crossovers, and long-lived transient regimes. However, these studies are largely restricted to spatially homogeneous dynamics and therefore neglect the role of spatial structure formation during ultrafast evolution. Here we investigate interaction quenches in the half-filled Hubbard model using a real-space time-dependent Gutzwiller framework. We show that homogeneous nonequilibrium dynamics is generically unstable: even arbitrarily weak spatial fluctuations grow dynamically and drive the system toward intrinsically inhomogeneous states. Depending on the interaction strength, the post-quench evolution exhibits spatial differentiation, nucleation, and slow coarsening of Mott-like domains. Our results establish spatial self-organization as a generic feature of far-from-equilibrium correlated matter and reveal a fundamental limitation of spatially homogeneous nonequilibrium theories.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5+4 Figures |

By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity. Notably, we propose a unified framework linking disorder-driven localization to deterministic phase frustration, identifying the Bubble Phase as a pristine, disorder-free archetype of the Bose glass. Our results provide a theoretical blueprint for realizing glassy dynamics in clean quantum simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21056v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems. Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlated dynamics of three-particle bound states induced by emergent impurities in Bose-Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20042v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bound states, known as particles tied together and moving as a whole, are profound correlated effects induced by particle-particle interactions. While dimer-monomer bound states are manifested as a single particle attached to dimer bound pair, it is still unclear about quantum walks and Bloch oscillations of dimer-monomer bound states. Here, we revisit three-particle bound states in the Bose-Hubbard model and find that interaction-induced impurities adjacent to bound pair and boundaries cause two kinds of bound states: one is dimer-monomer bound state and the other is bound edge states. In quantum walks, the spread velocity of dimer-monomer bound state is determined by the maximal group velocity of their energy band, which is much smaller than that in the single-particle case. In Bloch oscillations, the period of dimer-monomer bound states is one third of that in the single-particle case. Our works provide new insights to the collective dynamics of three-particle bound states.</p></details> |  |

Floquet engineering, the coherent dressing of quantum states with periodic non-resonant optical fields, has become an important strategy for quantum control. Most applications to solid-state systems have targeted weakly interacting or single-ion states, leaving the manipulation of many-body wavefunctions largely unexplored. Here, we use Floquet engineering to achieve quantum control of a strongly correlated Hubbard exciton in the one-dimensional Mott insulator Sr$_2$CuO$_3$. A nonresonant midinfrared optical field coherently dresses the exciton wavefunction, driving its rotation between bright and dark states. We use resonant third-harmonic generation to quantify ultrafast $π/2$ rotations on the Bloch sphere spanned by these exciton states.

By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+7 p...</summary><p>7+7 pages, 5+6 figures, 1+0 tables</p></details> |

The exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, in particular, remains in need of definitive study within fundamental electronic models. Here we employ state-of-the-art finite-temperature and ground-state tensor network approaches to systematically explore the superconducting (SC) phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model subjected to Zeeman fields. We find that zero-momentum $d$-wave superconductivity persists until the spin gap closes, coexisting with charge density waves. A novel $d$-wave FFLO phase emerges under a higher Zeeman field even above the Pauli limit, concomitant with a field-enhanced spin density waves. We identify these phases, characterized by the simultaneous presence of pairing condensate and density wave orders, as charge-2e supersolids. Analysis of Matsubara Green's function reveals that the FFLO pairing momentum is locked to the underlying Fermi surface. Our results provide microscopic insights into field-induced unconventional pairing mechanisms and reveal the long-sought FFLO state in a fundamental correlated electron model, offering a promising route for its realization in ultracold atom optical lattice.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages, 4+4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Consistent gauge theories for the slave particle representation of the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09264v3)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to clarify the confusion and inconsistency in our recent works [1,2], and to address the incompleteness therein. In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints is BRST-exact in our theory. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($δ\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $δ= 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $δ= 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition.

We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion.

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Here we report polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering measurements on high-quality single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Below 150\,K, we observe a pronounced, symmetry-dependent redistribution of spectral weight in B$_{1g}$ and B$_{2g}$ channels, consistent with the formation of spin-density-wave (SDW) gaps. Quantitative analysis reveals momentum-selective SDW gap amplitudes, with intermediate-to-strong coupling near X/Y points of the Brillouin zone and weaker coupling along the diagonal direction, indicating an unconventional SDW driven by anisotropic electronic correlations. Our results establish the electronic character of the SDW in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, and provide a microscopic foundation for understanding the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity under pressure in nickelates.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Upon entering the spin density wave state below 153 K, the $A_{1g}$ channel exhibits an abrupt electronic spectral gap with a clear isosbestic point. In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations. Collectively, these findings identify a ground state of the bilayer nickelate characterized by competing bond-diagonal interactions, spin disproportionation, and an incipient lattice instability, establishing key ingredients for understanding the mechanism of nickelate superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Here, we employ micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ($μ$-ARPES) on single-domain Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ to disentangle the complex hierarchy of intrinsic and back-folded bands, explicitly identifying the electronic states driving the DW phase transition. We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $α$ and $β$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\sim44$ meV on the $α$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $β$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping. These results define a coherent microscopic fingerprint for the trilayer nickelates, identifying the specific nesting channels and correlation effects that underpin the phase diagram.</p></details> | 10 pages,5 figures |

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the superconducting state, it is essential to elucidate the nature of the DW order. In this study, we utilized $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) to investigate the charge density wave (CDW) and spin density wave (SDW) orders in both single-crystal and polycrystalline La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Near $T_{\rm{DW}} \approx 133$ K, an abrupt change in both the linewidth and frequency of the La(2) site in the single-crystal sample provides compelling evidence for a first-order-like phase transition. The pronounced broadening of the NQR lines indicates the incommensurate nature of the DW order. Furthermore, the spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature 1/$T_1$$T$ exhibits a strong enhancement at $T_{\rm{DW}}$, indicating the strong spin fluctuations above the first-order DW transition. These observations suggest an intricate interplay between incommensurate CDW and SDW orders. Our findings offer critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms of the DW state in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and establish an essential framework for exploring the interplay between DW and superconducting phases in nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have been found in this phase. At ambient pressure, La3Ni2O7-1313 has been reported to crystallize in three different space-group symmetries Cmmm, Imma, and Fmmm. Unlike the commonly observed tilted NiO6 octahedra in perovskite nickelates, the Cmmm phase exhibits no NiO6 tilts, implying that this structural feature alone may be insufficient to give rise to superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Here, we employ first-principles calculations and group theory analysis to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in this SL-TL La3Ni2O7 polymorph. At ambient pressure, we identify multiple unstable phonon branches in the highest symmetry (Cmmm) structure at various high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Distortions associated with these instabilities lead to one of the other experimentally reported space groups (Imma) that does display octahedral tilts. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7-1313 at ambient pressure is dominated by the TL block, as the SL is in a Mott-insulating regime. Under pressure, a tetragonal P4/mmm structure becomes stable, in agreement with experiments.</p></details> |  |

Establishing the diversity of ground states across different Ruddlesden-Popper phases is crucial for elucidating the superconducting mechanisms in these nickelates. Motivated by the recent report of superconductivity in hybrid 1212-type La5Ni3O11, we synthesized and investigated the long-range-ordered hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7. In contrast to its bilayer counterpart, the 1313-type La3Ni2O7 exhibits characteristic semiconducting behavior at ambient pressure, displaying a distinct anomaly at 170 K. This behavior is consistently evidenced by measurements of both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy unambiguously indicates a spin-density-wave transition occurring at 170 K. High-pressure electrical transport measurements demonstrate the induction of metallization under pressure, yet reveal no discernible traces of superconductivity up to 65 GPa. Our findings establish hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7 as a new member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family exhibiting a distinct spin-density-wave transition, and offers a new platform for investigating the interplay among crystal structure, electronic orders, and superconductivity in hybrid nickelates.</p></details> | 18 papers, 4 figures |

The realization of superconductivity in thin films requires delicate control of growth conditions, which presents significant challenges in the synthesis process. Furthermore, the stability of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$ films is compromised by oxygen loss, which complicates their characterization. We introduce an effective recycling protocol that involves oxygen removal in a precursor phase followed by ozone-assisted annealing, which restores superconducting properties. By tuning the oxygen content, we construct an electronic phase diagram that highlights oxygen addition as a potential analogue to hole doping via La substitution with Sr, providing insights into the doping mechanism and guiding future material optimization.</p></details> |  |

In the ordered phase, the anisotropy grows more than an order of magnitude as the out-of-plane conductivity is sharply suppressed. We interpret this enhancement as an effective electronic decoupling of the Ni-O layers, driven by a spin-density-wave-induced redistribution of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ occupation within the trilayers. This electronic response is accompanied by clear shifts and splittings of the out-of-plane phonons, compatible with a density-wave instability of electronic origin.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 22 figures, main text and supplementary material</p></details> |

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($α,α^{\prime},β$) and two hole pockets ($γ,γ^{\prime}$), where the additional $α^{\prime}$ and $γ^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $γ$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the fate of the superconducting properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

While both nickelates exhibit density-wave (DW) transitions accompanied by the opening of a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck, their electronic responses display strikingly different symmetry properties. La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ maintains an isotropic optical response across the entire temperature range. In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K. The presence of macroscopic electronic anisotropy in the bilayer system, and its absence in the trilayer system, suggests an intimate relation between electronic nematic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ that worth for deeper explorations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% ($\sim$ 2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures.

Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\rm DW} \approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $ΔT_{SDW} \simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p></details> |  |

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\it within} the $γ$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Using fully self-consistent DFT+$U$ calculations on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures, we identify that intrinsic hole doping via interfacial Sr interdiffusion is the decisive factor in stabilizing the metallic state. Our 1-unit-cell model accurately reproduces the ARPES-observed Fermi surface, particularly the critical Ni-$d_{z^2}$ derived $γ$ hole pocket, which originates exclusively from the interface-proximal bilayer. Furthermore, comparative tight-binding analysis suggests that the reduced superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in thin films stems from the synergistic suppression of the electronic density of states (DOS) and vertical superexchange coupling ($J \perp Z$). These findings highlight that interface engineering plays a critical role beyond simple strain imposition in modulating nickelate orbital physics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional Hubbard model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

However, how the spin of the triplet pairs responds to an external magnetic field remains poorly understood. This is mainly due to the absence of suitable spin-triplet superconductors. Here, we report results of Knight-shift and ac-susceptibility measurements on UTe$_2$. We demonstrate that the spin susceptibility, which slightly decreases compared to the normal-state value below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, is rapidly restored and nearly recovers to the normal-state values around 5 T, well below the SC upper critical field $H_{c2}$ when the magnetic field is applied along the $c$ axis ($H \parallel c$). In addition, we found that $H_{\rm c2}$ of superconductivity becomes larger when the SC spin aligns with the magnetic field. By considering the results on $H \parallel b$, our results suggest the presence of a close relationship between the spin configuration of the triplet pair and $H_{\rm c2}$, as well as the anisotropic pinning interaction acting on the triplet pairs. These phenomena, which have never been observed in spin-singlet superconductors, represent characteristic features unique to spin-triplet superconductors. We discuss the similarities between superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and superfluid $^3$He, focusing on their spin-triplet pairing states.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, to be published in Phys.

We report that the heavy-Fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a fluctuation regime that extends over a temperature range as wide as $T_{\rm c}$ itself -- the largest observed for any three-dimensional superconductor. Through ultrasound measurements of the elastic moduli and sound attenuation, we find that UTe$_2$ transitions from a mean-field-like state at ambient pressure to a fluctuation dominated state at higher pressures. This regime is marked by elastic softening and an increase in sound attenuation that onsets well above $T_{\rm c}$, with the attenuation remaining anomalously high deep in the superconducting state. Our analysis shows that these features stem from an extremely low superfluid phase stiffness. This results in a kinetic inductance as high as that of granular aluminum, but achieved in the clean limit. We propose that this exotic state is driven by dominant inter-band pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, leading to "local" cooper pairs with a coherence length of only a few lattice constants.</p></details> | 7 figures |

Motivated by these experiments, we theoretically investigate the topological surface states on the (011) surface of UTe$_2$. We find that a two-dimensional nearly flat band emerges in the $B_{3u}$ state, giving rise to a pronounced zero-energy peak in the surface density of states. This flat band is supported by two key mechanisms: (i)~nontrivial Berry phases defined at multiple momenta give rise to low-energy in-gap states, and (ii)~weak spin conservation allows the gap function to acquire phase winding. Furthermore, to investigate the relation between the zero-bias peak observed in recent STM experiments with a superconducting tip and the topological surface states, we calculate the nonequilibrium dc tunneling current in a junction between an $s$-wave superconductor and the (011) surface of UTe$_2$. Our results provide crucial insights into the superconducting pairing symmetry realized in UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages |

At low temperatures, the specific heat exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field when the field is applied precisely along the $b$ axis, in stark contrast to its rapid increase at low fields for other orientations. This pronounced anisotropy suggests the presence of nodal quasiparticle excitations with the Fermi velocity predominantly aligned along the $b$ axis. Considering the characteristic field-angle dependences of both the specific heat and the upper critical field, these observations are broadly compatible with theoretical models that assume a superconducting gap structure featuring either point nodes consistent with $B_{\rm 2u}$ symmetry, allowed in the infinitely strong spin-orbit coupling scheme, or line nodes confined to flat regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, consistent with $^3B_{\rm 3u}$ symmetry in the finite spin-orbit classification scheme. These results yield crucial hints for resolving the pairing symmetry of UTe$_2$, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its spin-triplet superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in J.

Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2.

The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle Δ_{z}\rangle/\langleΔ_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>21+14...</summary><p>21+14 pages, 5+9 figures, 1+1 tables</p></details> |

Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity are observed in the longitudinal elastic mode $c_{11}$ for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$ from $b$-axis. We confirm an upper critical field of $H_{\rm c2}\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and bulk superconductivity which survives up to $T\approx 2$ K for fields above the metamagnetic transition. The $c_{11}$ mode has propagation and displacement vectors along the $a$-axis, and for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$, this mode is sensitive to the elasticity of the vortex lattice. The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material included</p></details> |

Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures (including SI)</p></details> |

We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $μ_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted as regular article</p></details> |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

We show that the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit $H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to $\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry. It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.</p></details> | 41pages, 14figures |
| **[Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15322v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $χ^b > χ^a > χ^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $χ^a > χ^c > χ^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |

In ultra-clean single crystals, we identify a field-induced phase transition within the superconducting state at 5.6 T, driven by metamagnetism. This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.</p></details> |  |

At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($κ$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$κ$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $κ$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</p></details> | 21 pages. 17 figures |

Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Collinear $p$-wave magnetism and hidden orbital ferrimagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07418v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, collinear magnets are classified as even-wave magnets, i.e., either ferro-, antiferro-, or altermagnets. It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets. Our work provides a new perspective on collinear magnets and the spin-space group classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[${\bf \frac{h}{e}}$ flux quantization in metals due to Berry phase coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12223v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Berry curvature does not show itself in the relative phase correlation of wave-functions at different spatial points in a metal unless the fermions have closed trajectories in momentum space, for example those around isolated impurities. But these, just as the Bloch phase correlations, disappear at lengths larger than the diffusion length. If a quasi-two dimensional metal with Berry curvature has a set of domains, their boundaries necessarily carry chiral currents precluding back-ward scattering. The Berry induced phase coherence then persists over length scales of order the scale at which the chiral one-dimensional states scatter into the bulk states, which can be macroscopic. The conditions for their occurrence and the lengths and the orientation of such states are derived. These calculations are used to understand the remarkable aspects of a recent experiment in an anisotropic metal, reported to have loop-current order, with mean-free path of about 0.01 $μ$m which exhibits flux quantization in some transport properties over lengths of several $μ$m. %It is also shown that generating the appropriately oriented channels in the plane by the field applied is plausible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982v4)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum XY model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two-dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moiré twisted bi-layer graphene and bilayer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear-in-temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those caused by Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature-independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln ω_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p></details> | 65 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Artificial electrostatic crystals: a new platform for creating correlated quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12769v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electronic properties of solids are determined by the crystal structure and interactions between electrons, giving rise to a variety of collective phenomena including superconductivity, strange metals and correlated insulators. The mechanisms underpinning many of these collective phenomena remain unknown, driving interest in creating artificial crystals which replicate the system of interest while allowing precise control of key parameters. Here we demonstrate the formation of highly tunable artificial crystals by superimposing a periodic electrostatic potential on the 2D electron gas in an ultra-shallow (25 nm deep) GaAs quantum well. The 100 nm period artificial crystal is identified by the formation of a new bandstructure, different from the original cubic crystal and specific to the artificial triangular lattice: transport measurements show the Hall coefficient changing sign as the chemical potential sweeps through the artificial bands. Uniquely, the artificial bandstructure can be continuously tuned to form linear graphene-like and flat kagome-like bands in a single device. A strong insulating state is observed at half filling of the kagome flat band, which is not expected in the absence of strong interactions. This state, unique to the kagome lattice, is consistent with a loop-current Wigner insulator, which arises from long-range Coulomb interaction and delocalised electrons between neighbouring empty sites. The ability to continuously tune the bandstructure and access flat bands through electrical gating within a single device opens a new route to studying collective quantum states.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Suppl.: 16 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $θ$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $π$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital Altermagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00509v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of \emph{orbital altermagnetism}, a symmetry-protected magnetic order of pure orbital degrees of freedom. It is characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking. First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$, so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand, it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO. The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.</p></details> | 16 Page, 9 Figures |
| **[Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagomé metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting state in a kagomé lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry.

| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |

Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |

When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagomé lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagomé metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagomé lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09316v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity in a Chern band: effect of time-reversal-symmetry breaking on superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16508v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-reversal-symmetry breaking is generally understood to be detrimental for superconductivity. However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $κ_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

By strengthening proofs relating to small-angle initialisation, we provide a full circuit model which does not suffer from barren plateaus and is robust against current classical simulation techniques, specifically tensor network contraction and Pauli propagation. We propose this as a quantum generative model amenable towards NISQ devices and quantum-classical hybrid models, raising new questions in the debate regarding usefulness of VQCs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a pre-trained tensor-train (TT) encoding network (Pre-TT-Encoder) that significantly reduces the computational complexity of amplitude encoding while preserving essential data structure. The Pre-TT-Encoder exploits low-rank TT decompositions learned from classical data, enabling polynomial-time state preparation in the number of qubits and TT-ranks. We provide a theoretical analysis of the encoding complexity and establish fidelity bounds that quantify the trade-off between TT-rank and approximation error. Empirical evaluations on classical (MNIST) and quantum-native (semiconductor quantum dot) datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial gains in encoding efficiency over direct amplitude encoding and PCA-based dimensionality reduction, while maintaining competitive performance in downstream variational quantum circuit classification tasks. The proposed method highlights the role of tensor networks as scalable intermediaries between classical data and quantum processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

This leads to succinct representations of quantum many-body systems with a tree-like entanglement structure. In this work, we study the task of testing whether an unknown pure state is a TTNS on $n$ qudits with bond dimension at most $r$, or is far in trace distance from any such state. We first establish that, independent of the dimension of the state, $O(nr^2)$ copies suffice to accomplish this task with one-sided error. We then prove that $Ω(n r^2/\log n)$ copies are necessary for any test with one-sided error whenever $r\geq 2 + \log n$. In particular, this closes a roughly quadratic gap in the previous bounds for testing matrix product states in this setting. On the other hand, when $r=2$ we show that $Θ(\sqrt{n})$ copies are both necessary and sufficient for the related task of testing whether a state is a product of $n$ bipartite states having Schmidt-rank at most $r$, for some choice of the qudit dimensions. We also study the performance of tests using measurements performed on a small number of copies at a time. Here, we obtain new bounds for testing rank, Schmidt-rank, and TTNS when the tester is restricted to making measurements on $r+1$ copies of the state.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 4 figures; v2: typos fixed, Fig. 4 added, minor errors in Sec. 6 corrected</p></details> |

Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image compression and processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</p></details> | paper under review |

The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures. v2: Final version as accepted by Physical Review B</p></details> |
| **[Statistics-encoded tensor network approach in disordered quantum many-body spin chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16286v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems with disorder is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose a general approach -- the statistics-encoded tensor network (SeTN) -- to study such systems. By encoding disorder into an auxiliary layer and averaging separately, SeTN restores translational invariance, enabling a well-defined transfer matrix formulation. We derive a universal criterion, $n \gg α^2 t^2$, linking discretization $n$, disorder strength $α$, and evolution duration $t$. This sets the resolution required for faithful disorder averaging and shows that encoding is most efficient in the weak-disorder, typically chaotic regime. Applied to the disordered transverse-field Ising model, SeTN shows that the spectral form factor is governed by the leading transfer-matrix eigenvalue, in contrast to the kicked Ising model. SeTN thus provides a novel framework for probing the disorder-driven dynamical phenomena in many-body quantum systems.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we study the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement, and more generally entropy estimation for low energy states and Gibbs states. We find, in particular, that the classes qq-QAM [Kobayashi, le Gall, Nishimura, SICOMP 2019] (a quantum analogue of public-coin AM) and QMA(2) (QMA with unentangled proofs) play a crucial role for such problems, showing: (1) Detecting a high-entanglement ground state is qq-QAM-complete, (2) computing an additive error approximation to the Helmholtz free energy (equivalently, a multiplicative error approximation to the partition function) is in qq-QAM, (3) detecting a low-entanglement ground state is QMA(2)-hard, and (4) detecting low energy states which are close to product states can range from QMA-complete to QMA(2)-complete. Our results make progress on an open question of [Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset and Wocjan, Nature Physics 2022] on free energy, and yield the first QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem using local Hamiltonians (cf. the sparse QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012]).</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 1 figure; fixed a small bug and some typos</p></details> |
| **[Tensor network dynamical message passing for epidemic models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06497v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While epidemiological modeling is pivotal for informing public health strategies, a fundamental trade-off limits its predictive fidelity: exact stochastic simulations are often computationally intractable for large-scale systems, whereas efficient analytical approximations typically fail to account for essential short-range correlations and network loops. Here, we resolve this trade-off by introducing Tensor Network Dynamical Message Passing (TNDMP), a framework grounded in a rigorous property we term \textit{Susceptible-Induced Factorization}. This theoretical insight reveals that a susceptible node acts as a dynamical decoupler, factorizing the global evolution operator into localized components. Leveraging this, TNDMP provides a dual-mode algorithmic suite: an exact algorithm that computes local observables with minimal redundancy on tractable topologies and a scalable and tunable approximation for complex real-world networks. We demonstrate that widely adopted heuristics, such as Dynamical Message Passing (DMP) and Pair Approximation (PA), are mathematically recoverable as low-order limits of our framework. Numerical validation in synthetic and real-world networks confirms that TNDMP significantly outperforms existing methods to predict epidemic thresholds and steady states, offering a rigorous bridge between the efficiency of message passing and the accuracy of tensor network formalisms.</p></details> |  |

We first shift and scale an Ising Hamiltonian of the cost function so that all eigenvalues become non-negative and the ground states correspond to the the largest eigenvalues, which are then amplified by power iteration. We represent the transformed Hamiltonian as a matrix product operator (MPO) and form an immense power of this object via truncated MPO-MPO contractions, embedding the resulting operator into a matrix product state for sampling in the computational basis. In contrast to the density-matrix renormalization group, our approach provides a straightforward route to systematic improvement by increasing the bond dimension and is better at avoiding local minima. We also study the performance of this power method in the context of a higher-order Ising Hamiltonian on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, making a comparison with simulated annealing. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms for solving optimization problems and provide a baseline for assessing and developing quantum algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Error Mitigation at the pre-processing stage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05916v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers remains a challenging endeavor, forcing state-of-the-art quantum hardware to rely heavily on noise mitigation techniques. Standard quantum error mitigation is typically based on post-processing strategies. In contrast, the present work explores a pre-processing approach, in which the effects of noise are mitigated before performing a measurement on the output state. The main idea is to find an observable $Y$ such that its expectation value on a noisy quantum state $\mathcal{E(ρ)}$ matches the expectation value of a target observable $X$ on the noiseless quantum state $ρ$. Our method requires the execution of a noisy quantum circuit, followed by the measurement of the surrogate observable $Y$. The main enablers of our method in practical scenarios are Tensor Networks. The proposed method improves over Tensor Error Mitigation (TEM) in terms of average error, circuit depth, and complexity, attaining a measurement overhead that approaches the theoretical lower bound. The improvement in terms of classical computation complexity is in the order of $\sim 10^6$ times when compared to the post-processing computational cost of TEM in practical scenarios. Such gain comes from eliminating the need to perform the set of informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements (IC-POVM) required by TEM, as well as any other tomographic strategy.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Reducing the Computational Cost Scaling of Tensor Network Algorithms via Field-Programmable Gate Array Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05900v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the computational efficiency of quantum many-body calculations from a hardware perspective remains a critical challenge. Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical eigenvalue solver that constructs a wavefunction ansatz from a linear combination of matrix product states in rotated orbital bases, enabling the characterization of strongly correlated ground states with arbitrary spatial geometry. The energy is converged via a gradient-free generalized sweep algorithm based on quantum subspace diagonalization, with a potentially exponential speedup in the off-diagonal matrix element contractions upon translation into compact quantum circuits of linear depth in the number of qubits. Chemical accuracy is attained in numerical experiments for both a stretched water molecule and an octahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms, achieving substantially better correlation energies compared to a unitary coupled-cluster benchmark, with orders of magnitude reductions in quantum resource estimates and a surprisingly high tolerance to shot noise. This proof-of-concept study suggests a promising new avenue for scaling up simulations of strongly correlated chemical systems on near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> | 29 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Branch-and-Bound Tensor Networks for Exact Ground-State Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05470v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing the ground-state properties of disordered systems, such as spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems, is fundamental to science and engineering. However, computing exact ground states and counting their degeneracies are generally NP-hard and #P-hard problems, respectively, posing a formidable challenge for exact algorithms. Recently, Tensor Networks methods, which utilize high-dimensional linear algebra and achieve massive hardware parallelization, have emerged as a rapidly developing paradigm for efficiently solving these tasks. Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the exponential growth of space complexity, which severely limits their scalability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Branch-and-Bound Tensor Network (BBTN) method, which seamlessly integrates the adaptive search framework of branch-and-bound with the efficient contraction of tropical tensor networks, significantly extending the reach of exact algorithms. We show that BBTN significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art solvers, setting new benchmarks for exact computation. It pushes the boundaries of tractability to previously unreachable scales, enabling exact ground-state counting for $\pm J$ spin glasses up to $64 \times 64$ and solving Maximum Independent Set problems on King's subgraphs up to $100 \times 100$. For hard instances, BBTN dramatically reduces the computational cost of standard Tropical Tensor Networks, compressing years of runtime into minutes. Furthermore, it outperforms leading integer-programming solvers by over 30$\times$, establishing a versatile and scalable framework for solving hard problems in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11022v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Efficient time-evolution of matrix product states using average Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04955v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating quantum many-body systems (QMBS) is one of the long-standing, highly non-trivial challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information due to the exponentially growing size of the system's Hilbert space. To date, tensor networks have been an essential tool for studying such quantum systems, owing to their ability to efficiently capture the entanglement properties of the systems they represent. One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS. Here, we propose a simple, yet efficient, method to augment the already available MPS algorithms to simulate the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians with better accuracy and a faster convergence rate, giving a second-order convergence compared to the first-order convergence of the standard method. We apply our proposed method to simulate the dynamics of a chain of single spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which has potential applications for practical and scalable quantum technologies, and find that our method improves the average error for a system of few NV centers by a factor of about 1000 for moderate step sizes. Our work paves the way for efficient simulation of QMBS under the influence of time-dependent Hamiltonians.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Reweighted Time-Evolving Block Decimation for Improved Quantum Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08730v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating an MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_i^\dagger c_j \rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_{i_1}^\dagger c^\dagger_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_n} \rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $γ^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $γ$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competitive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.</p></details> | 22 pages, 15 figures |

To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $λ$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arbitrary control of the temporal waveform of photons during spontaneous emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23462v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control of the temporal waveform of photons produced during spontaneous emission from single quantum emitters provides a crucial tool in the establishment of hybrid quantum systems, optimization of quantum state transfer protocols and mitigation of effects due interferometric instability for network architectures based on flying qubits. We describe a method to generate photons of any temporal waveform from emitters of any excited state lifetime, limited only by the timing resolution of control hardware. We show how the temporal waveform of photons can be controlled by deterministically varying the population of an excited state which undergoes spontaneous emission. Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate quantum emitter: modulation of the (1) amplitude and (2) relative phase of a field coupling a ground state to the excited manifold. We detail how to identify optimal excitation pulses by employing variational algorithms to feed back on atomic populations. Additionally, we develop Quantum Monte Carlo based tools to determine photon-number statistics and establish techniques to identify optimal excitation strengths and post-selection thresholds for photon generation protocols. We situate our work in the context of other prior research on bespoke single photon sources and networking including post-emission pulse shaping, temporal gating and cavity-based methods. In comparison, our free-space process has greater flexibility in producing any waveform, requires less infrastructure, and can be readily applied across a wide range of quantum emitters. We discuss the applications and limits of this technique, including how increasing photon emission probabilities affects achievable temporal-mode overlap fidelities between emitted and target photon waveforms.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

A paradigmatic example is the semimetal-to-Mott-insulator transition on the honeycomb lattice, governed by the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class, yet consensus on its critical exponents has remained elusive for over a decade due to severe finite-size effects and the absence of rigorous conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+20...</summary><p>12+20 pages, 6+16 figures</p></details> |

A domain of particular relevance are correlated inhomogeneous systems. What has been missing so far is a general, scalable deep-learning approach that would enable the rapid prediction of spatial densities for strongly correlated systems in arbitrary potentials. In this work, we present a straightforward scheme, where we learn to predict densities using convolutional neural networks trained on random potentials. While we demonstrate this approach in 1D and 2D lattice models using data from numerical techniques like Quantum Monte Carlo, it is directly applicable as well to training data obtained from experimental quantum simulators. We train networks that can predict the densities of multiple observables simultaneously and that can predict for a whole class of many-body lattice models, for arbitrary system sizes. We show that our approach can handle well the interplay of interference and interactions and the behaviour of models with phase transitions in inhomogeneous situations, and we also illustrate the ability to solve inverse problems, finding a potential for a desired density.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

The package is expandable to arbitrary lattice geometries and custom observables diagonal in either the $X$- or $Z$-basis. ParaToric also supports snapshot extraction in both bases, making it ideal for generating training/benchmarking data for other methods, such as lattice gauge theories, cold atom or other quantum simulators, quantum spin liquids, artificial intelligence, and quantum error correction. The software provides bindings to C/C++ and Python, and is thus almost universally integrable into other software projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 4 figures.

While the use of this space effectively doubles the qubit budget, equaling the number of spatial orbitals, this sector restriction can compromise quantitative accuracy. To compensate for this, we expand sampled bitstrings via their Cartesian product into a larger space that includes seniority-breaking determinants. The resulting wave function is also proposed using the trial state in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) to recover dynamical correlations across the full orbital space (DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC). We evaluate the proposed methods on the H6 chain, N2 dissociation, and the addition of singlet O2 to a BODIPY dye. For the H6 chain, DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC reproduces the accuracy of the level of the complete-active-space counterpart with the quantum device ibm kobe. For N2 and BODIPY-O2, with (14e, 28o) and up to (20e, 20o) active spaces, it yields reasonable results, whereas single-reference CCSD(T) fails qualitatively. These results demonstrate that the DOCI-QSCI doubles the orbital space accessible to conventional QSCI and subsequent ph-AFQMC post-processing delivers reasonably high accuracy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(β_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 12 figures, theoretical study on condensed matter physics (honeycomb lattice Holstein model); no generative AI tools used in research</p></details> |
| **[Impurity Self-Trapping in Lattice Bose systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11058v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We map out the global phase diagram of a single mobile impurity in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, spanning the bath evolution from a compressible superfluid (SF) to an incompressible Mott insulator (MI) and the full range of impurity-bath coupling. Using sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo, we identify two distinct self-trapping mechanisms that organize the entire diagram. In the compressible SF, increasing impurity-bath coupling $|U_{\mathrm{ib}}|$ drives an interaction-driven self-trapping crossover signaled by a collapse of the \emph{impurity} winding number: a light, extended polaron evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately into a self-trapped state -- a repulsive \emph{saturated bubble} or an attractive \emph{bound cluster} -- even while the bath remains globally superfluid, demonstrating self-trapping without any bath phase transition. By contrast, at fixed $U_{\mathrm{ib}}$ and upon tuning the bath across the SF-MI transition, self-trapping becomes compressibility controlled: the vanishing bath compressibility quenches polaronic dressing and collapses the impurity-centered density response, yielding a nearly free defect near criticality and, deep in the MI, a self-trapped vacancy- or particle-type defect bound to the impurity. In the incompressible regime, this proceeds via \emph{quantized defect formation}, manifested by discrete changes in the total bath occupation. Together, our results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity self-trapping in correlated lattice bosons, governed by winding collapse in the SF and by compressibility loss and defect quantization across the SF-MI boundary.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mobile impurity coupled to correlated lattice bosons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11062v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate how the coherence and spatial dressing of a single impurity evolve in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model when the impurity couples attractively to the bath. Using large-scale, sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo, we measure the impurity winding, bath superfluid response and compressibility, and impurity-bath density correlations. In a compressible superfluid bath ($U_{\mathrm{b}}/t=13.3$), strengthening attraction drives an interaction-controlled \emph{winding-collapse self-trapping crossover}: a mobile light polaron evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately into a bound cluster with vanishing winding, while the bath remains globally superfluid. In incompressible Mott-insulating baths, by contrast, extended density rearrangements are suppressed and the dressing cloud collapses; we compare the resulting short-range deformation patterns for both attractive and repulsive couplings. Across the SF-MI transition at fixed moderate attraction ($U_{\mathrm{ib}}/t=-8.0$), the impurity crosses over from a mobile polaron with an extended deformation cloud to a nearly free defect with minimal dressing in the Mott background; for this coupling it does not lock into a fully self-trapped defect even deep in the insulator. Together with our companion Letter [Impurity Self-Trapping in Lattice Bose systems] on repulsive couplings, these results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity self-trapping in correlated lattice bosons, connecting interaction-driven winding collapse in the superfluid to compressibility-controlled undressing across the SF-MI transition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fermionic Approach to Elementary Excitations and Magnetization Plateaus in an S=1/2 XX Hybrid Trimer-Dimer Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06387v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the elementary excitations and magnetization of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XX chain comprising trimer-dimer units (the J1-J1-J2-J3-J2 topology) under a transverse magnetic field h. Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer).</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We benchmark the method for bulk and layered SrVO$_3$ in equilibrium and apply it to a prototypical nonequilibrium geometry in which a voltage bias is applied perpendicular to the layer via reservoirs held at different chemical potentials. For bulk SrVO$_3$, MCA reproduces the metallic state at moderate interaction strengths, but it overestimates the weight of the lower band relative to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and fork tensor product state (FTPS) solvers. With respect to QMC and FTPS, MCA yields an earlier metal-to-insulator transition as the electron-electron interaction is increased. In layered SrVO$_3$ at equilibrium, MCA partially captures the orbital polarization in favor of the in-plane $xy$ orbital, although not as strong as in the DMFT-converged results obtained with QMC. However, when performing a one-shot impurity calculation initialized with the DFMT-QMC results, MCA yields orbital occupations which show a stronger charge polarization in favor of orbital $xy$. This suggests that our approach can be used to study multiorbital impurity problems when the focus is to assess properties without performing the full DMFT self-consistent loop. Finally, under applied bias, we observe a pronounced redistribution of orbital occupations, demonstrating that the method captures bias-driven orbital charge transfer in realistic materials in nonequilibrium conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[On the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11022v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

The package implements efficient low-rank updates that reduce the cost of successive wavefunction evaluations from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$ when the update rank $k$ is smaller than the dimension $n$ of matrices. Both determinant and Pfaffian updates are supported, together with delayed-update strategies that trade floating-point operations for reduced memory traffic on modern accelerators. lrux natively integrates with JAX transformations such as JIT compilation, vectorization, and automatic differentiation, and supports both real and complex data types. Benchmarks on GPUs demonstrate up to $1000\times$ speedup at large matrix sizes. lrux enables scalable, high-performance evaluation of antisymmetric wavefunctions and is designed as a drop-in component for a wide range of QMC workflows. lrux is available at https://github.com/ChenAo-Phys/lrux.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting underlying symmetry-protected topological phases via strange correlators and edge engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04973v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast majority of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states are difficult to detect, which often leads to their misidentification as ordinary or topologically trivial phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for detecting these hidden topological states. We distinguish the ordinary matter state from the topological phase by exploiting the boundary effects in space (via surface behaviors on engineered edge) and time (via strange correlators) according to the principle of bulk-edge correspondence. As a concrete example, we study the dimerized spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on its paramagnetic dimer phase and edge states. The dimer phase has been widely regarded as topologically trivial due to its gapped edge state on conventional edges. However, the model can also be viewed as two-dimensional antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled usual ladders, which suggests an SPT state adiabatically connected to the one-dimensional Haldane phase. We resolve this puzzle and demonstrate that the dimer phase is indeed a quasi-one-dimensional SPT state by measuring generalized strange correlators introduced in this work and by showing that the nontrivial gapless edge state on a zigzag edge is ferromagnetically ordered, resulting from effective ferromagnetic interactions between degenerate spinons liberated on each side of the cut. Furthermore, we show that the ordered edge state gives rise to an extraordinary surface critical behavior at the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) bulk critical points of the model, which contradicts theoretical predictions based on classical-quantum mapping. Overall, we establish a standard detection method for uncovering topological phases that masquerade as ordinary states of matter.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

Here we combine DFT+$U$, finite-temperature DMFT with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations to investigate Li$^+$ migration for a single Li vacancy in paramagnetic Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $μ^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders. Our results highlight the importance of finite-temperature dynamical correlations for Li-ion migration in correlated oxides and provide a framework for incorporating strong Coulomb interactions in future studies of transition-metal oxide battery materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Tensor networks are an invaluable tool for efficiently representing states of large quantum systems with limited entanglement. Algorithms for sampling one-dimensional (1D) tensor networks are well-established and utilized in several 1D tensor network methods. In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of algorithms for 1D tensor networks. The first algorithm we propose performs independent sampling and yields a single configuration together with its associated probability. The second algorithm employs a greedy search strategy to identify K high-probability configurations and their corresponding probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms across quantum states with varying entanglement and system size.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05222v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr{ö}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or extensive datasets, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as Density Functional Theory. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires 6$N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces. This paper presents a way to replace the 6$N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the unbiased VMC forces with those obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones. Our benchmark test also reveals that the unbiased VMC forces yield very consistent values with hybrid and meta GGAs, but do not necessarily yield values that are very close to those of CCSD(T).</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) has been successfully applied to analyze experimental X-ray scattering measurements, but its high computational cost renders routine application impractical. Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT. We further show that even at temperatures on the order of 100 eV, quantum non-locality remains essential for correctly describing the electronic structure of dense hydrogen.</p></details> |  |

With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published version with minor changes</p></details> |

| **[Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unconventional superconducting phases are distinguished by broken symmetries in their order parameters. Here, we report the discovery of an exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene at high displacement fields, marked by its coexistence with both a stripe charge order and the anomalous Hall effect. In angle-resolved transport measurements, the onset of stripe order is manifested as thermally activated insulating behavior along one axis, with highly conductive transport along the orthogonal direction. Upon cooling, superconductivity emerges exclusively along the high-conductivity axis, forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels. This anisotropic superconducting phase exhibits multiple first-order hysteretic transitions. Pronounced thermal hysteresis-between warming and cooling across the superconducting transition-suggests a melting transition of the underlying stripe phase. Additionally, magnetic-field-induced switching-similar to phenomena reported in tetra- and pentalayer graphene-supports the chiral nature of the superconducting state. Together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripy Hall crystal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with method section and SI, 5 figures in main text</p></details> |
| **[Logical multi-qubit entanglement with dual-rail superconducting qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12099v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in quantum error correction (QEC) across hardware platforms have demonstrated operation near and beyond the fault-tolerance threshold, yet achieving exponential suppression of logical errors through code scaling remains a critical challenge. Erasure qubits, which enable hardware-level detection of dominant error types, offer a promising path toward resource-efficient QEC by exploiting error bias. Single erasure qubits with dual-rail encoding in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high coherence and low single-qubit gate errors with mid-circuit erasure detection, but the generation of multi-qubit entanglement--a fundamental requirement for quantum computation and error correction--has remained an outstanding milestone. Here, we demonstrate a superconducting processor integrating four dual-rail erasure qubits that achieves the logical multi-qubit entanglement with error-biased protection. Each dual-rail qubit, encoded in pairs of tunable transmons, preserves millisecond-scale coherence times and single-qubit gate errors at the level of $10^{-5}$. By engineering tunable couplings between logical qubits, we generate high-fidelity entangled states resilient to physical qubit noise, including logical Bell states (98.8% fidelity) and a three-logical-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state (93.5% fidelity). A universal gate set is realized through a calibrated logical controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate with 96.2% process fidelity, enabled by coupler-activated $XX$ interactions in the protected logical subspace. This work advances dual-rail architectures beyond single-qubit demonstrations, providing a blueprint for concatenated quantum error correction with erasure qubits.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review of Design Concerns in Superconducting Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16967v4)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this short review we describe the process of designing a superconducting circuit device for quantum information applications. We discuss the factors that must be considered to implement a desired effective Hamiltonian on a device. We describe the translation between a device's physical layout, the circuit graph, and the effective Hamiltonian. We go over the process of electromagnetic simulation of a device layout to predict its behavior. We also discuss concerns such as connectivity, crosstalk suppression, and radiation shielding, and how they affect both on-chip design and enclosure structures. This paper provides an overview of the challenges in superconducting quantum circuit design and acts as a starter document for researchers working on any of these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 11 figures; LaTeX: added more recent papers</p></details> |
| **[Dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting cavities: from photon generation to universal quantum gates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11361v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This chapter explores various aspects of the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) and its implications in the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). We begin by reviewing the origin and fundamental properties of the DCE, including three equivalent mathematical frameworks that offer complementary perspectives on the phenomenon. These formulations will serve as a foundation for the subsequent analyses. We then turn our attention to the practical realization of the DCE in cQED-based architectures, discussing how modern superconducting circuits can be engineered to exhibit this inherently quantum effect. Building on this, we examine how the presence of the DCE influences the performance of a quantum thermal machine operating with a quantum field, shedding light on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and thermodynamic processes. Further, we demonstrate how the DCE can be harnessed to implement a controlled-squeeze gate within a cQED platform, opening a path toward advanced quantum control and quantum information processing. The chapter concludes with a synthesis of the main results and a discussion of potential future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Measuring coherent dynamics of a superconducting qubit in an open waveguide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11028v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We measured the relaxation and decoherence rates of a superconducting transmon qubit in a resonator-free setting. In our experiments, the qubit is coupled to an open coplanar waveguide such that the transmission of microwaves through this line depends on the qubit's state. To determine the occupation of the first excited qubit energy level, we introduced a two-pulse technique. The first applied pulse, at a frequency close to the eigenfrequency of the qubit, serves to excite the qubit. A second pulse is then used for probing the transition between the first and second excited energy levels. Utilizing this measurement technique allowed for the reconstruction of the relaxation dynamics and Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consistency between the extracted parameters and the corresponding estimations from frequency-domain measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 8 pages, 3 figures.

We prove that at weak coupling the critical temperature for a sample confined to a quadrant in two dimensions is strictly larger than the one for a half-space, which in turn is strictly larger than the one for $\mathbb{R}^2$. Furthermore, we prove that the relative difference of the critical temperatures vanishes in the weak coupling limit.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 1 figure; published version</p></details> |
| **[Reducing leakage of single-qubit gates for superconducting quantum processors using analytical control pulse envelopes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17757v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the speed and fidelity of quantum logic gates is essential to reach quantum advantage with future quantum computers. However, fast logic gates lead to increased leakage errors in superconducting quantum processors based on qubits with low anharmonicity, such as transmons. To reduce leakage errors, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two new analytical methods, Fourier ansatz spectrum tuning derivative removal by adiabatic gate (FAST DRAG) and higher-derivative (HD) DRAG, both of which enable shaping single-qubit control pulses in the frequency domain to achieve stronger suppression of leakage transitions compared to previously demonstrated pulse shapes. Using the new methods to suppress the $ef$-transition of a transmon qubit with an anharmonicity of -212 MHz, we implement $R_X(\pi/2)$-gates achieving a leakage error below $3.0 \times 10^{-5}$ down to a gate duration of 6.25 ns without the need for iterative closed-loop optimization. The obtained leakage error represents a 20-fold reduction in leakage compared to a conventional Cosine DRAG pulse. Employing the FAST DRAG method, we further achieve an error per gate of $(1.56 \pm 0.07)\times 10^{-4}$ at a 7.9-ns gate duration, outperforming conventional pulse shapes both in terms of error and gate speed. Furthermore, we study error-amplifying measurements for the characterization of temporal microwave control pulse distortions, and demonstrate that non-Markovian coherent errors caused by such distortions may be a significant source of error for sub-10-ns single-qubit gates unless corrected using predistortion.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures in main text, 10 figures in Appendix</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting quantum oscillations and anomalous negative magnetoresistance in a honeycomb nanopatterned oxide interface superconductor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10912v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extremely low superfluid density and unprecedented tunability of oxide interface superconductors provide an ideal platform for studying fluctuations in two-dimensional superconductors. In this work, we have fabricated a LaAlO3/KTaO3 interface superconductor patterned with a nanohoneycomb array of insulating islands. Little-Parks-like magnetoresistance oscillations have been observed, which are dictated by the superconducting flux quantum h/2e. Moreover, an anomalous negative magnetoresistance (ANMR) appears under a weak magnetic field, suggesting magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. By examining their dependences on temperature, measurement current, and electrical gating, we conclude that both phenomena are associated with superconducting order parameter: The h/2e oscillations provide direct evidence of Cooper pair transport; the ANMR is interpreted as a consequence of multiple connected narrow superconducting paths with strong fluctuations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity and quantized anomalous Hall in rhombohedral graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12584v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics. Experimental efforts to date have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials typically amorphous metals and semiconducting quantum Hall or quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems. However, the interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials where the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here, we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling $\nu=-1$ as well as a superconducting state at $\nu-3.5$ at zero magnetic field. Remarkably, gate voltage can also be used to actuate nonvolatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further reveal a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at $\nu=2/3$-also stable at zero magnetic field-enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket, while leaving the topology of the $\nu=-1$ quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low-disorder limit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemical enhancement of superconductivity in LaRu3Si2 with mode-selective coupling between kagome phonons and flat bands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22477v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In kagome metals, flat electronic bands induced by frustrated hopping are a platform for strong electron correlations. In particular, a selective coupling of flat band states to certain kagome phonon modes is proposed as a universal origin of superconductivity in this material class. Here, we investigate the superconductivity in the kagome system LaRu$_3$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ by chemical pressure tuning while preserving the Ru-$4d$ states that constitute the kagome flat bands. We observe a sizable enhancement in the density of states up to $x = 0.07$, as determined by the specific heat, with a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. Ge-dopants induce a uniaxial lattice expansion along the $c$-axis. Our first-principles calculations suggest that this mitigates the detrimental effect of hybridization between kagome layers and reduces the dispersion of the Ru-$4d_{x^2-y^2}$ flat band. The calculated chemical potential moves closer to the maximum in the energy-dependent density of states. Our result is consistent with a theoretical prediction of tunable flat band superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ by mode-selective coupling between specific kagome phonons and the Ru-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures, 4 supplemental figures</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Casimir Force Across a Superconducting Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10579v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Casimir effect and superconductivity are foundational quantum phenomena whose interaction remains an open question in physics. How Casimir forces behave across a superconducting transition remains unresolved, owing to the experimental difficulty of achieving alignment, cryogenic environments, and isolating small changes from competing effects. This question carries implications for electron physics, quantum gravity, and high-temperature superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an on-chip superconducting platform that overcomes these challenges, achieving one of the most parallel Casimir configurations to date. Our microchip-based cavities achieve unprecedented area-to-separation ratio between plates, exceeding previous Casimir experiments by orders of magnitude and generating the strongest Casimir forces yet between compliant surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used for the first time to directly detect the resonant motion of a suspended membrane, with subatomic precision in both lateral positioning and displacement. Such precision measurements across a superconducting transition allow for the suppression of all van der Waals, electrostatic, and thermal effects. Preliminary measurements suggest superconductivity-dependent shifts in the Casimir force, motivating further investigation and comparison with theories. By uniting extreme parallelism, nanomechanics, and STM readout, our platform opens a new experimental frontier at the intersection of Casimir physics and superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-Orbital Intertwined Topological Superconductivity in a Class of Correlated Noncentrosymmetric Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10392v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Band Renormalization, Quarter Metals, and Chiral Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Tetralayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19474v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, exotic superconductivity emerging from a spin-and-valley-polarized metallic phase has been discovered in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. To explain this observation, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in driving flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, and in stabilizing superconductivity mediated by repulsive interactions. Though mean-field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Using this formalism, we find superconductivity arising from the spin-valley polarized phase for a range of electric fields and electron dopings. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a p-wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal-symmetry-broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures and supplementary material.

| **[Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279v5)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Numerical simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems, leading to two universal laws describing the nature of information dynamics.</p></details> | 6 figures, 26 pages |
| **[Cross-talk in superconducting qubit lattices with tunable couplers - comparing transmon and fluxonium architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10298v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-talk between qubits is one of the main challenges for scaling superconducting quantum processors. Here, we use the density-matrix renormalization-group to numerically analyze lattices of superconducting qubits from a perspective of many-body localization. Specifically, we compare different architectures that include tunable couplers designed to decouple qubits in the idle state, and calculate the residual ZZ interactions as well as the inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states. For transmon qubits outside of the straddling regime, the results confirm that tunable C-shunt flux couplers are significantly more efficient in mitigating the ZZ interactions than tunable transmons. A recently proposed fluxonium architecture with tunable transmon couplers is demonstrated to also maintain its strong suppression of the ZZ interactions in larger systems, while having a higher inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states than lattices of transmon qubits. Our results thus suggest that fluxonium architectures may feature lower cross talk than transmon lattices when designed to achieve similar gate speeds and fidelities.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07253v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed typos and updated Figures 6-10</p></details> |
| **[Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17709v3)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Imaging Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.</p></details> | 43 pages, 16 figures |

Oxygen descumming and argon milling are standard in situ cleaning methods employed for device preparation. We investigated the impact of these techniques on tantalum superconducting thin films using scanning tunneling microscopy at millikelvin temperatures. We demonstrate that these cleaning methods inadvertently introduce magnetic bound states within the superconducting gap of tantalum, likely by oxygen impurities. These bound states can be detrimental to superconducting qubit devices, as they add to dephasing and energy relaxation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Spin stiffnesses and stability of magnetic order in the lightly doped two-dimensional Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12191v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the density dependence of the spin stiffnesses and the stability of magnetic order with respect to quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model close to half-filling. The stiffnesses are computed from the spin susceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically ordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a moderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a N\'eel antiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a planar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon electron doping, the N\'eel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply. By contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop abruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and then increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite temperatures, the N\'eel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped regime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they vanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe the quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero upon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the quantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains N\'eel ordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range order in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with a spin gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Charge density wave solutions of the Hubbard model in the composite operator formalism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09903v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the charge density wave phase in the strongly correlated Hubbard model without any other broken symmetry phase. Starting from the atomic Hamiltonian with no hopping, we generate quasiparticle operators corresponding to holons and doublons in the strongly correlated limit of the repulsive Hubbard model. We develop a real space composite operator formalism using the equation of motion technique to include the intersite hopping perturbatively. Our fully self-consistent calculation stabilizes multiple unidirectional translation symmetry broken states within the doping range $\delta=0.07$ to $0.2$. The charge-ordered states become increasingly unfavorable with hole-doping. The unidirectional density waves manifest as periodic modulations of half-filled Mott regions separated by hole-rich regions. Notably, density wave solutions with periods of $3$ to $8$ lattice spacing remain energetically higher than those with larger periods. Quenched disorder on the charge-ordered states induces the merging of the Mott regions and, consequently, forms short-ranged charge modulations. The density of states shows signatures of strongly correlated Mott regions, potentially relevant to the physics of underdoped cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data files for initial guesses and converged solutions are provided as ancillary files.

Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms driving the magnetoresistivity behavior. We analyze the dependence of magnetoresistivity on temperature and the strength of the applied magnetic field, providing insights into the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and transport properties in AF systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intertwined fluctuations and isotope effects in the Hubbard-Holstein model on the square lattice from functional renormalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10863v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions are responsible for the formation of spin, charge, and superconducting correlations in layered quantum materials. A paradigmatic model for such materials that captures both kinds of interactions is the two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model with a dispersionless Einstein phonon. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the magnetic, density, and superconducting fluctuations at and away from half-filling. To that end, we employ the functional renormalization group using the recently introduced extension of the single-boson exchange formulation. More precisely, we go beyond previous approaches to the model by resolving the full frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex and taking into account the feedback from the electronic self-energy. We perform broad parameter scans in the space of Hubbard repulsion, electron-phonon coupling strength, and phonon frequency to explore the leading magnetic, density, and superconducting susceptibilities from the adiabatic to the anti-adiabatic regime. Our numerical data reveal that self-energy effects lead to an enhancement of the $d$-wave superconducting susceptibility towards larger phonon frequencies, in contrast to earlier isotope-effect studies. At small phonon frequencies, large density contributions to the $s$-wave superconducting susceptibility change sign and eventually lead to a reduction of $s$-wave superconductivity with increasing electron-phonon coupling, signaling the breakdown of Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We analyze our findings systematically, employing detailed diagnostics of the intertwined fluctuations and pinning down the various positive and negative isotope effects of the physical susceptibilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 24 figures; comments welcome</p></details> |

This phenomenon, occurring at half-filling, is influenced by the quantum phase transition between the alternating pair (AP) and paramagnetic (PM) phases at zero temperature. In this study, we leverage this anomalous behavior to investigate the performance of quantum many-body machines, using the EHM as the working substance. Our analysis reveals that the quantum Otto engine, when operating in the anomalous region, closely mimics the ideal Carnot engine. In this region, both the work output and thermal efficiency of the Otto engine increase, approaching the performance of a Carnot engine. This highlights the potential of many-body systems, such as the EHM, in enhancing quantum thermodynamic performance. Our findings demonstrate that, although the second law of thermodynamics prevents engines from surpassing Carnot efficiency, the Otto engine can operate remarkably close to this limit in the anomalous region, offering insights into new directions for future research on quantum thermodynamic cycles and working substances.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

In addition to the expected renormalization to the band structure, we find that the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction produces an anomalous spectral feature when electrons are added in the singlet channel but which is absent in the triplet channel. By comparing these results with those obtained from perturbation theory in the antiadiabatic limit, we demonstrate that this anomalous feature is a remnant of the strong electron-electron interaction mediated by the SSH coupling previously derived in the two-particle limit. By studying the evolution of this feature as a function of doping, we track the fate of this attraction to higher carrier concentrations and provide predictions for the spectral features to help guide future searches for strong e-ph mediated pairing.</p></details> | 7 figures |

Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations with a large number of states, we convincingly demonstrate the development of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) characterized by infinite-length stripes along the primitive vector of square lattice in models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'=-0.1\sim -0.3$ and doping $\delta \sim 14\%$. Intriguingly, analysis of pair-pair correlation functions along these stripes reveals incommensurate pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity with diverged susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of dominant PDW in the single-band Hubbard model on square lattices. At lower doping $\delta \sim 10\%$, we observed the formation of an additional CDW order within each stripe, which aligns across different stripes, forming a holon Wigner crystal phase. The spin pattern retains antiferromagnetic stripes with anti-phase domain walls. The ordering momentum of this emerged CDW order is remarkably close to the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs in the PDW phase, suggesting a multifaceted relationship between CDW and PDW ordering.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures + supplemental material</p></details> |

Accumulation of the resulting defects gives rise to the evolution in the micro-structure of the fuel which in turn brings about local tensions and strains in the fuel. One of the after effects due to evolution of micro-structure is the swelling of fuel which can damage the fuel cladding and cause environmental contamination by leakage of radioactive particles. Hence, it is vital to continually monitor the evolution of micro-structure and to analyze the changes in mechanical properties of the fuel. The study of elastic constants and analysis of their behavior is very helpful in understanding the mechanical properties of the fuel. In this research, using the Hubbard-corrected first-principles density-functional theory method, we have calculated the elastic constants of the uranium dioxide single crystal and compared the results with existing experimental data. In addition, using the Voigt, Reuss, and Hill models, we have estimated the mechanical properties for the poly-crystalline fresh fuel. The results show a very good agreement between the theory and experiment. Accordingly, we can reliably extend our method of calculations to the complicated system of irradiated fuel pellet, which is in the form of a poly-crystal and hosts various defects.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

This is a three-dimensional generalization of a similar mapping of the two-dimensional quantum Hall plateau transition to a one-dimensional Hubbard chain. We demonstrate that this mapping leads to the conclusion that the Weyl semimetal becomes a diffusive metal with a nonzero density of states at arbitrarily weak disorder, in agreement with recent work. We also discuss the absence of localization in strongly disordered Weyl semimetals from the viewpoint of this mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, published version</p></details> |

We then generalize it beyond square lattice and on-site Hubbard interactions and achieve better scaling in the number of sites within a unit cell, while there is substantial increase when there are more types of interactions.

In semiconductors, it drives the Rashba spin splitting and spin momentum locking, while in magnetic insulators based on transition metals, it induces anisotropic spin exchange interactions, like Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which drive chiral magnetism and skyrmion formation. Here, we establish a direct connection between SOC and spin exchange interactions by deriving an effective spin model from the SOC Hubbard model at half-filling. Using a strong-coupling expansion up to fourth order, we identify Heisenberg, Ising-like, and ring exchange interactions, as well as a variety of four-body terms for realistic Hubbard parameters. These parameters constrain the relative strengths of spin interactions, providing a natural interpolation between metallic and insulating phases that host complex magnetic textures.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasi-particle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states and the associated onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ scattering may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity in the cuprates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard test for this purpose, which requires an implementation of controlled single-particle fermionic operators. However, for a number of locality-preserving mappings to encode fermions into qubits, a direct construction of such operators is not possible. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm, which uses an analog of the Kubo formula adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly using only bilinears of fermionic operators and circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We test our new algorithm in practice by using open-access simulators of noisy IBM superconducting chips.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 29 figures, 4 tables, includes appendix</p></details> |

Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, we demonstrate the emergence of a topological Haldane phase, which results explicitly from the complementary effects of diagonal hopping-induced frustration and strong on-site Coulomb repulsion. The topological phase transition from a trivial insulator to the nontrivial Haldane phase is characterized by significant changes in magnetic properties, edge correlations, and the appearance of a nonzero string order parameter. Furthermore, we confirm the topological nature of this phase through a detailed analysis of the spin gap and entanglement spectrum, demonstrating clear signatures of symmetry-protected topological order.</p></details> | 12 pages, 16 figures |

We uncover the emergence of Floquet scarring states, a class of quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) states that defy random thermalization. The underlying physical mechanism is identified to be the Floquet resonances between these degenerate Fock bases that can be connected by one hopping process. It is the first-order hopping perturbation effect. Utilizing the degenerate Floquet perturbation theory, we derive the exact conditions under which the exotic QMBS states emerge. Phenomena such as quantum revivals and subharmonic responses are also studied. Those results open the possibility of modulating and engineering solid-state quantum many-body systems to achieve nonergodicity.</p></details> |  |

Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J > 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial Time Quantum Gibbs Sampling for Fermi-Hubbard Model at any Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01412v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been several advancements in quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling. These algorithms simulate the dynamics generated by an artificial Lindbladian, which is meticulously constructed to obey a detailed-balance condition with the Gibbs state of interest, ensuring it is a stationary point of the evolution, while simultaneously having efficiently implementable time steps. The overall complexity then depends primarily on the mixing time of the Lindbladian, which can vary drastically, but which has been previously bounded in the regime of high enough temperatures [Rouz\'e et al. arXiv:2403.12691 and arXiv:2411.04885]. In this work, we calculate the spectral gap of the Lindbladian for free fermions using third quantisation, and also prove a logarithmic bound on its mixing time by analysing corresponding covariance matrices. Then we prove a constant gap of the perturbed Lindbladian corresponding to interacting fermions up to some maximal coupling strength. This is achieved by using theorems about stability of the gap for lattice fermions. Our methods apply at any constant temperature and independently of the system size. The gap then provides an upper bound on the mixing time, and hence on the overall complexity of the quantum algorithm, proving that the purified Gibbs state of weakly interacting (quasi-)local fermionic systems of any dimension can be prepared in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (n^3 \operatorname{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$ time on $\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits, where $n$ denotes the size of the system and $\epsilon$ the desired accuracy. As an application, we explain how to calculate partition functions for the considered systems.

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance SC within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens SC by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens SC. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional SC of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K under I4/mmm space group. The susceptibility measurements confirm bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10.

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity.

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, achieving superconductivity in this system currently requires relatively high pressures. In this study, we propose a chemical pressure strategy via Sr substitution to stabilize high-Tc superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient conditions.Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1) at ambient pressure and identify two dynamically stable phases:La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$.Our calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallization of the $\sigma$-bonding bands dominated by Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals-a key feature associated with high-Tc superconductivity, as reported in the high-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Further analysis using tight-binding models shows that the key hopping parameters in La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$ closely resemble those of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, indicating that strong super-exchange interactions between interlayer Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals are preserved.

We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility via Fermi surface nesting, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML in our zero- and finite-temperature calculations. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

DFT+U calculations reveal that the A-type antiferromagnetic ground state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ persists throughout the studied pressure range. Electronic structure analysis shows that the Ni-$d_{xy}$ and Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level in both the $Fmmm$ and $Amam$ phases of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Phonon dispersion calculations for the $Fmmm$ phase reveal no imaginary modes from 12 to 29.5 GPa, confirming its dynamical stability in this pressure range. The vibrational frequencies of O atoms are substantially higher than those of Ni and La atoms, primarily due to the lower mass of oxygen. At 29.5 GPa, the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ for the $Fmmm$ phase is calculated to be 0.13. This small value suggests that conventional electron-phonon coupling is insufficient to explain the reported superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, indicating a potentially unconventional mechanism. The study offers nuanced, actionable insights that can strategically inform and direct subsequent experimental investigations into the design and optimization of nickel-based superconducting materials.</p></details> |  |

However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cell has significantly limited spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of the density waves and their interplay with superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that both the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are initially suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa. After the density wave collapse, a newly small charge gap associated to superconductivity opens at low temperatures. The extracted gap-to-T$_c$ ratio, $2\Delta_{SC}/ k_{B} T_{c} $, is found to be approximately 3, consistent with the weak coupling regime. These results suggest that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the layered nickelate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ with hybrid single-layer and bilayer stacking showed superconductivity under high pressure. This compound combines features of La$_2$NiO$_4$ and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but its pairing mechanism remains to be understood. Motivated by this finding, here we report a comprehensive theoretical study of this system. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the undistorted P4/mmm phase without pressure is unstable due to three distortion modes. Increasing pressure suppresses these modes and causes ``charge transfer'' between the single-layer and bilayer sublattices, leading to hole-doping in the single-layer blocks. Our random-phase approximation calculations indicate a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that arises from spin-fluctuation scattering between Fermi surface states mainly originating from the single-layer blocks and additional weaker contributions from the bilayer blocks. These spin-fluctuations could be detected by inelastic neutron scattering as a strong peak at ${\bf q}=(\pi, \pi)$. Our findings distinguish La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ from other nickelate superconductors discovered so far and the high-$T_c$ cuprates. We also discuss both similarities and differences between La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ and other hybrid stacking nickelates.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Microscopic insights into magnetism, which emerges near superconductivity, require a synergistic approach that combines complementary techniques with controlled parameter tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), resistivity, and specific heat measurements. At ambient pressure, two incommensurate spin density wave (SDW) transitions were identified at $T_{\rm SDW} \simeq 132$ K and $T^\ast \simeq 90$ K. NPD experiments revealed that the magnetic wave vector $(0, 0.574, 0)$ remains unchanged below 130 K, indicating that the transition at $T^\ast$ corresponds to a reorientation of the Ni magnetic moments within a similar magnetic structure. Comparison of the observed internal magnetic fields with dipole-field calculations reveals a magnetic structure consistent with an antiferromagnetically coupled SDW on the outer two Ni layers, with smaller moments on the inner Ni layer. The internal fields at muon stopping sites appeared abruptly at $T_{\rm SDW}$, suggesting a first-order-like nature of the SDW transition, which is closely linked to the charge density wave (CDW) order occurring at the same temperature ($T_{\rm SDW} = T_{\rm CDW}$). Under applied pressure, all transition temperatures, including $T_{\rm SDW}$, $T^\ast$, and $T_{\rm CDW}$, were suppressed at a nearly uniform rate of $\simeq -13$ K/GPa. This behavior contrasts with the double-layer RP nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where pressure enhances the separation of the density wave transitions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

This discovery of new family of high-temperature superconductors has garnered significant attention in the condensed matter physics community. In this work, we assume the this high-temperature superconductor is mediated by phonons and investigate the pairing symmetry in two distinct models: (i) the full-coupling case, where the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals are treated equally in both interlayer and intralayer coupling interactions, and (ii) the half-coupling case, where the intralayer coupling involves only the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, while the interlayer coupling is restricted to the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital. Our calculations reveal that the interlayer coupling favors an $s\pm$-wave superconducting state, whereas the intralayer coupling promotes an $s++$-wave symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications of pair-hopping interactions on the superconducting properties. These findings provide valuable insights into the pairing mechanisms and symmetry of this newly discovered high-temperature superconductor.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

The superconducting pairing symmetry is $s_\pm$-wave and is robust against the variation of the interaction strength. In this model, although the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are away from the Fermi level, the superconducting pairing function on them is not tiny. Instead, since the top of the $\gamma$ band and bottom of the $\delta$ band are both located at $\sim$500 meV away from the Fermi level, and they are almost nested by the peak structure in the spin fluctuation, thus by forming an anti-phase pairing function on them, these two bands act constructively to superconductivity. Finally with detailed derivation and numerical calculation, we demonstrate that the Fermi surface approximated Eliashberg equation may lead to deviation of the pairing symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.11429</p></details> |

However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.</p></details> |  |

In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Accompanying the superconductivity and a correlated insulator phase is the Kondo-lattice-like phenomenology in transport properties. Here we consider how such phenomenology can develop when the combination of the active bands are topological. We advance a unique construction of compact molecular orbitals through a partial Wannierization that is symmetry preserving. The resulting Anderson lattice model provides the basis for a microscopic understanding of the experimental observation, including the involved energy scales.

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11763v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band's natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters; 7 + 9 pages, 4 + 6 figures</p></details> |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe and WSe$_2$ nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to $2.2\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for SnSe$_2$ and up to $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for WSe$_2$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Schottky-barrier-height in high-symmetry 2D WSe$_2$: Momentum-space anisotropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11005v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is usually supposed that only low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit anisotropy, here we show that high-symmetry 2D semiconductors can show significant anisotropy in momentum space due to the band structure anisotropy in k-space. The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04131v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrupolar Excitons in MoSe$_2$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18040v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for platforms to generate and control exotic excitonic states has greatly benefited from the advent of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their heterostructures. Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript just accepted in Nature Communications.

| **[Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03361v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-valley polarization control in WSe$_2$ monolayers using photochemical doping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03049v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unconventional superconducting phases are distinguished by broken symmetries in their order parameters. Here, we report the discovery of an exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene at high displacement fields, marked by its coexistence with both a stripe charge order and the anomalous Hall effect. In angle-resolved transport measurements, the onset of stripe order is manifested as thermally activated insulating behavior along one axis, with highly conductive transport along the orthogonal direction. Upon cooling, superconductivity emerges exclusively along the high-conductivity axis, forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels. This anisotropic superconducting phase exhibits multiple first-order hysteretic transitions. Pronounced thermal hysteresis-between warming and cooling across the superconducting transition-suggests a melting transition of the underlying stripe phase. Additionally, magnetic-field-induced switching-similar to phenomena reported in tetra- and pentalayer graphene-supports the chiral nature of the superconducting state. Together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripy Hall crystal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with method section and SI, 5 figures in main text</p></details> |

The electromagnetic response of graphene coating characterized by the nonzero energy gap and chemical potential is described in the framework of the Dirac model by means of the polarization tensor. It is shown that the magnitude of the nonequilibrium Casimir pressure on a warmer plate than the environment is larger and on a cooler plate is smaller than the magnitude of the standard Casimir pressure in the state of thermal equilibrium. According to our results, the spatially local theory underestimates the role of the effects of nonequilibrium. This underestimation increases for asmaller chemical potential of the graphene coating and at lower temperatures of the cooled plate. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures; presented at the Fifth International Symposium on the Casimir Effect (Piran, Slovenia, September 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Stability of Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene in Ultra-High Vacuum and in Air](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11853v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was investigated via X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) for two different environmental conditions: ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and ambient pressure. The study is carried out by measuring the C 1s line shape evolution for two hydrogenated samples one kept in the UHV chamber and the other progressively exposed to air. In particular, the $sp^3$ relative intensity in the C 1s core-level spectrum, represented by the area ratio $\frac{sp^3}{sp^2+sp^3}$, was used as a marker for the hydrogenation-level and it resulted to vary by (4 $\pm$ 2)$\%$ in UHV after four months. Thus, a long-term stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was found, that indicates this material as a good candidate for hydrogen (or tritium) storage as long as it is kept in vacuum. On the other hand, the C 1s spectrum of the sample exposed to air shows a significant oxidation. A rapid growth up to saturation of the carbon oxides was observed with a time constant $\tau$ = 1.8 $\pm$ 0.2 hours. Finally, the re-exposure of the oxidised sample to atomic hydrogen was found to be an effective method for the recovery of hydrogenated graphene. This process was studied by carrying out both XPS and electron energy loss spectroscopy, the latter exploited to observe the CH stretching mode as a direct footprint of re-hydrogenation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Epitaxial formation of ultrathin HfO2 on graphene by sequential oxidation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11693v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate the formation of epitaxial, ultrathin hafnia (HfO2) on graphene. Monoclinic hafnia (m-HfO2) forms as the end of a series of sequential oxidation reactions. Starting from Hf metal grown epitaxially on graphene, oxidation leads first to an amorphous suboxide (a-HfOx), then to a crystalline, hexagonal suboxide (h-HfOx) in epitaxial relationship with the substrate, and finally to m-HfO2 that is also epitaxial. We use scanning transmission electron microscopy to characterize the epitaxial relationships and to investigate the structure of h-HfOx. We propose a series of displacive transformations that relate the different crystalline phases and are consistent with the observed epitaxial relationships with the graphene substrate. ReaxFF based reactive molecular dynamics simulations confirm our model of the oxide phase sequencing, and illustrate the role of graphene in promoting oxide crystallization. Our results suggest a way to achieve heteroepitaxial integration of high-performance, crystalline dielectrics with two dimensional (2D) semiconductors with an atomically sharp interface, which is also relevant to hafnia phase engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity and quantized anomalous Hall in rhombohedral graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12584v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics. Experimental efforts to date have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials typically amorphous metals and semiconducting quantum Hall or quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems. However, the interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials where the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here, we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling $\nu=-1$ as well as a superconducting state at $\nu-3.5$ at zero magnetic field. Remarkably, gate voltage can also be used to actuate nonvolatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further reveal a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at $\nu=2/3$-also stable at zero magnetic field-enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket, while leaving the topology of the $\nu=-1$ quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low-disorder limit.</p></details> |  |

To explain this observation, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in driving flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, and in stabilizing superconductivity mediated by repulsive interactions. Though mean-field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Using this formalism, we find superconductivity arising from the spin-valley polarized phase for a range of electric fields and electron dopings. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a p-wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal-symmetry-broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures and supplementary material.

| **[Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene with Wide Band Gap Opening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10238v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A thorough spectroscopic characterisation of highly hydrogenated monolayer graphene trasferred on TEM grids is herein reported. The graphene hydrogenation has the effect to distort the $sp^2$ arrangement of carbon atoms in the lattice toward a $sp^3$-like coordination, through the breaking of the $\pi$-bonds, as determined by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the C 1s core level. The hydrogen bonding was found to be favoured for a more distorted graphene lattice. Indeed, a 100$\%$ $sp^3$-saturation - the highest ever achieved - was observed after the hydrogenation of a sample with more pristine $sp^3$-like deformed bonds, while the flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, sample reached a 59$\%$ $sp^3$-saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy confirmed the photoemission result showing the $\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching, in the totally hydrogenated sample, and significant reduction, for the other one. High loading levels of hydrogenation were also witnessed by the opening of a wide optical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The observation of the C-H stretching vibrational mode is also reported, as a direct footprint of graphene hydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 59$\%$ saturated sample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation morphologies.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stability diagram of layer-polarized quantum Hall states in twisted trilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09406v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) platform, the rich beating patterns between the three graphene layers give rise to a plethora of new length scales and reconstructed electronic bands arising from the emergent moir\'e and moir\'e-of-moir\'e superlattices. The co-existing lattices and superlattices interact and compete with each other to determine the overall transport properties of tTLG, the hierarchy of which can be electrostatically controlled by tuning the out-of-plane charge distribution or layer polarization. In this work, we measure the stability diagram of layer-polarized quantum Hall states in tTLG by systematically mapping out layer-specific Chern numbers in each layer, and intra- and interlayer Chern transitions as a function of displacement field D and total carrier density n. In contrast to twisted bilayer systems, the rich interplay between the three atomic layers gives rise to a complex layer-polarized stability diagram with unconventional transport features that evolve rapidly with electric and magnetic fields. The stability diagram quantitatively characterizes the interlayer screening and charge distribution in tTLG with implication of strong inter-atomic-layer Coulomb coupling. Our work provides comprehensive guidance and insights into predicting and controlling layer-polarization and interlayer transitions in tTLG, and for tuning the individual role and interactions of each participating constituent towards novel material properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-dimensional Indium Oxide at the Epitaxial Graphene/SiC Interface: Synthesis, Structure, Properties, and Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09370v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality two-dimensional (2D) dielectrics are crucial for fabricating 2D/3D hybrid vertical electronic devices such as metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) based Schottky diodes and hot electron transistors, the production of which is constrained by the scarcity of bulk layered wide bandgap semiconductors. In this research, we present the synthesis of a new 2D dielectric, monolayer InO2, which differs in stoichiometry from its bulk form, over a large area (>300 um2) by intercalating at the epitaxial graphene (EG)/SiC interface. By adjusting the lateral size of graphene through optical lithography prior to the intercalation, we tune the thickness of InO2 where predominantly (~85%) monolayer InO2 is formed. The preference for monolayer formation of InO2 is explained using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, the band gap of InO2 is calculated to be 4.1 eV, differing from its bulk form (2.7 eV). Furthermore, MOS-based Schottky diode measurements on InO2 intercalated EG/n-SiC demonstrate that the EG/n-SiC junction transforms from ohmic to a Schottky junction upon intercalation, with a barrier height of 0.87 eV and a rectification ratio of ~10^5. These findings introduce a new addition to the 2D dielectric family, showing significant potential for monolayer InO2 to be used as a barrier in vertical electronic devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semimetallic two-dimensional defective graphene networks with periodic 4-8 defect lines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08699v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present theoretical simulations of the electronic properties of graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) carbon networks with a periodic arrangement of defect lines formed by alternating four- and eight-membered rings. These networks can be seen as arrays of armchair-edged nanoribbons (AGNRs), which are covalently connected at the edges. Using a combination of density functional theory and a simple tight binding model, we show that the electronic properties of these networks can be understood to arise from the family behaviour of the constituting AGNRs, plus a rigid shift due to an 'inter-ribbon' coupling across the defect lines. As a result, we find one class of zero-band-gap semiconducting 2D networks, and two classes of semimetallic networks with quasi-linear band close to the Fermi energy. The formation of closed-ring electron- and hole-like Fermi surfaces due to hybridization across the defect lines offers interesting perspectives of using such defective 2D networks for transport applications or the realization of carbon-based nodal line semimetals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gating monolayer and bilayer graphene with a two-dimensional semiconductor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06432v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metals are commonly used as electrostatic gates in devices due to their abundant charge carrier densities that are necessary for efficient charging and discharging. A semiconducting gate can be beneficial for certain fabrication processes, in low light conditions, and for specific gating properties. We determine the effectiveness and limitations of a semiconducting gate in graphene and bilayer graphene devices. Using the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), and tungsten diselenide (WSe2), we show that two-dimensional semiconductors can be used to suitably gate the graphene devices under appropriate operating conditions. For single-gated devices, semiconducting gates are comparable to metallic gates below liquid helium temperatures but include resistivity features resulting from gate voltage clamping of the semiconductor. In dual-gated devices, we pin down the parameter range of effective operation and find that the semiconducting depletion regime results in clamping and hysteresis from defect-state charge trapping.</p></details> | 33 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Significant ballistic thermal transport across graphene layers: effect of nanoholes and lithium intercalation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08244v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Porous graphene and graphite are increasingly utilized in electrochemical energy storage and solar-thermal applications due to their unique structural and thermal properties. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the lattice thermal transport and spectral phonon characteristics of holey graphite and multilayer graphene. Our results reveal that phonon modes propagating obliquely with respect to the graphene basal planes are the primary contributors to cross-plane thermal transport. These modes exhibit a predominantly ballistic nature, resulting in an almost linear increase in cross-plane thermal conductivity with the number of layers. The presence of nanoholes in graphene induces a broadband suppression of cross-plane phonon transport, whereas lithium ion intercalation shows potential to enhance it. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanisms governing cross-plane heat conduction in key graphene-based structures, offering valuable guidance for thermal management and engineering of van der Waals materials.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present synchrotron-based angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements focussing on the band structure of intercalated Pb under a single layer of epitaxial graphene. The interlayer Pb exhibits a metallic character, a $(1 \times 1)$ registry with respect to SiC, and free electron-like bands to a first order. Divergences from the free electron approximation include various band splittings and gaps throughout the Pb Brillouin zone. Light polarization dependent ARPES measurements indicate a predominant out-of-plane orbital character for the Pb bands, suggesting potential interactions between the interlayer Pb and graphene's $\pi$ orbitals that may induce proximity effects in graphene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a $(1 \times 1)$ Pb monolayer on SiC show a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed interlayer bands as well as the polarization dependent measurements. Finally, temperature dependent ARPES measurements reveal that the nearly charge-neutral graphene layer involves charge transfer from both the interlayer Pb and the substrate SiC.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages and 6 figures (and 3 pages of supplementary information with 6 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Stacking-induced ferroelectricity in tetralayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07935v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have reported emergent ferroelectric behavior in twisted or moir\'e-engineered graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures, yet the microscopic origin of this effect remains under debate. Pristine mono- or few-layer graphene lacks a permanent dipole due to its centrosymmetric lattice, making the emergence of ferroelectricity unlikely. However, mixed-stacked graphene, such as the ABCB tetralayer configuration, breaks both inversion and mirror symmetry and has been theoretically predicted to support electrically switchable dipoles. ABCB graphene represents the simplest natural graphene polytype exhibiting intrinsic out-of-plane polarization, arising from asymmetric charge carrier distribution across its layers. Here, we report robust ferroelectric behavior in dual-gated, non-aligned ABCB tetralayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. The device exhibits pronounced hysteresis in resistance under both top and bottom gate modulation, with the effect persisting up to room temperature. This hysteresis originates from reversible layer-polarized charge reordering, driven by gate-induced transitions between ABCB and BCBA stacking configurations -- without requiring moir\'e superlattices. Our findings establish stacking-order-induced symmetry breaking as a fundamental route to electronic ferroelectricity in graphene and open pathways for non-volatile memory applications based on naturally occurring mixed-stacked multilayer graphene.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elastic Screening of Pseudogauge Fields in Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02250v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice deformations in graphene couple to the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom as effective scalar and gauge fields. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the optical component of the displacement field, i.e., the relative motion of different sublattices, contributes at equal order as the acoustic component and effectively screens the pseudogauge fields. In particular, we consider twisted bilayer graphene and corrugated monolayer graphene. In both cases, optical lattice displacements significantly reduce the overall magnitude of the pseudomagnetic fields. For corrugated graphene, optical contributions also reshape the pseudomagnetic field and significantly modify the electronic bands near charge neutrality. Previous studies based on continuum elasticity, which ignores this effect, have therefore systematically overestimated the strength of the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field.

In order to observe hydrodynamics effects, a 2D device where the current flow is as inhomogeneous as possible is desirable. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction, which is related to a transition from a non-collective to a collective regime of transport, behaves non-monotonically with the magnetic field. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow and provide valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.</p></details> |  |

However, akin to the conventional ferroelectrics, the studies have predominantly reported semiconducting and/or insulating moir\'e systems and binary compounds. Spontaneous electric polarizations in elemental metallic phases remain scarcity. Here, we report the first optical imaging of intrinsic out-of-plane electric polarizations and domain wall (DW) sliding dynamics in tetralayer graphene, a 2D conductive layer composed entirely of carbon. Using scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), we directly visualize adjacent ABAC and ABCB stacking orders with intrinsic and opposite electric polarizations. Our gate-dependent SNOM measurements reveal distinct optical response that systematically changes upon carrier doping and unconventional interplay between DW sliding and electric polarizations, which are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Independent corroboration through Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and Raman spectroscopy confirms the polar nature and their polarization directions. Furthermore, reversible mechanical switching of polar states via atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip manipulation is also demonstrated. Our work establishes SNOM as a critical tool for probing sliding ferroelectricity in conductive 2D layers, opening avenues for exploring multiferroic behaviors and nonvolatile memory applications in atomically thin metals at room temperature.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages; 4 figures, 22 supplementary data figures, etc</p></details> |

A deep understanding of their properties can open channels for novel optoelectronic applications. By applying electric and magnetic fields, we investigate the influence of polaron interactions on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a graphene monolayer between a substrate and air. Using the density matrix approach, we derive the linear and nonlinear optical absorption coefficients and the relative refractive index by incorporating the zero-energy level. Our numerical results reveal that the polaron effect and the magnetic field induce shifts in the peak positions of the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index. Moreover, while the presence of electric and magnetic fields significantly alters the amplitude of the absorption coefficients, only the magnetic field affects the refractive index amplitude. Additionally, we find that the magnetic field amplifies the influence of surface optical phonons on the optical properties of graphene. These findings provide deeper insights into the optical behavior of graphene in external fields, which could be relevant for optoelectronic applications.</p></details> | 31 pages |

| **[Integrating Neural Networks and Tensor Networks for Computing Free Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12037v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing free energy is a fundamental problem in statistical physics. Recently, two distinct methods have been developed and have demonstrated remarkable success: the tensor-network-based contraction method and the neural-network-based variational method. Tensor networks are accu?rate, but their application is often limited to low-dimensional systems due to the high computational complexity in high-dimensional systems. The neural network method applies to systems with general topology. However, as a variational method, it is not as accurate as tensor networks. In this work, we propose an integrated approach, tensor-network-based variational autoregressive networks (TNVAN), that leverages the strengths of both tensor networks and neural networks: combining the variational autoregressive neural network's ability to compute an upper bound on free energy and perform unbiased sampling from the variational distribution with the tensor network's power to accurately compute the partition function for small sub-systems, resulting in a robust method for precisely estimating free energy. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted numerical experiments on spin glass systems with various topologies, including two-dimensional lattices, fully connected graphs, and random graphs. Our numerical results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method compared to existing approaches. In particular, it effectively handles systems with long-range interactions and leverages GPU efficiency without requiring singular value decomposition, indicating great potential in tackling statistical mechanics problems and simulating high-dimensional complex systems through both tensor networks and neural networks.</p></details> |  |

The central ingredient is a novel renormalization step that scales linearly with system size, i.e. from $L \to L+1$. The numerical accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art tensor network methods, while giving access to much more data points, and at a lower computational cost. Combining this contraction routine with the use of automatic differentiation, we arrive at an efficient algorithm for optimizing fully translation invariant projected entangled-pair states on the torus. Our benchmarks show that this method yields finite-size energy results that are comparable to those from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. When combined with field-theoretical scaling techniques, our approach enables accurate estimates of critical properties for two-dimensional quantum lattice systems.</p></details> |  |

Behind this construction lies a simple philosophy: holographic quantum entanglement can be visualized by thread-like objects. Inspired by tensor network models and the earlier concept of bit threads, we propose rules governing the trajectories of quantum threads in the holographic bulk. These rules not only carry meaningful interpretations at the level of quantum information theory but also determine that the quantum threads travel along geodesics in the holographic bulk. This makes kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing quantum thread configurations. We hope that the quantum thread method can provide necessary constraints or useful guidance for constructing genuine holographic tensor networks beyond toy models.</p></details> | 50 pages, 15 figures |

Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Tensor Network Quantum Emulators for Hamiltonian Simulation of Pharmaceutical Molecules: Challenges and Limitations in Drug Discovery Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11399v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing holds promise for revolutionizing computational chemistry simulations, particularly in drug discovery. However, current quantum hardware is limited by noise and scale, necessitating bridging technologies. This study provides an initial evaluation of tensor network quantum emulators, narrowed to matrix product state-based emulators, for Hamiltonian simulation of pharmaceutical molecules, with a focus on predicting the reactivity of targeted covalent drugs. We assess runtime scaling, accuracy, and resource requirements across various active space sizes, comparing performance to traditional state vector simulation methods. Our results reveal that, for accurate estimation of the expectation value trajectory of a key measurement operator - used as a quantum-derived feature for reactivity prediction - the required bond dimension in matrix product state tensor networks grows rapidly with system size, effectively negating runtime advantages for larger, chemically relevant molecules. This study highlights the fundamental challenges in classically simulating complex quantum chemistry systems and contributes to the support of the irreplaceability premise of quantum computers to efficiently handle strongly entangled systems. Such robustness of fault-tolerant quantum computers leads to practical advantages in drug discovery applications.</p></details> | 31 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Wave Simulation Using Tensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11181v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an efficient classical algorithm based on the construction of a unitary quantum circuit for simulating the Isotropic Wave Equation (IWE) in one, two, or three dimensions. Using an analogy with the massless Dirac equation, second order time and space derivatives in the IWE are reduced to first order, resulting in a Schr\"odinger equation of motion. Exact diagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks allows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid points on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into diagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix Product State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement when applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions with sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly efficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the wavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for carrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations such as Maxwell's equations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Algorithmic Advances Towards a Realizable Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10870v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method (QLBM) is one of the most promising approaches for realizing the potential of quantum computing in simulating computational fluid dynamics. Many recent works mostly focus on classical simulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues like observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain unsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum hardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to implement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer. Hardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density distribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented. Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation, significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators. Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |

Specifically, for random $T$-doped $N$-qubit Clifford circuits the computational cost of circuits prepared with magic state injection scales as $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(N))$ when the circuit has $t \lesssim N$ $T$-gates compared to an exponential scaling for the STN approach, which is demonstrated in systems of up to $200$ qubits. In the case of the Hidden Bit Shift circuit, a paradigmatic benchmarking system for extended stabilizer methods with a tunable amount of magic, we report that our magic state injected STN framework can efficiently simulate $4000$ qubits and $320$ $T$-gates. These findings provide a promising outlook for the use of this protocol in the classical modelling of quantum circuits that are conventionally difficult to simulate efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+7 p...</summary><p>5+7 pages, 3+5 figures</p></details> |

Within the well-established two-point measurement scheme and employing thermofield dynamics, we identify a 'heat operator,' whose moments with respect to the vacuum state correspond to the stochastic moments of the heat exchanged with a thermal bath. This recasts the computation of heat statistics as a standard unitary time-evolution problem, allowing us to leverage powerful tensor-network techniques for simulating quantum dynamics. In particular, we exploit the chain mapping of thermodynamic reservoirs to compute heat fluctuations in the Ohmic spin-boson model. The method, however, is general and applies to arbitrary open quantum systems coupled to non-interacting (bosonic or fermionic) thermal environments, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments and suggestions are welcome! 8 pages and 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Universal fault-tolerant logic with heterogeneous holographic codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10386v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of holographic bulk-boundary dualities has led to the construction of novel quantum error correcting codes. Although these codes have shed new light on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed to lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to support universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a new class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous holographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor network on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction generalizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated codes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the holographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high erasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed codes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes achieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\%$ reduction for a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard concatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a single logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations with tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal fault-tolerant gate sets. Therefore, our work strengthens the case for the utility of holographic quantum codes for practical quantum computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adiabatic Encoding of Pre-trained MPS Classifiers into Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09250v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) offer powerful methods for classification tasks, the training of QNNs faces two major training obstacles: barren plateaus and local minima. A promising solution is to first train a tensor-network (TN) model classically and then embed it into a QNN.\ However, embedding TN-classifiers into quantum circuits generally requires postselection whose success probability may decay exponentially with the system size. We propose an \emph{adiabatic encoding} framework that encodes pre-trained MPS-classifiers into quantum MPS (qMPS) circuits with postselection, and gradually removes the postselection while retaining performance. We prove that training qMPS-classifiers from scratch on a certain artificial dataset is exponentially hard due to barren plateaus, but our adiabatic encoding circumvents this issue. Additional numerical experiments on binary MNIST also confirm its robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation of Unprecedented Fractional Magnetization Plateaus in a New Shastry-Sutherland Ising Compound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12405v3)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Ge2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.</p></details> |  |

While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.</p></details> |  |

Here, we construct a realistic moir\'e lattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and filling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized Wigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moir\'e unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+11...</summary><p>12+11 pages, 6+10 figures</p></details> |

Motivated by the development of this new QML method, we explore how quantum-inspired techniques like tensor networks (TNs), specifically the Time Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) with Matrix Product State (MPS), can be used for the QELM algorithm. To demonstrate the utility of our quantum-inspired method, we performed numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset and compared the performance of our quantum-inspired QELM with different classical machine learning (ML) methods. The results reveal that high-quality embeddings can be generated by performing the time-evolution of MPS system consisting of one-dimensional chain of Rydberg atoms. This quantum-inspired method is highly scalable, enabling the simulation of 100 qubits with a low classical computing overhead. Finally, this study also underscores the potential of tensor networks as quantum-inspired algorithms to enhance the capability of quantum machine learning algorithms to study datasets with large numbers of features.</p></details> |  |

Although simulating general quantum dynamics is BQP-complete, tensor networks allow efficient simulation of short-time evolution in 1D systems. However, extending these methods to higher dimensions becomes significantly challenging when the area law is violated. In this work, we tackle this challenge by introducing an efficient classical algorithm for simulating short-time dynamics in 2D quantum systems, utilizing cluster expansion and shallow quantum circuit simulation. Our algorithm has wide-ranging applications, including an efficient dequantization method for estimating quantum eigenvalues and eigenstates, simulating superconducting quantum computers, dequantizing quantum variational algorithms, and simulating constant-gap adiabatic quantum evolution. Our results reveal the inherent simplicity in the complexity of short-time 2D quantum dynamics and highlight the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, particularly those confined to 2D topological structures.

| **[Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 16 pages, 18 figures |

We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.</p></details> | 37 pages, 16 figures |

The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$.

Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</p></details> |  |

Our benchmarks show that this method yields finite-size energy results that are comparable to those from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. When combined with field-theoretical scaling techniques, our approach enables accurate estimates of critical properties for two-dimensional quantum lattice systems.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06681v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 8 figures, article</p></details> |
| **[Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Frustrated Rydberg Atom Arrays Meet Cavity-QED: Emergence of the Superradiant Clock Phase](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05126v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rydberg atom triangular arrays in an optical cavity serve as an ideal platform for understanding the interplay between geometric frustration and quantized photons. Using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we obtain a rich ground state phase diagram. Around half-filling, the infinite long-range light-matter interaction lifts the ground state degeneracy, resulting in a novel order-coexisted superradiant clock (SRC) phase that completely destroys the fragile order-by-disorder (OBD) phase observed in classical light fields. According to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, this replacement may result from the competition between threefold and sixfold clock terms. Similar to the spin supersolid, the clear first-order phase transition at the $Z_2$ symmetry line is attributed to the nonzero photon density, which couples to the threefold clock term. Finally, we discuss the low-energy physics in the dimer language and propose that cavity-mediated nonlocal ring exchange interactions may play a critical role in the rich physics induced by the attachment of cavity-QED. Our work opens a new arena of research on the emergent phenomena of quantum phase transitions in many-body quantum optics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, comments are welcome and more information at http://cqutp.org/users/xfzhang/</p></details> |

The binding energy of trions agrees well with that observed in experiments, with position-dependent dielectric screening playing a significant role. For biexcitons, however, neither polaronic effects, nor dielectric confinement, nor electronic correlations -- here accounted for with a variational Quantum Monte Carlo method -- suffice to explain the large binding energies reported by single nanocrystal spectroscopy experiments. This result reinforces the hypothesis that biexcitons polarize the perovskite lattice differently from excitons and trions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic imaginary-time evolution in state-vector-based and shot-based simulations and on quantum devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04958v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaginary-time evolution, an important technique in tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms on classical computers, has recently been adapted to quantum computing. In this study, we focus on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the context of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are directly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the results with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables through repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the Heisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We further demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential of error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations for near-term digital quantum simulations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Elementary Excitations, Melting Temperature and Correlation Energy in Wigner Crystal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04538v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fully quantum-mechanical study of the energy-momentum dispersion of running waves, spin-conserving neutral excitations, and spin-reversal neutral excitations in a spin-polarized two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC). Our results show that the collective modes - plasmon and transverse sound - closely follow classical predictions even at surprisingly low values of $r_s \sim 8$. Furthermore, by extracting the shear modulus from the transverse sound speed, we find that quantum mechanical effects enhance the shear modulus at high densities, leading to a (Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young) melting temperature that exceeds the classical prediction. In addition, we apply the quasi-boson approximation to compute the correlation energy of the 2D WC based on its neutral excitation spectrum. While this approach underestimates the absolute correlation energy compared to quantum Monte Carlo results, it successfully captures the overall trend. These findings establish a robust quantum-mechanical foundation for understanding elementary excitations in Wigner crystals within low-dimensional electron systems and provide valuable theoretical insights for future experimental studies.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03882v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+15 ...</summary><p>8+15 pages, 3+7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03512v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and \mbox{(de-)confinement}. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Supersolid phase in two-dimensional soft-core bosons at finite temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03482v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The supersolid phase of soft-core bosons in two dimensions is investigated using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock and quantum Monte Carlo methods. An approximate phase diagram at finite temperatures is initially constructed using the mean-field approach, which is subsequently validated through precise path-integral simulations, enabling a microscopic characterization of the various phases. Superfluid and melting/freezing transitions are analyzed through the superfluid density and the long-range behavior of correlation functions associated with positional and orientational order, in accordance with the general picture of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. A broad region at low temperatures is identified where the supersolid phase exists, separating the uniform superfluid phase from the normal quasi-crystal phase. Additionally, a potential intermediate hexatic phase with quasi long-range orientational order is identified in a narrow region between the normal solid and fluid phases. These findings establish self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory beyond the local density approximation as an effective tool, complementary to computationally intensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, for investigating the melting of the supersolid phase and the possible emergence of the hexatic superfluid phase in bosonic systems with various interaction potentials.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Self-bound monolayer crystals of ultracold polar molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02682v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the physics of ultracold dipolar molecules using path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and construct the complete phase diagram extending from weak to strong interactions and from small to mesoscopic particle numbers. Our calculations predict the formation of self-bound quantum droplets at interaction strengths lower than previously anticipated. For stronger interactions, the droplet continuously loses superfluidity as correlations develop, and is eventually found to undergo a transition to a crystalline monolayer that remains self-bound without external confinement. The spontaneous formation of such two-dimensional phases from a three-dimensional quantum gas is traced back to the peculiar anisotropic form of the dipole-dipole interaction generated by microwave-dressing of rotational molecular states. For sufficiently large particle numbers, crystallization takes place for comparably low interaction strengths that do not promote two-body bound states and should thus be observable in ongoing experiments without limitations from three-body recombination.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Single-Particle Dispersion and Density of States of the Half-Filled 2D Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02614v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementing an improved method for analytic continuation and working with imaginary-time correlation functions computed using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we resolve the single-particle dispersion relation and the density of states (DOS) of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasi-particle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states and the associated onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ scattering may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity in the cuprates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Atom-based quantum simulators provide a new pathway to understand the microscopic mechanisms occurring at the heart of such systems. In this work, we explore two-dimensional attractive Fermi gases at the microscopic level by probing spatial charge and spin correlations in situ. Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal a marked dip in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Many such problems involve the analysis of securities modelled by complex dynamics that cannot be captured analytically, and hence rely on numerical techniques that simulate the stochastic nature of the underlying variables. These techniques may be computationally difficult or demanding. Hence, improving these methods offers a variety of opportunities for quantum algorithms. In this work, we study the problem of Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) which has significant importance in the valuation of derivative portfolios. As a variant, we also consider the problem of pricing a portfolio of many different financial options. We propose quantum algorithms that accelerate statistical sampling processes to approximate the price of the multi-option portfolio and the CVA under different measures of dispersion. Technically, our algorithms are based on enhancing the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms by Montanaro with an unbiased version of quantum amplitude estimation. We analyse the conditions under which we may employ these techniques and demonstrate the application of QMC techniques on CVA approximation when particular bounds for the variance of CVA are known.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 1 figure.

Quantum computers are expected to enable us to simulate large systems at finite temperatures, overcoming challenges faced by classical computers, like the sign problem of the quantum Monte-Carlo technique. Conventional methods suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) devices are designed for studying large-scale quantum many-body systems but require a large number of ancilla qubits and a deep quantum circuit with many basic gates, making them unsuitable for the early stage of the FTQC era, at which the availability of qubits and quantum gates is limited. In this paper, we propose a method suitable for quantum devices in this early stage to calculate the thermal-equilibrium expectation value of an observable at finite temperatures. Our proposal, named the Markov-chain Monte Carlo with sampled pairs of unitaries (MCMC-SPU) algorithm, involves sampling simple quantum circuits and generating the corresponding statistical ensembles. This approach addresses the issues of resource demand and the decay in probability associated with postselection of measurement outcomes on ancilla qubits. We validate our proposal with numerical simulation on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model as an illustrative example.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Our key findings are: (1) Besides the expected hole to electron-like behavior change around half filling, we show that the additional sign change at an electronic density $n_s$ (and correspondingly a hole density $p_s$) is controlled by the opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states or compressibility and not by the pseudogap scale in the single particle density of states. (2) We find that $n_s(T,U)$ depends strongly on the interaction $U$ and shows an unusual non-monotonic dependence on temperature with a maximum at a temperature $T\approx t$, on the order of the hopping scale. (3) We identify local moment formation close to half filling as the main driver for the anomalous behavior of the thermoelectric transport coefficient.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00405v4)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a topological structure: namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N\'eel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft information decoding with superconducting qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16228v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction promises a viable path to fault-tolerant computations, enabling exponential error suppression when the device's error rates remain below the protocol's threshold. This threshold, however, strongly depends on the classical method used to decode the syndrome measurements. These classical algorithms traditionally only interpret binary data, ignoring valuable information contained in the complete analog measurement data. In this work, we leverage this richer "soft information" to decode repetition code experiments implemented on superconducting hardware. We find that "soft decoding" can raise the threshold by 25%, yielding up to 30 times lower error rates. Analyzing the trade-off between information volume and decoding performance we show that a single byte of information per measurement suffices to reach optimal decoding. This underscores the effectiveness and practicality of soft decoding on hardware, including in time-sensitive contexts such as real-time decoding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120{\deg}, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Variational solution of the superconducting Anderson impurity model and the band-edge singularity phenomena](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18902v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a set of variational wavefunctions for the sub-gap spin-doublet and spin-singlet eigenstates of the particle-hole symmetric superconducting Anderson impurity model. The wavefunctions include up to two Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the continuum which is necessary to correctly capture the weak-coupling asymptotics in all parameter regimes. The eigenvalue problems reduce to solving transcendental equations. We investigate how the lowest singlet state evolves with increasing charge repulsion $U$, transitioning from a proximitized state (a superposition of empty and doubly occupied impurity orbitals, corresponding to an Andreev bound state) to a local moment that is Kondo screened by Bogoliubov quasiparticles (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state). This change occurs for $U = 2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the BCS gap. At this point, the band-edge effects make the eigenenergy scale in a singular way as $\Gamma^{2/3}$, where $\Gamma$ is the hybridization strength. Away from this special point, regular $\Gamma$-linear behavior is recovered, but only for $\Gamma \lesssim (U/2-\Delta)^2/\Delta$. The singular behavior thus extends over a broad range of parameters, including those relevant for some quantum devices in current use. The singular state is an equal-superposition state with maximal fluctuations between the local impurity charge configurations. Accurately capturing the band-edge singularity requires a continuum model, and it cannot be correctly described by discrete (truncated) models such as the zero-bandwidth approximation or the superconducting atomic limit. We determine the region of parameter space where the second spin-singlet state exists: in addition to the whole $U<2\Delta$ ABS region, it also includes a small part of the $U>2\Delta$ YSR region for finite values of $\Gamma$, as long as some ABS wavefunction component is admixed.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Noncentrosymmetric High-Temperature Superconductivity in doped $d^9$ Multiferroics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14314v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiferroics with $d^9$ electronic configurations, such as $SnCuO_2$, $PbCuO_2$, and $BiNiO_2$, exhibit coexisting antiferromagnetic order and ferroelectricity. Motivated by the fundamental link between symmetry breaking, strong electron correlations, and unconventional superconductivity, we propose a materials design strategy targeting noncentrosymmetric high-temperature superconductors through chemical doping of engineered $d^9$ multiferroics. This approach bridges two phenomena: (i) the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in correlated insulators, and (ii) the emergence of superconductivity in doped Mott/charge-transfer systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Quasiparticle-induced decoherence of a driven superconducting qubit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00769v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15400v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as \emph{unconventional magnets} because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where \emph{$d$-wave altermagnets} and \emph{$p$-wave magnets} are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 23 figures.

| **[Electronic nematic normal and superconducting state in electron-doped copper-oxide superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14077v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The similarities and differences between hole- and electron-doped cuprates are central to studies of high-temperature superconductivity. While electronic nematicity is found to be pervasive in hole-doped cuprates, iron-based superconductors, and other unconventional superconductors, evidence for electronic nematicity in electron-doped cuprates remains elusive. Here, we discover that the normal state of electron-doped Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 (SLCO) is nematic by the angle-resolved resistivity (ARR) method and the uncovered ground state at zero temperature is also nematic when superconductivity is suppressed by an applied magnetic field. As we deliberately change the substrate from tetragonal KTaO3(001) (KTO) to orthorhombic GdScO3(110) (GSO), the nematic director of SLCO is pinned by the epitaxial strain but the nematic amplitude remains roughly the same, implying that the nematicity originates from electron-electron correlations. The nematicity is significantly enhanced by the presence of superconducting fluctuations and its amplitude increases appreciably as the effective doping level of SLCO is lowered from optimal to underdoped. Thus, electronic nematicity is intrinsic to high-temperature superconductors regardless of differences in the structural and electronic configurations corresponding to hole or electron doping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing a Few Qubit Systems for Superconducting Hardware Compatibility and Circuit Design Sensitivity in Qiskit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14075v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current quantum computing ecosystem, building complex and integrated circuits for addressing real-world problems often involves using basic historical components like Bell states to take advantage of superposition, entanglement, and coherence. The availability of the simulator and the IBM quantum computing endeavor through Qiskit further broadens the scope of application based on domain use. In the NISQ era, however, error mitigation is a criterion that is applied when comparing a QPU run result with the simulator. As the real-world scope of application for quantum computing is being broadened, using simulators as a baseline offers confidence; however, concerns about computation resources and availability arise in the high-speed computational regime. As complex problems entail using a larger number of superconducting physical qubits, what should be the basis of framing a quantum circuit for building quantum algorithms in a real-world scenario, given hardware compatibility that should ideally provide confidence baselining with the simulator outcome? This work implements three base circuits for different qubit systems in the simulator and corresponding 127-qubit IBM Sherbrooke superconducting quantum processing units (QPU) to explore the tradeoff between generalizability, sensitivity of circuit design to parameters, noise resilience, resource planning, and efficient qubit usage insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Freestanding single-crystal superconducting electron-doped cuprate membrane](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13620v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thin films of cuprate superconductors are easier to control in terms of doping as compared to bulk samples. However, they require specific substrates to facilitate epitaxial growth. These substrates are often incompatible with materials used in electronic applications. Furthermore, it is challenging to separate the substrate's properties from the material of interest. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of an electron-doped cuprate membrane. We show that the membrane has a coherent crystal structure. Furthermore, the superconducting properties of the membrane post-liftoff closely resemble those of the thin films pre-lift-off, as revealed by a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope. Such membranes pave the way for designing new material properties and incorporating complex superconducting materials into typically incompatible electronic devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity with repulsion: a variational approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13556v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the stability of the superconducting state within mean-field theory in the presence of repulsive pairing interactions, focusing on multiband systems where such channels naturally arise. We show that, when repulsion is present, the self-consistent BCS solution appears as a saddle point of the conventional mean-field free energy, casting doubt on its physical stability. We show that this pathology is an artifact of using a non-variational functional. Recasting the problem with Bogoliubov's variational principle restores a free energy that is bounded from below and places the BCS solution at a genuine minimum. Using a two-band toy model relevant to iron-based superconductors, we demonstrate the stability of the s$_\pm$ state and clarify how projection schemes that rely only on the interaction matrix can misidentify the attractive eigenmode that drives pairing. Our results clarify the instability issue highlighted by Aase et al. and provide a consistent foundation for analyzing fluctuations in the presence of repulsive interactions.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Role of topotactic hydrogen in Superconductivity of Infinite-layer Nickelate NdNiO$_{2}$: A first-principles and variational Monte Carlo study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13399v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Employing combination of first-principles calculations, low-energy model construction, and variational Monte Carlo solution of the ab-initio derived Hubbard model, we study the effect of hydrogenation in the electronic structure and superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelate, NdNiO$_2$. We find that the introduction of hydrogen at the apical oxygen vacancy position strongly influences the Wannier function corresponding to the effective interstitial orbital at the Ni site bound to the hydrogen. This results in the near disappearance of the electron pocket at the $k_z$ = $\pi$ Fermi surface, keeping that of $k_z$ = 0 unchanged, compared to the dehydrogenated case. The two-band model thus remains valid even in the presence of H. The calculated superconducting order parameters both in absence and presence of H, show a two-hump superconductivity arising the two overlapping domes, one arising from $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and another arising from interstitial orbital degree of freedom. Hydrogenation strengthens the latter, marginally affecting the former.</p></details> | <details><summary>*Equa...</summary><p>*Equal contribution first author</p></details> |
| **[Resilient superconducting-element design with genetic algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01837v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present superconducting quantum circuits which exhibit atomic energy spectrum and selection rules as ladder and lambda three-level configurations designed by means of genetic algorithms. These heuristic optimization techniques are employed for adapting the topology and the parameters of a set of electrical circuits to find the suitable architecture matching the required energy levels and relevant transition matrix elements. We analyze the performance of the optimizer on one-dimensional single- and multi-loop circuits to design ladder ($\Xi$) and lambda ($\Lambda$) three-level system with specific transition matrix elements. As expected, attaining both the required energy spectrum and the needed selection rules is challenging for single-loop circuits, but they can be accurately obtained even with just two loops. Additionally, we show that our multi-loop circuits are robust under random fluctuation in their circuital parameters, i.e. under eventual fabrication flaws. Developing an optimization algorithm for automatized circuit quantization opens an avenue to engineering superconducting circuits with specific symmetry to be used as modules within large-scale setups, which may allow us to mitigate the well-known current errors observed in the first generation of quantum processors.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Planar Josephson junction devices with narrow superconducting strips: Topological properties and optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04468v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</p></details> | 22 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Synthetic $π$-flux system in 2D superconducting qubit array with tunable coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06743v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat-band systems provide an ideal platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, where the strongly suppressed kinetic energy in these flat energy bands suggests the potential for exotic phases driven by geometric structure, disorder, and interactions. While intriguing phenomena and physical mechanisms have been unveiled in theoretical models, synthesizing such systems within scalable quantum platforms remains challenging. Here, we present the experimental realization of a $\pi$-flux rhombic system using a two-dimensional superconducting qubit array with tunable coupling. We experimentally observe characteristic dynamics, e.g., $\pi$-flux driven destructive interference, and demonstrate the protocol for eigenstate preparation in this rhombic array with coupler-assisted flux. Our results provide future possibilities for exploring the interplay of geometry, interactions, and quantum information encoding in such degenerate systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+14 ...</summary><p>6+14 pages, 4+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Optical absorption activated by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse in metallic and superconducting states of the Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00313v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses unlocks the potential of pump-probe spectroscopy in sub-femtosecond timescale. Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Layer Pseudospin Superconductivity in Twisted MoTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12767v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments have observed signatures of spin-valley-polarized unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$). Here, we explore the rich physics of superconducting tMoTe$_2$, enabled by its unique layer-pseudospin structure. Within a minimal two-orbital layer-pseudospin model framework, both interlayer and intralayer Cooper pairings can be effectively visualized using a layer-space Bloch sphere representation. Remarkably, we find that interlayer pairing prevails in the spin-valley-polarized state, whereas intralayer pairing dominates in the spin-valley-unpolarized state. Strikingly, we further predict that for spin-valley-polarized intravalley superconducting state, experimentally feasible weak displacement fields can stabilize finite-momentum pairings at low temperatures. Additionally, in-plane magnetic fields, which break three-fold rotational symmetry, induce field-direction-dependent finite-momentum pairing states, leading to a versatile momentum-selection phase diagram. Our work highlights the crucial role of layer pseudospin in tMoTe$_2$'s unconventional superconductivity and demonstrates its unique tunability via external fields.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Superconductivity and inhomogeneous charge-ordered state in the two-Dimensional Hubbard model -- Off-Diagonal Wave Function Monte Carlo Studies of Hubbard Model IV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12736v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the ground-state properties of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, based on the off-diagonal wave function variational Monte Carlo method. We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.</p></details> | 10 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Theoretical study on the possibility of high $T_c$ s$\pm$-wave superconductivity in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21461v3)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Unconventional superconductivity in a non-centrosymmetric $α$-Mn alloy NbTaOs$_{2}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12449v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-centrosymmetric superconductors have emerged as a fascinating avenue for exploring unconventional superconductivity. Their broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries make them prime candidates for realizing the intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE). In this work, we synthesize the ternary non-centrosymmetric $\alpha$-Mn alloy NbTaOs$_{2}$ and conduct a comprehensive investigation of its superconducting properties through resistivity, magnetization, specific heat and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) techniques. Our transverse field-$\mu$SR and specific heat results provide evidence of a moderately coupled, fully-gaped superconducting state. Zero field-$\mu$SR measurements reveal a subtle increase in the relaxation rate below the transition temperature, suggesting time reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting ground state of NbTaOs$_{2}$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Zigzag antiferromagnets in the SU(3) Hubbard model on the square lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14703v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SU(N) Hubbard models exhibit a rich variety of phases, which may be realized through quantum simulation with ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. In this work we study the Mott insulating phases of the SU(3) Hubbard model at 1/3-filling using infinite projected entangled-pair states, optimized with both imaginary time evolution and variational optimization. In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of generalized Hubbard models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10314v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |
| **[First-principles electron-phonon interactions with self-consistent Hubbard interaction: an application to transparent conductive oxides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08269v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ab initio computational method known as Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+$U$) captures well ground electronic structures of a set of solids that are poorly described by standard DFT alone. Since lattice dynamical properties are closely linked to electronic structures, the Hubbard-corrected density functional perturbation theory (DFPT+$U$) can calculate them at the same level of accuracy. To investigate the effects of $U$ on electron-phonon (el-ph) interactions, we implemented DFPT+$U$ with a Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism to determine $U$ self-consistently and applied our method to compute optical and transport properties of transparent conductive oxides of CdO and ZnO. For CdO, we find that opening a band gap due to $U$ restores the long-range Fr\"ohlich interaction and that its calculated mobility and absorption spectrum are in excellent agreement with experiments. For ZnO where a band gap already appears at the DFT level, DFPT+$U$ brings the results into much closer alignment with experiment, thus demonstrating improved accuracy of our method in dealing with el-ph interactions in these technologically important materials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Resonant dynamics of dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model with time-dependent tensor electric fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13159v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, tensor gauge fields and their coupling to fracton phases of matter have attracted more and more research interest, and a series of novel quantum phenomena arising from the coupling has been predicted. In this article, we propose a theoretical scheme to construct a time-dependent rank-2 tensor electric field by introducing a periodically driving quadratic potential in a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, and investigate the dynamics of dipole and fracton excitations when the drive frequency is resonant with the on-site interaction. We find that the dynamics are dominated by the splitting of large dipoles with the photon-assisted correlated tunneling and the movement of small dipoles, both of which can be well controlled by the drive amplitude. Our work provides a possible approach for engineering the dynamics of dipole-conserving quantum systems via tensor gauge fields.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.</p></details> | 10 pages, 21 figures |

Remarkably, it was also recently realized that shielded polar molecules exhibit an SU(N) symmetry among their hyperfine states, opening the door to SU(N) systems with larger N, bosonic particle statistics, and tunable interactions -- both repulsive and attractive. Motivated by these results, we have studied the SU(3) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on a square lattice. Using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method, we explore the finite-temperature phase diagram and provide evidence for three distinct regions -- a three-component Fermi liquid (FL) region, a "trion" liquid (TL) region, and an ordered Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW phase is stable at finite temperature (in contrast to the SU(2) CDW), while the FL to TL crossover appears to point to a quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Our method extends straightforwardly to larger N and is sign-problem free for even values of N. With these results, we demonstrate the potential physics enabled by using polar molecules as a quantum simulation platform for the attractive SU(N) FHM.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 pages of supplemental material (with 3 supplemental figures)</p></details> |

Inspired by the large lattice constants of moir\'e materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+17...</summary><p>14+17 pages, 3+3 figures. v2: improvements and references added in response to referee comments; refined appendix on edge states</p></details> |

Recently, progress in quantum simulators has enabled the measurement of site resolved snapshots of Fermi-Hubbard systems at finite doping on square as well as triangular lattice geometries. These experimental advances pose the quest for theorists to analyze the ensuing data in order to gain insights into these prototypical, strongly correlated many-body systems. Here we employ machine learning techniques to optimize the mean-field parameters of a resonating valence bond (RVB) state through comparison with experimental data, thus determining a possible underlying simple model that is physically motivated and fully interpretable. We find that the resulting RVB states are capable of capturing two- as well as three-point correlations measured in experiments, even when they are not specifically used in the optimization. The analysis of the mean-field parameters and their doping dependence can be used to obtain physical insights and shed light on the nature of possible underlying quantum spin liquid states. Our results show that finite temperature data from Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators can be well captured by RVB states. This work paves the way for a new, systematic analysis of data from numerical as well as quantum simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary lattice.</p></details> |  |

The phenomenon was recently observed with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. Here, we explore the kinetic ferromagnetism within the square lattice Hubbard model and its strong-coupling counterpart, the $t-J$ model, at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit via numerical linked-cluster expansions. We find evidence of ferromagnetic Nagaoka polarons at dopings up to $\sim 30\%$ away from half filling for a variety of interaction strengths and at temperatures as low as $0.2$ of the hopping energy. We map out the boundaries of this phase through analyzing various correlation functions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

Collective phenomena like quantum phase transitions of ultracold atoms are addressed by harnessing density fluctuations. Here, we calculate the DSF of a nonequilibrium spinless Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) from the perspective of dissipative phase transition (DPT) in a steady state. Our methodology uses a homogeneous mean-field approximation to make the single-site hierarchy simpler and applies the Lindbladian perturbation method (LPM) to go beyond the single site, limited by the ratio of the inter-site hopping term to the Liouvillian gap as a small parameter. Our results show that the DSF near a DPT point is characteristically different from that away from the transition point, providing a clear density spectral signature of the DPT. In addition to comparing the two numerical frameworks, the mean-field results serve as a benchmark for proof-of-principle robustness of LPM. Despite the numerical difficulty, our methodology provides a computationally accessible route for studying density fluctuations in an open lattice quantum system without requiring large-scale computation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide an experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

The interplay between the superlattice potential depth $\Delta/t$ and the onsite interaction $U/t$ gives rise to three distinct quantum phases at zero temperature: a superfluid phase, a Mott insulator I phase with unit filling on each site, and a Mott insulator II phase characterized by density imbalance-double occupancy on one sublattice and vacancy on the other at unit filling. The SF-MI transitions are found to be continuous, consistent with second-order quantum phase transitions. We further extend our analysis to finite temperatures within the superfluid regime. Our work highlights how a honeycomb superlattice geometry enables access to interaction- and lattice-modulation-driven quantum phases, including a density-imbalanced Mott insulator and a robust superfluid regime, offering concrete theoretical predictions for cold-atom experiments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18639v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 20 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.04740</p></details> |

In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments.

| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to a unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetically ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest a simultaneous formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ , thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Unconventional Superconducting Pairing Symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: from the Perspective of Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) (HTSC) in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with critical temperature $T_c$ higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has aroused a surge in the exploration of HTSC in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase multilayer nickelates. Very recently, SC is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ substrate with $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40\text{ K}$) at ambient pressure (AP), allowing various experimental investigation on the pairing mechanism in this material. It is now eager to enhance the $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Here we propose that an imposed strong perpendicular electric field can strongly enhance the $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. The physics underlying this proposal is clear and simple. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this layer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly enhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study and comprehensive two-orbital one under the mean-field treatment and the density matrix renormalization group approach consistently verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers is enough to realize HTSC with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15906v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors. This work lays the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical investigations into the unique electronic properties of these emerging materials.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures and appendix</p></details> |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incommensurate spin-fluctuations and competing pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05254v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K under I4/mmm space group. The susceptibility measurements confirm bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Our research provides a new platform for the investigation of the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in Ruddlesden-Popper trilayer perovskite nickelates.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity.

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, achieving superconductivity in this system currently requires relatively high pressures. In this study, we propose a chemical pressure strategy via Sr substitution to stabilize high-Tc superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient conditions.Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1) at ambient pressure and identify two dynamically stable phases:La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$.Our calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallization of the $\sigma$-bonding bands dominated by Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals-a key feature associated with high-Tc superconductivity, as reported in the high-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Further analysis using tight-binding models shows that the key hopping parameters in La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$ closely resemble those of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, indicating that strong super-exchange interactions between interlayer Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals are preserved. These findings suggest that Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a promising candidate for realizing high-Tcsuperconductivity at ambient pressure.</p></details> |  |

Tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$), in particular, has emerged as a promising solar cell absorber. However, defective metal-semiconductor interfaces have restricted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to approximately 6%. Here we report WSe$_2$ photovoltaics with a record-high PCE of approximately 11% enabled by ultra-clean indium/gold (In/Au) van der Waals (vdW) contacts. Using grid-patterned top vdW electrodes, we demonstrate near-ideal diodes with a record-high on/off ratio of $1.0\times 10^9$. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 571 +/- 9 mV, record-high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 27.19 +/- 0.45 mA cm$^{-2}$ -- approaching the theoretical limit (34.5 mA cm$^{-2}$) -- and fill factor of 69.2 +/- 0.7% resulting in PCE of 10.8 +/- 0.2% under 1-Sun illumination on large active area (approximately 0.13x0.13 mm$^2$) devices have been realised. The excellent device performance is consistent with the high external quantum efficiency (up to approximately 93%) measured across a broad spectral range of 500-830 nm. Our results suggest that ultra-clean vdW contacts on WSe$_2$ enable high-efficiency photovoltaics and form the foundation for further optimisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main manuscript with four figures and supplementary figures</p></details> |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

However, current ab initio approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe$_2$, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s-4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</p></details> |  |

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Harnessing their full potential requires understanding both intrinsic transport and the dynamics of optically excited spin and charge carriers -- particularly the transition between excited spin polarization and the conduction band's intrinsic spin texture. Here, we investigate the spin polarization of the conduction bands of bulk WSe$_2$ using static and time-resolved spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, complemented by photocurrent calculations. Electron doping reveals the intrinsic spin polarization, while time-resolved measurements trace the evolution of excited spin carriers. We find that intervalley scattering is spin-conserving, with spin transport initially governed by photoexcited carriers and aligning with the intrinsic conduction band polarization after $\sim$150 fs.</p></details> |  |

This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures.

We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03361v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

Here, we demonstrate that exposing WSe$_2$ to chloroform provides simple and stable p-type doping. In monolayer WSe$_2$ transistors with Pd contacts, chloroform increases the maximum hole current by over 100$\times$ (>200 $\mu$A/$\mu$m), reduces $R_\textrm{C}$ to ~2.5 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m, and retains an on/off ratio of $10^{10}$ at room temperature. These improvements persist for over 8 months, survive annealing above 150 {\deg}C, and remain effective down to 10 K, enabling a cryogenic $R_\textrm{C}$ of ~1 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Density functional theory indicates that chloroform strongly physisorbs to WSe$_2$, inducing hole doping with minimal impact on the electronic states between the valence band and conduction band edges. Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy reveal that chloroform intercalates at the WSe$_2$ interface with the gate oxide, contributing to doping stability and mitigating interfacial dielectric disorder. This robust, scalable approach enables high-yield WSe$_2$ transistors with good p-type performance.</p></details> |  |

However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p></details> |  |

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |

Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band's natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters; 7 + 9 pages, 4 + 6 figures</p></details> |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Devices with four- and eight-layer differentiated contacts were analyzed, revealing that in a nanoribbon geometry (four contacts), a longitudinal counterflow current emerges in the top layer, while in a square-junction configuration (eight contacts), this counterflow is accompanied by a transverse, or Hall, component. These effects persist despite weak coupling to contacts, onsite disorder, lattice relaxation and variations in device size. The observed counterflow response indicates a circulating interlayer current, which generates an in-plane magnetic moment excited by the injected current. Finally, due to the intricate relationship between the electrical layer response, energy, and twist angle, a clusterized machine learning model was trained, validated, and tested to predict various conductances.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages and 8 figures</p></details> |

Here, the resonant Raman scattering will be utilized to study an exciton-phonon interaction in GaN nanocrystals, further enhanced by the underlying graphene. Raman spectroscopy using various excitation energies shows how the exciton-phonon interaction behaves, unveiling the scattering strength. The origin of the interaction is in the condition of resonance, which is directly observed in the temperature resolved spectra. Most importantly, the underlying graphene strongly enhances the coupling of phonons and excitons. Consequently, an enhanced resonant Raman spectrum of GaN nanocrystals possessing clearly observable phonon overtones up to the 4th order has been obtained. It has been demonstrated that the responsible effect is the electron transfer between nanocrystals and the underlying graphene. The utilization of such an increased coupling effect can be beneficial for a study of the charge carrier scattering in semiconducting nanomaterials, analysis of their crystal quality, improvement of sensor sensitivity and in the subsequent development of new-generation optoelectronic devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hetero-Orbital Two-Component Fractional Quantum Hall States in Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14188v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A two-dimensional electron system exposed to a strong magnetic field produces a plethora of strongly interacting fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, the complex topological orders of which are revealed through exotic emergent particles, such as composite fermions, fractionally charged Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. Much insight has been gained by the study of multi-component FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron contribute additional correlation. Traditional multi-component FQH states develop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and the resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature was also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study "hetero-orbital" two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part of the pseudospin, rendering the multi-component interactions strongly SU(2) anisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene at the isospin transition between N = 0 and N = 1 electron Landau levels, are markedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In particular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-flux and reverse-flux composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component 2/5 state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at a high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations, reveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects, significantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures including appendices</p></details> |

This enables the inclusion of excitonic effects in the optical phonon dispersions and lifetimes of graphene, both near the center ($\Gamma$) and at the border (K) of the Brillouin zone, at phonon momenta relevant for Raman scattering and for the onset of the intrinsic electrical resistivity. Near K, we find a phonon red-shift of ~150 $cm^{-1}$ and a 10x enhancement of the group velocity, together with a 5x increase in linewidths due to a 26x increase of the electron-phonon matrix elements. These effects persist for doping $2E_{F} < {\hbar}{\omega}_{ph}$ and are quenched at higher dopings. Near $\Gamma$, the excitonic effects are minor because of the gauge field nature of the electron-phonon coupling at small phonon momentum.</p></details> |  |

We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule.

According to these authors, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". To bring the predictions of quantum field theory in agreement with those following from the Kubo model, the modified expression was used which relates the conductivity and the polarization tensor. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages; comment on arXiv:2403.02279v3</p></details> |

The epitaxial growth of Pb monolayers on SiC(0001), combined with the relatively large spacing of the suspended graphene, makes this system particularly distinctive. Using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and various microscopy techniques -- including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) -- we have investigated the intercalation process across multiple length scales. Our analysis reveals the formation of different 2D Pb monolayer phases, such as stripes and hexagons, which emerge due to the interplay between substrate pinning and strain within the Pb layer, depending on local coverage. These findings provide new insights into the strain-driven stabilization of intercalated metal layers and highlight the potential of graphene as a versatile platform for engineering low-dimensional materials.</p></details> |  |

Strong carrier-lattice interaction evolved from the out-of-plane soft vibrations with accumulation of charges at the out-of-plane region, can set a favorable environment for CO in graphene system. Here, we employ boron-doped reduced graphene oxide (BG) to acquire charge-ordered state above a transition temperature, T1~97.5 K. Signatures of this state are identified using ab-initio simulations and low temperature electrical transport measurements. The out-of-plane boron groups play a crucial role in reinforcing the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) allowing an ordered-state transition. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy further supports the emergence of ordering. Key characterization techniques (X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra etc.) are used to quantify the EPC interaction and associated factors like tensile strain, boundary defects, etc. affecting charge ordering with doping. Additionally, we find interesting electric field dependency on the CO in this non-metallic, light-atom-doped chemically derived graphene.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present a unified dynamic model that captures the essential physics of the GFET response under periodic gate modulation, accounting for both intrinsic relaxation processes and externally driven charge transfer. By modeling non-equilibrium carrier dynamics as a competition between injection and reabsorption rates, we uncover two distinct regimes: one governed by intrinsic, frequency-independent relaxation and another exhibiting frequency-locked behavior where the response is tied to the external drive. This distinction resolves apparent nonvolatile effects and explains loop invariance in floating-gate structures via displacement current-driven charge injection. Our framework predicts the evolution of the hysteresis loop shape, amplitude, and direction across a wide range of driving conditions, offering a versatile tool for interpreting experimental results and guiding the design of next-generation graphene-based electronic systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Here, we report displacement-field-induced band inversion and modulation of the Berry phase of low-energy quasi particles in high-mobility Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). Using quantum oscillations, we track the evolution of the Fermi surface and topological properties of Dirac-like gully bands that emerge under a finite interlayer potential. We observe a striking sequence of transitions: at low displacement field $D$, the gullies are characterized by a Berry phase of $2\pi$ and large effective mass, indicating massive fermions. As $D$ increases, the Berry phase abruptly shifts to $\pi$ and the effective mass reaches a minimum, signaling the onset of massless Dirac behavior. At higher $D$, the Berry phase returns to $2\pi$, and the effective mass increases again, consistent with a band inversion. These findings demonstrate a rare, reversible topological phase transition - massive to massless to massive - driven entirely by an external displacement field. Despite robust theoretical predictions [\textit{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{87}, 085424 (2013), \textit{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{87}, 115422 (2013), and \textit{Phys. Rev.

In a semiconductor, condensation occurs when the exciton binding energy matches the band gap. This binding energy results from a balance between Coulomb attraction, which enhances it, and kinetic energy, which suppresses it. However, reducing kinetic energy typically increases screening, weakening Coulomb attraction. Empirically, in most candidate materials, the binding energy remains below the band gap, with few external parameters capable of altering this balance. Here, we propose an in-plane electric field as a control parameter. This field induces hybridisation between even- and odd-parity excitons, and the resulting level repulsion effectively enhances binding energy. We argue that this mechanism is generic to excitons in semiconductors and illustrate it with a model of biased bilayer graphene. Bilayer graphene is chosen since it has a tunable band gap, making it an excitonic condensate candidate and moreover, the Zener tunnelling rate contains, in addition to the usual exponential decay, a non-standard oscillating component -- thanks to details of the electron dispersion. Analogous to quantum oscillations, we propose that Fourier spectrum of the current-voltage data allows for a novel test of exciton condensation. Finally, we show that the is a large excitonic gap to critical temperature ratio -- a clear prediction for STM studies.</p></details> |  |

Quasi-particle corrections and excitonic effects are addressed within the GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation, respectively. Both effects are essential in the description of the EEL spectra to obtain a quantitative agreement with experiments, with the position, dispersion, and shape of both the excitation gap and the $\pi$ plasmon being significantly affected by excitonic effects.</p></details> |  |

However, direct electrical measurements of GNIs have been challenging due to the requirement of metal catalysts in typical synthesis methods. In this study, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of GNIs by using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition, which is a catalyst-free method to deposit graphene directly on SiO$_2$ substrates. This approach enables the fabrication of metal electrodes on GNIs, allowing us to measure their quantum transport properties. At low temperatures, one of our devices shows clear Coulomb diamonds with twofold degeneracy, indicating the formation of quantum dots and the vanishing of valley degeneracy. The charge state of the GNI is also modulated by a local side gate, and the tunneling coupling between leads and quantum dots is modulated by changing contact area and metal materials. These results provide device design guidelines toward GNI-based quantum devices for next-generation computing.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

In 2d and at long wavelengths, they couple to light and act as the system polaritons. They also dictate the scattering of charged carriers. Van der Waals heterostructures offer the opportunity to couple excitations from different layers via long-range Coulomb interactions, modifying both their dispersion and their scattering of electrons. Even when the excitations do not couple, they are still influenced by the screening from all layers, leading to complex dynamical interactions between electrons, plasmons and polar phonons. We develop an efficient ab initio model to solve the dynamical electric response of Van der Waals heterostructures, accompanied by a formalism to extract relevant spectroscopic and transport quantities. Notably, we obtain scattering rates for electrons of the heterostructure coupling remotely with electrodynamic excitations. We apply those developments to BN-capped graphene, in which polar phonons from BN couple to plasmons in graphene. We study the nature of the coupled excitations, their dispersion and their coupling to graphene's electrons. Regimes driven by either phonons or plasmons are identified, as well as a truly hybrid regime at long wavelengths. Those are studied as a function of the graphene's Fermi level and the number of BN layers. In contrast with descriptions in terms of surface-optical phonons, we find that the electron-phonon interaction stems from different modes. Moreover, the dynamical screening of the coupling between BN's LO phonons and graphene's electrons crosses over from inefficient to metal-like depending on the relative value of the phonons' frequency and the energetic onset of interband transitions. While the coupling is significant in general, the associated scattering of graphene's carriers is found to be negligible in the context of electronic transport.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 18 figures.

We identify that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. Operationally, this measure quantifies how well an operator can be approximated by one with only a few Pauli strings -- analogous to how entanglement entropy relates to tensor-network truncation. A notable advantage of operator stabilizer entropies is their inherent locality, as captured by a Lieb-Robinson bound. This feature makes them particularly suited for studying local dynamical magic resource generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that under random evolution, operator magic typically reaches near-maximal value for all R\'enyi indices, and we evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we solve the operator stabilizer entropy for interacting integrable XXZ circuit, finding that it quickly saturates to a constant value. Overall, this measure sheds light on the structural properties of many-body non-stabilizerness generation and can inspire Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+16 ...</summary><p>5+16 Pages, 2 figures. v4: fixed mistake in Appendix</p></details> |

In this work, we present a scalable approach based on semi-definite programming to derive certified bounds on the expectation value of an arbitrary observable in the steady state of Lindbladian dynamics. We illustrate our method on a series of many-body systems, including paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains and two-dimensional ladders, considering both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady-states. We benchmark our method with state-of-the-art tensor-network approaches that, unlike our method, are only able to provide estimates, with no guarantee, on steady-state quantities. For the tested models, only modest computational effort is needed to obtain certified non-trivial bounds for system sizes intractable by exact methods. Our method introduces the first general numerical tool for bounding steady-state properties of open quantum dynamics, opening a new avenue in the understanding of stable configurations in many-body systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>See a...</summary><p>See also arXiv:2410.07384</p></details> |
| **[Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of generalized Hubbard models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10314v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison to quantum and classical Ising machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16431v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16+7 ...</summary><p>16+7 pages, 12+7 figures; close to published version</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Simulation of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics with Or-Represented Quantum Algebra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13241v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance numerical methods are essential not only for advancing quantum many-body physics but also for enabling integration with emerging quantum computing platforms. We present a scalable and general-purpose parallel algorithm for quantum simulations based on or-represented quantum algebra (ORQA). This framework applies to arbitrary spin systems and naturally integrates with quantum circuit simulation in the Heisenberg picture, particularly relevant to recent large-scale experiments on superconducting qubit processors [Kim et al., Nature 618, 500 (2023)]. As a benchmark, we simulate the kicked Ising model on a 127-qubit heavy-hexagon lattice, tracking the time evolution of local magnetization using up to one trillion Pauli strings. Executed on the supercomputer Fugaku, our simulations exhibit strong scaling up to $2^{17}$ parallel processes with near-linear communication overhead. These results establish ORQA as a practical and high-performance tool for quantum many-body dynamics, and highlight its potential for integration into hybrid quantum-classical computational frameworks, complementing recent advances in tensor-network and surrogate simulation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body systems in continuous space addressed by a tensor network approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23624v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schr\"odinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling behaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide strong numerical evidence supporting the efficiency of TN in representing continuous-space quantum wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit and offer an efficient approach to studying entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

These methods provide an exact equation which returns the optimal solution of the problems. As in other tensor network algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, the method is based on imaginary time evolution and the implementation of restrictions in the tensor network. In addition, we introduce the use of symmetries and the reutilization of intermediate calculations, reducing the computational complexity for both problems. To show the efficiency of our implementations, we carry out some performance experiments and compare the results with those obtained by other classical algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, extended version of the presented and published at the 1st International Conference on Quantum Software (IQSOFT)</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Fisher information from tensor network integration of Lyapunov equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11330v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a geometric measure of state deformation calculated along the trajectory parameterizing an ensemble of quantum states. It serves as a key concept in quantum metrology, where it is linked to the fundamental limit on the precision of the parameter that we estimate. However, the QFI is notoriously difficult to calculate due to its non-linear mathematical form. For mixed states, standard numerical procedures based on eigendecomposition quickly become impractical with increasing system size. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel numerical approach based on Lyapunov integrals that combines the concept of symmetric logarithmic derivative and tensor networks. Importantly, this approach requires only the elementary matrix product states algorithm for time-evolution, opening a perspective for broad usage and application to many-body systems. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our methodology through an illustrative example in quantum metrology, where the thermal state of the transverse-field Ising model is used to measure magnetic field amplitude.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the quantum Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism near the quantum critical point. Using the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS), we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02127v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</p></details> |  |

The optimization is driven by solving the Hartree-Fock equations (HF) with the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm on Cartesian grids that are iteratively refined. In contrast to the standard way of tackling the mean-field problem by expressing the molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) our method only requires as much basis functions as there are electrons within the system. Benchmark calculations for atoms and molecules with up to ten electrons show excellent agreement with LCAO calculations with large basis sets supporting the validity of the tensor network approach. Our work therefore offers a promising alternative to well-established HF-solvers and could pave the way to define highly accurate, fully numerical, molecule-adaptive basis sets, which, in the future, could lead to benefits for post-HF calculations.</p></details> | 27 pages, 16 figures |

The average density of these defects scales with the quench rate, adhering to a universal power law as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we aim to investigate the counting statistics of kink density in the 1D transverse-field quantum Ising model. We demonstrate on multiple quantum processing units up to 100 qubits, that higher-order cumulants follow a universal power law scaling as a function of the quench time. We also show the breakdown of the KZM for short quenches for finite-size systems. Tensor network simulations corroborate our quantum simulation results for bigger systems not in the asymptotic limit.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider ``All boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages self-contained summary + 100 pages main text + appendices</p></details> |
| **[Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08329v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages main text + 7 pages Appendix and References; 7 + 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Overcoming the entanglement barrier with sampled tensor networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09714v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of entanglement under unitary time evolution is the primary bottleneck for modern tensor-network techniques--such as Matrix Product States (MPS)--when computing time-dependent expectation values. This {entanglement barrier} restricts classical simulations and, conversely, underpins the quantum advantage anticipated from future devices. Here we show that, for one-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the spatio-temporal tensor network encoding the evolved wave function amplitudes can be contracted efficiently along the left-right (spatial) direction. Exploiting this structure, we develop a hybrid Tensor-Network/Monte-Carlo (TN-MC) algorithm that samples the wave function and evaluates expectation values of generic local operators with computational cost that scales only polynomially in time. The accurate contraction of the wave function amplitudes is a consequence of the favorable scaling with time of the generalised temporal entropies. We find that their real part either saturates or, at most, grows logarithmically with time, revealing new instances of continuous dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) which we characterize. Our results therefore show that, when computing expectation values of local operators, the entanglement barrier in one-dimensional Hamiltonian evolution can be bypassed with a TN-MC blend.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures. v2: extended discussion and improved presentation</p></details> |

By encoding bulk information into highly entangled boundary degrees of freedom, they capture key features of holography such as subregion duality, operator reconstruction, and complementary recovery. Among them, hyperinvariant tensor networks-characterized by the inclusion of edge tensors and the enforcement of multi-tensor isometries-offer a promising platform for realizing features such as state dependence and nontrivial boundary correlations. However, existing constructions are largely confined to two-dimensional regular tilings, and the structural principles underlying hyperinvariance remain poorly understood, especially in higher dimensions. To address this, we introduce a geometric criterion called angular k-uniformity, which refines standard k-uniformity and its planar variants by requiring isometric behavior within angular sectors of a tensor's rotationally symmetric layout. This condition enables the systematic identification and construction of hyperinvariant holographic codes on regular hyperbolic honeycombs in arbitrary dimension, and extends naturally to heterogeneous networks and qLEGO architectures beyond regular tilings. Altogether, angular k-uniformity provides a versatile, geometry-aware framework for analyzing and designing holographic tensor networks and codes with hyperinvariant features such as nontrivial boundary correlations and state-dependent complementary recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 32 pages, 11 figures.

We present equal-time spin structure factors which further characterize the nature of the presumed quantum spin liquid.

These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages + appendices, 20 figures</p></details> |

In this work we study the Mott insulating phases of the SU(3) Hubbard model at 1/3-filling using infinite projected entangled-pair states, optimized with both imaginary time evolution and variational optimization. In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement R\'enyi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Remarkably, it was also recently realized that shielded polar molecules exhibit an SU(N) symmetry among their hyperfine states, opening the door to SU(N) systems with larger N, bosonic particle statistics, and tunable interactions -- both repulsive and attractive. Motivated by these results, we have studied the SU(3) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on a square lattice. Using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method, we explore the finite-temperature phase diagram and provide evidence for three distinct regions -- a three-component Fermi liquid (FL) region, a "trion" liquid (TL) region, and an ordered Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW phase is stable at finite temperature (in contrast to the SU(2) CDW), while the FL to TL crossover appears to point to a quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Our method extends straightforwardly to larger N and is sign-problem free for even values of N. With these results, we demonstrate the potential physics enabled by using polar molecules as a quantum simulation platform for the attractive SU(N) FHM.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 pages of supplemental material (with 3 supplemental figures)</p></details> |
| **[A Time-Symmetric Quantum Algorithm for Direct Eigenstate Determination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10283v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time symmetry in quantum mechanics, where the current quantum state is determined jointly by both the past and the future, offers a more comprehensive description of physical phenomena. This symmetry facilitates both forward and backward time evolution, providing a computational advantage over methods that rely on a fixed time direction. In this work, we present a nonvariational and \textit{time-symmetric quantum algorithm} for addressing the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian, leveraging the coherence between forward and backward time evolution. Our approach enables the simultaneous determination of both the ground state and the highest excited state, as well as the direct identification of arbitrary eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Unlike existing methods, our algorithm eliminates the need for prior computation of lower eigenstates, allowing for the direct extraction of any eigenstate and energy bandwidth while avoiding error accumulation. Its non-variational nature ensures convergence to target states without encountering the barren plateau problem. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the non-unitary evolution using both the linear combination of unitaries and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Our algorithm is applied to compute the energy bandwidth and spectrum of various molecular systems, as well as to identify topological states in condensed matter systems, including the Kane-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We anticipate that this algorithm will provide an efficient solution for eigenvalue problems, particularly in distinguishing quantum phases and calculating energy bands.</p></details> |  |

Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages,2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2212.01823; text overlap with arXiv:2004.10565, arXiv:2202.00542</p></details> |

| **[Accelerating ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations by delayed update and block force-bias update](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09611v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) methods have become key numerical tools for studying quantum phases and phase transitions in interacting many-fermion systems. Despite the broad applicability, the efficiency of these algorithms is often limited by the bottleneck associated with the {\it local update} of the field configuration. In this work, we propose two novel update schemes, the {\it delayed update} and {\it block force-bias update}, both of which can generally and efficiently accelerate ground-state AFQMC simulations. The {\it delayed update}, with a predetermined delay rank, is an elegantly improved version of the {\it local update}, accelerating the process by replacing multiple vector-vector outer products in the latter with a single matrix-matrix multiplication. The {\it block force-bias update} is a block variant of the conventional force-bias update, which is a highly efficient scheme for dilute systems but suffers from the low acceptance ratio in lattice models. Our modified scheme maintains the high efficiency while offering flexible tuning of the acceptance ratio, controlled by the block size, for any desired fermion filling. We apply these two update schemes to both the standard and spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional Hubbard models, demonstrating their speedup over the {\it local update} with respect to the delay rank and block size. We also explore their efficiencies across varying system sizes and model parameters. Our results identify a speedup of $\sim$$8$ for systems with $\sim$$1600$ lattice sites. Furthermore, we have investigated the broader applications as well as an application diagram of these update schemes to general correlated fermion systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

These systems serve as quantum simulators for bipartite lattices with broken sublattice symmetry, providing a platform to study the extended Hubbard model's emergent magnetic phenomena, including Lieb's magnetism at half-filling, edge depolarization upon single-electron addition, and Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Our non-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations, performed for lattices of up to 61 sites, reveal that TGQDs transition from metallic to insulating regimes as a function of site radius size, while retaining edge-polarized ground states at half-filling. Notably, edge depolarization occurs upon single-electron doping in both metallic and insulating phases, contrasting with the Nagaoka ferromagnetism observed in hexagonal armchair geometries.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Using non-perturbative dynamic cluster approximation quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we characterize the magnetic and superconducting pairing behavior of a realistic bilayer two-orbital Hubbard-Hund model of this system that describes the relevant Ni $e_g$ states with physically relevant interaction strengths. We find a leading $s^\pm$ superconducting instability in this model and show that this state primarily arises from interlayer pairing in the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital that is driven by strong interlayer spin-fluctuations in that orbital. These results provide non-perturbative evidence supporting the picture that a simple single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model for the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital provides an excellent low-energy effective description of the superconducting behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we first investigated the average sign problem in the breathing kagome lattice, which is significantly affected by both the breathing strength and the interaction strength. Secondly, we calculated the electronic kinetic energy, the direct current conductivity, and the electronic density of states at the Fermi level to determine the critical interaction strength for the metal-insulator transition. Our results indicate that the breathing effect, in conjunction with the interaction strength, drives the kagome system from a metal to an insulator. Finally, we evaluated the magnetic properties and constructed a phase diagram incorporating both transport and magnetic properties. The phase diagram reveals that as the interaction strength increases, the system transitions from a paramagnetic metal to a Mott insulator. Our research provides a theoretical guidance for utilizing the breathing effect to control the band gaps, conductivity, and magnetic properties of kagome materials with electronic interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages and 7 Figures</p></details> |

In this work, we present a neural-network-based variational quantum Monte Carlo approach for ab-initio absorption spectra. We leverage parallel batch autoregressive sampling and GPU-supported local energy parallelism to efficiently compute ground states of complex systems. By integrating neural quantum ground states with the kernel polynomial method, our approach accurately calculates absorption spectra for large molecules with over 50 electrons, achieving FCI-level precision. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior scalability and reduced runtime compared to FCI, marking a significant step forward in optical property calculations for large-scale quantum systems.</p></details> |  |

Gilardoni {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, L161106 (2022)] to distinguish trivial, weak-, and strong-topological insulators in three dimensions, in presence of the inversion symmetry. The marker is written in term of ground-state expectation values of position operators and can be employed to detect topological phases of interacting systems beyond mean-field approximations, e.g., within quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Here, we show that the correct results of the non-interacting limit are reproduced by the many-body marker.</p></details> | 8 pages and 1 figure |
| **[Absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00126v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures; minor changes to V1</p></details> |

However, the update process in DQMC is often a bottleneck for its efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a generalized delay update scheme that can handle both onsite and extended interactions. Our delay update scheme can be implemented in both zero-temperature and finite-temperature versions of DQMC. We apply the delay update scheme to various strongly correlated electron models and evaluate its efficiency under different conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed delay update scheme significantly improves the efficiency of DQMC simulations, enable it to simulate larger system size.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Multiparty Entanglement Microscopy of Quantum Ising models in 1d, 2d and 3d](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12533v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entanglement microscopy reveals the true quantum correlations among the microscopic building blocks of many-body systems [Nat. Commun. 16, 96 (2025)]. Using this approach, we study the multipartite entanglement of the quantum Ising model in 1d, 2d, and 3d. We first obtain the full reduced density matrix (tomography) of subregions that have at most 4 sites via quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and the exact solution in 1d. We then analyze both bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) among the sites in the subregion. To do so, we use a variety of measures including the negativity, as well as a true measure of GME: the genuinely multipartite concurrence (or GME concurrence), and its computationally cheaper lower bound, $I_2$. We provide a complete proof that $I_2$ bounds the GME concurrence, and show how the symmetries of the state simplify its evaluation. For adjacent sites, we find 3- and 4-spin GME present across large portions of the phase diagram, reaching maximum near the quantum critical point. In 1d, we identify the singular scaling of the derivative $dI_2/dh$ approaching the critical point. We observe a sharp decrease of GME with increasing dimensionality, coherent with the monogamous nature of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that GME disappears for subregions consisting of non-adjacent sites in both 2d and 3d, offering a stark illustration of the short-ranged nature of entanglement in equilibrium quantum matter arXiv:2402.06677. Finally, we analyze the most collective form of entanglement by evaluating the GME concurrence among all spins in the lattice, which can be obtained from a simple observable: the single-site transverse magnetization. This global concurrence is larger in 1d compared to 2d/3d, but it is relatively less robust against perturbations such as local measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+8 ...</summary><p>12+8 pages, 7+7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic structure factor of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with long-range interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15168v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as a ``model selection'' tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</p></details> | 23 pages, 29 figures |

Through systematic analysis of one-dimensional model systems, we evaluate their computational efficiency and representational power against established methods. Our numerical experiments suggest some efficient training methods and we explore how the computational cost scales with desired precision, particle number, and system parameters. Roughly speaking, KANs seem to be 10 times cheaper computationally than other neural network based ansatz. We also introduce a novel approach for handling strong short-range potentials-a persistent challenge for many numerical techniques-which generalizes efficiently to higher-dimensional, physically relevant systems with short-ranged strong potentials common in atomic and nuclear physics.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

By employing the numerically exact determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we mimic the effects of experimental Ca vacancy by an external local potential to investigate the charge and spectral properties of the system hosting two doped holes. The model numerically support the role of the $4\times4$ supercell as the building block of hole doped cuprates via the hole density distribution and local spectra around the local potential.

| **[Variation of Bose surface by Filling in Cooper pair Bose metal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24405v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) is a non-superfluid quantum phase in which uncondensed fermion pairs form a "Bose surface" in momentum space. We investigate the CPBM in the two-dimensional spin-anisotropic attractive Hubbard model by tuning the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping t', carrier filling n, and spin anisotropy alpha, using large-scale constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations. A moderate NNN hopping (t'/t = 0.2) substantially enlarges the CPBM region: the phase extends into weaker anisotropy regimes and coexists with a commensurate charge-density wave (CDW) near half-filling (n > 0.95), where CDW order would otherwise dominate at t' = 0. Interestingly, t' suppresses the overall CDW peak amplitude and introduces a geometric correlation between the orientations of the Fermi and Bose surfaces: for weak Fermi-surface rotations, the Bose surface remains aligned with the lattice axes, while larger distortions drive both surfaces to rotate in tandem. Momentum-resolved pairing distributions reveal that the bosonic pairing channels are jointly controlled by t' and carrier filling n. For small t', d_xy-wave correlations dominate across the entire filling range. In contrast, for larger t', the dominant pairing symmetry varies with n, reflecting a nontrivial interplay between frustration and density. These findings establish carrier filling and NNN hopping as complementary levers for manipulating CPBM stability and provide concrete criteria for identifying non-superfluid bosonic matter in cold-atom and correlated-electron systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures, |

In systems of linear size $L=8$ with Hilbert space dimension $3.1\times 10^8$, GCNN shows fidelity as high as $0.99999$ with ED. For $12\leq L\leq 32$, we find excellent agreement with QMC estimates of energy, order parameters and correlation functions. The network is optimized by minimizing the energy estimated from a Metropolis algorithm assisted by a directed loop sampler. We analyze the quantum geometric tensor at the minima for $\mathcal{L}=1,2$ and $3$ and show that the empirical quantum dimension saturates with increasing network complexity due to Metropolis sampling constraints.</p></details> |  |

| **[Interfacial superconductivity and a Se-vacancy ordered insulating phase in the FeSe/PbOx heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13857v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in FeSe/SrTiO3 has sparked significant interests in exploring new superconducting systems with engineered interfaces. Here, using molecular beam epitaxy growth, we successfully fabricate FeSe/PbOx heterostructures and discover superconductivities in three different monolayer FeSe-related interfaces. We observe superconducting gaps of 13~14 meV in the monolayer FeSe films grown on two different phases of PbOx. Moreover, we discover a new insulating Fe10Se9 phase with an ordered $\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}$ Se-vacancy structure. Our first-principles calculation suggests that this new insulating phase originates from electronic correlation. Intriguingly, an additional monolayer FeSe film grown on the insulating Fe10Se9 also exhibits superconductivity with the gap size of 5 meV. Our results suggest that the work function differences between the monolayer FeSe and the substrates, which can induce band bending and charge transfer, are crucial for the interfacial superconductivity.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Altermagnetism and superconductivity in a multiorbital t-J model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17050v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by exploring doped multi-orbital antiferromagnets (AFMs) and altermagnets (ALMs) we explore minimal $t$-$J$ models on the square-octagon lattice which favor such collinear magnetic orders in the regime where spin exchange dominates. While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Interfacial superconductivity in the type-III heterostructure SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13690v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interfacial superconductivity (IS) has been a topic of intense interest in the condensed matter physics, due to its unique properties and exotic photoelectrical performance. However, there are few reports about IS systems consisting of two insulators. Here, motivated by the emergence of an insulator-metal transition in the type-III heterostructure and the superconductivity in the some "special" two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors via the electron doping, we predict that 2D heterostructure SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$ is a model system for realizing the IS by using first-principles calculations. Our results show that due to the slight but crucial interlayer charge transfer, SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$ turns to be a type-III heterostructure with metallic properties and shows a superconducting transition with the critical temperature ($T_\text{c}$) of 3.73 K. Similar to the enhance electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in the electron doped SnSe$_2$ monolayer, the IS in the heterostructure SnSe$_2$/PtTe$_2$ mainly originates from the metallized SnSe$_2$ layer. Furthermore, we find that the superconductivity is sensitive to the tensile lattice strain, forming a dome-shaped superconducting phase diagram. Remarkably, at the 7\% tensile strain, the superconducting $T_\text{c}$ can increase more than twofold (8.80 K), resulting from the softened acoustic phonon at the M point and the enhanced EPC strength. Our study provides a concrete example for realizing IS in the type-III heterosturcture, which waits for future experimental verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13612v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In conventional, phonon-mediated superconductors, the transition temperature $T_c$ and normal-state scattering rate $1/\tau$ - deduced from the linear-in-temperature resistivity $\rho(T)$ - are linked through the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda_{\rm ph}$. In cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, no equivalent $\lambda$ has yet been identified, despite the fact that at high doping, $\alpha$ - the low-$T$ $T$-linear coefficient of $\rho(T)$ - also scales with $T_c$. Here, we use dc resistivity and high-field magnetoresistance to extract $\tau^{-1}$ in electron-doped La$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (LCCO) as a function of $x$ from optimal doping to beyond the superconducting dome. A highly anisotropic inelastic component to $\tau^{-1}$ is revealed whose magnitude diminishes markedly across the doping series. Using known Fermi surface parameters and subsequent modelling of the Hall coefficient, we demonstrate that the form of $\tau^{-1}$ in LCCO is consistent with scattering off commensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations of variable strength $\lambda_{\rm sf}$. The clear correlation between $\alpha$, $\lambda_{\rm sf}$ and $T_c$ then identifies low-energy spin-fluctuations as the primary pairing glue in electron-doped cuprates. The contrasting magnetotransport behaviour in hole-doped cuprates suggests that the higher $T_c$ in the latter cannot be attributed solely to an increase in $\lambda_{\rm sf}$. Indeed, the success in modelling LCCO serves to reinforces the notion that resolving the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped cuprates may require more than a simple extension of BCS theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main article (5 figures) plus Methods (10 figures); 28 pages in total</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting and spin-density wave phases probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the organic conductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11709v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have probed the local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) of the Bechgaard salt organic superconductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$ in slowly cooled single crystals cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In well STM imaged crystallographic surface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at temperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or insulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting state is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of disorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular state is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape profile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy scale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the existence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low energy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum criticality of the material. At higher energy disorder combined to correlations deplete further the DOS. By contrast a non-linear U-shape characterizes the local low energy DOS profile for the more disordered and insulating surface areas of the spin-density wave state. The experimental results are compared quantitatively with those predicted by the renormalization group theory of the quasi-one dimensional electron gas model and its description of the superconducting and spin-density wave states that are interlinked by quantum criticality in the Bechgaard salts.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Tunable superconducting diode effect in higher-harmonic InSb nanosheet interferometers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13391v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting diodes, characterized by the nonreciprocal supercurrent flow, have gained significant attention for their potential in dissipationless electronics. This study presents a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) composed of two Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions. Utilizing prepatterned local backgates, we achieve a gate- and flux-tunable superconducting diode with controllable efficiency in both amplitude and sign. Numerical simulations attribute the diode effect to higher harmonics in the current-phase relation. Crucially, fractional Shapiro step experiments provide direct insights into the evolution of these higher harmonics with flux tuning, showcasing significant enhancements in the second-harmonic signatures of the SQUID near half-integer flux quanta. Furthermore, we investigate the microwave-assisted diode response and experimentally show that the polarity of the diode effect can be switched by the microwave power. These results demonstrate the potential of InSb nanosheet-based hybrid devices as highly tunable elements for use in dissipationless electronics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical study of the crystal structure of the bilayer nickel oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and analysis of possible unconventional superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06935v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[The hybrid Josephson rhombus: A superconducting element with tailored current-phase relation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20082v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling the current-phase relation (CPR) of Josephson elements is essential for tailoring the eigenstates of superconducting qubits, tuning the properties of parametric amplifiers, and designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices. Here, we introduce the hybrid Josephson rhombus, a highly tunable superconducting circuit containing four semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson junctions embedded in a loop. Combining magnetic frustration with gate-voltage-controlled tuning of individual Josephson couplings provides deterministic control of the harmonic content of the rhombus CPR. We show that for balanced Josephson couplings at full frustration, the hybrid rhombus displays a $\pi$-periodic $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential, indicating coherent charge-$4e$ transport. Tuning away from the balanced configuration, we observe a superconducting diode effect with efficiency exceeding 25%. These results showcase the potential of hybrid Josephson rhombi as fundamental building blocks for noise-resilient qubits and quantum devices with custom transport properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Abnormal Normal State and Pressure-driven Reentrant Superconductivity in the Heavy $d$-electron Superconductor Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12416v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity beyond the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) framework often emerges out of a normal state that is accompanied by exotic magnetism and thereby displays many exceptional transport and thermodynamic properties. Here we report that the normal state of the heavy $d$-electron superconductor Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ is characterized by a weak \textit{ferromagnetism} that persists up to room temperature. We show that the broad hump in its resistivity likely results from the Kondo interaction of the conduction electrons with this novel magnetism. By applying pressure, superconductivity is fully suppressed first. In the high-pressure regime, however, we observe a second dome of superconductivity with its maximum $T_c$ greater than the ambient pressure value, highlighting the possible \textit{unconventional} superconductivity in this heavy $d$-electron sulfide.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Superconducting phase diagram of finite-layer nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12144v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following the successful prediction of the superconducting phase diagram for infinite-layer nickelates, here we calculate the superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ vs. the number of layers $n$ for finite-layer nickelates using the dynamical vertex approximation. To this end, we start with density functional theory, and include local correlations non-perturbatively by dynamical mean-field theory for $n=2$ to 7. For all $n$, the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital crosses the Fermi level, but for $n>4$ there are additional $(\pi, \pi)$ pockets or tubes that slightly enhance the layer-averaged hole doping of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals beyond the leading $1/n$ contribution stemming from the valence electron count. We finally calculate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the single-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Hubbard model by dynamical vertex approximation.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + supplemental material</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting Diode Effects: Mechanisms, Materials and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11717v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting diode effects (SDEs) generally emerge in superconducting systems where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken, showing nonreciprocal current characteristics: nondissipative in one direction and ohmic in the opposite. Since the discovery of the SDEs by Ando et al. in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor [Nb/V/Ta]n in 2020, notable progress has been achieved on both the theoretical and experimental fronts. It has been proposed that intrinsic SDEs are closely linked to various exotic superconducting states, such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, topological superconductivity, and chiral superconductivity. Recently, SDEs have emerged as important experimental tools for detecting symmetry breaking in exotic superconducting states. This advancement not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental nature of SDEs but also opens new possibilities for their applications in superconducting physics and related fields. This review focuses on the recent experimental progress in the observation of the SDEs and discusses their primary mechanisms from the perspective of material properties and symmetry breaking. Finally, we summarize the observed rectification efficiency of SDE devices and discuss future research directions in this rapidly developing field.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, published to Adv.

| **[High-Temperature Superconductivity from Finite-Range Attractive Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11624v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter we consider $D$-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids, and demonstrate that an attractive interaction with a finite range $R_s$ that is much greater than the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F$ breaks the conventional BCS theory of superconductivity. In contrast to the BCS prediction of a finite superconducting gap for all attractive contact interactions, we show that a finite-range interaction does not induce a superconducting gap. Instead, the pair susceptibility develops a power-law singularity at zero momentum and zero frequency signaling quantum critical behavior without long-range ordering. Starting from this, we show that superconductivity can be stabilized by adding a short-range attractive interaction, which is always present in real electronic systems. As an example, we consider a layered quasi-two-dimensional material with attractive electron-electron interactions mediated by optical phonons. We demonstrate a dome shape of the critical temperature $T_c$ versus doping, strongly suppressed isotope effect, and a weak dependence of the optimal doping and maximal $T_c^* \sim 0.1 E_F$ on the interaction range at $R_s \gg \lambda_F$, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy. We believe that these results could be relevant to high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weak coupling approach to magnetic and orbital susceptibilities for superconducting states in multiorbital electron-phonon coupled model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11601v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alkali-doped fullerides are molecular-based superconductors with multiple active orbitals. In this paper, using the Eliashberg theory with the retardation effect of Jahn-Teller phonons, we study the response of the spin-singlet superconducting state relevant to fulleride materials. The spin Zeeman field is not active for the singlet pairing state, and the magnetic orbital field, which physically generates a circular electron motion inside the fullerene molecule, is also shown to be inactive. On the other hand, the electric orbital (or quadrupolar) field, which corresponds to a uniaxial distortion, remains active across the superconducting phase transition. This is understood by the orbital-symmetric structure of the Cooper pair, which is susceptible to the electric orbital field, while it is not the case for the magnetic orbital field which tends to create an antisymmetric part.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719v4)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Organometallic-Inorganic Hybrid MXenes with Tunable Superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11035v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ti-based two-dimensional transition-metal carbides (MXenes) have attracted attention due to their superior properties and are being explored across various applications1,2. Despite their versatile properties, superconductivity has never been demonstrated, not even predicted, for this important group of 2D materials. In this work, we have introduced an electrochemical intercalation protocol to construct versatile organometallic-inorganic hybrid MXenes and achieved tunable superconductivity in the metallocene-modified layered crystals. Through structural editing of MXene matrix at atomic scale and meticulously modulated intercalation route, Ti3C2Tx intercalated with metallocene species exhibits a superconductive transition temperature (Tc) of 10.2 K. Guest intercalation induced electron filling and strain engineering are responsible for the emerging superconductivity in this intrinsically non-superconducting material. Theoretically, simulated electron-phonon interaction effects further elucidate the nature of the changes in Tc. Furthermore, the Tc of crafted artificial superlattices beyond Ti-based MXenes have been predicted, offering a general strategy for engineering superconductivity and magnetism in layered hybrid materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in superconducting hybrid systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10911v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the effects of interfacial spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) on superconductors, focusing on its impact on electronic transport and spin-charge conversion. Using a symmetry-based nonlinear sigma model, we derive effective boundary conditions for the Usadel and Maxwell equations that account for spin-galvanic effect, spin relaxation, and spin precession. This approach allows for the analysis of various interfaces without relying on specific microscopic models. We apply these boundary conditions to derive ISOC-induced terms in the Ginzburg-Landau functional, which is then used to compute the critical temperature of superconducting films with ISOC subjected to an external magnetic field. Our findings show that, contrary to a recent prediction, the critical temperature of a film cannot be enhanced by an external magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrate that the combination of ISOC and an external magnetic field leads to a superconducting diode effect. Its efficiency strongly depends on the interplay between the spin-galvanic and the spin relaxation terms. Our results provide a framework for understanding ISOC in superconducting systems and highlight the potential for optimizing diode efficiency through careful interface engineering</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we use a superconducting qubit array to emulate a tight-binding model on the rhombic lattice, which features flat bands. Enabled by broad adjustability of the dispersion of the energy bands and of on-site disorder, we examine regimes where flat-band localization and Anderson localization compete. We observe disorder-induced localization for dispersive bands and disorder-induced delocalization for flat bands. Remarkably, we find a sudden transition between the two regimes and, in its vicinity, the semblance of quantum critical scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, and Supplementary Information</p></details> |
| **[Spin Liquid and Superconductivity emerging from Steady States and Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07125v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that, starting with a simple fermion wave function, the steady mixed state of the evolution of a class of Lindbladians, and the ensemble created by strong local measurement of fermion density without post-selection can be mapped to the "Gutzwiller projected" wave functions in the doubled Hilbert space -- the representation of the density matrix through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. A Gutzwiller projection is a broadly used approach of constructing spin liquid states. For example, if one starts with a gapless free Dirac fermion pure quantum state, the constructed mixed state corresponds to an algebraic spin liquid in the doubled Hilbert space. We also predict that for some initial fermion wave function, the mixed state created following the procedure described above is expected to have a spontaneous "strong-to-weak" U(1) symmetry breaking, which corresponds to the emergence of superconductivity in the doubled Hilbert space. We also design the experimental protocol to construct the desired physics of mixed states.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, more results and new authors added</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Topological Superconductivity via Berry Curvature Effects in Spectral Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02165v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experimental efforts on topological superconductivity (TSC) have primarily focused on the detection of Majorana boundary modes, while the bulk properties of TSC - particularly in two dimensions (2D) - remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we theoretically propose a distinctive signature in the spectral function away from the boundaries, capable of detecting 2D chiral p-wave TSC induced in a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) heterostructure. This signature can be probed experimentally through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy or momentum- and energy-resolved tunneling spectroscopy under a weak magnetic field B. We show that within the topological phase, the spectral intensity of the lowest superconducting band at small momenta k~0 brightens (darkens) linearly with increasing B, whereas it darkens (brightens) in the trivial phase when the Rashba system is electron- (hole-) doped. This sharp contrast arises from the phase-space Berry curvature (BC) of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, a novel quantum geometric property that generalizes the conventional momentum-space BC. The effect of this phase-space BC can also be detected by the differential conductance away from the boundaries. Our falsifiable prediction provides an experimental avenue for detecting Rashba-induced chiral p-wave TSC without relying on Majorana mode detection, addressing a key challenge in the realization of 2D TSC.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Cosmic muon flux attenuation methods for superconducting qubit experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04938v5)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and demonstrate two practical mitigation methods to attenuate the cosmic muon flux, compatible with experiments involving superconducting qubits: shallow underground sites and specific device orientation. Using a specifically-built cosmic muon detector, we identify underground sites, widely present in urban environments, where significant attenuation of cosmic muon flux, up to a factor 35 for 100-meter depths, can be attained. Furthermore, we employ two germanium wafers in an above-ground laboratory, each equipped with a particle sensor, to show how the orientation of the chip with respect to the sky affects the amount and type of energy deposited on the substrate by ionizing radiation. We observe that the horizontal detector sees more counts at lower energy, while the vertical one is impacted by more particles at higher energy. The methods here described proposed ways to directly understand and reduce the effects of cosmic rays on qubits by attenuating the source of this type of decoherence, complementing existing on-chip mitigation strategies. We expect that both on-chip and off-chip methods combined will become ubiquitous in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubit circuits.</p></details> |  |

While submatrix updates were originally developed for Hirsch-Fye QMC with onsite interactions at finite temperatures [Phys. Rev. B 80, 195111 (2009)], their comprehensive application in DQMC has remained unexplored despite noted algorithmic similarities. We present the first comprehensive application of submatrix updates in DQMC, significantly extending beyond the original scope by enabling simulations with extended interactions and at zero temperature. Building upon conventional fast updates and delay updates, our generalized implementation achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, enabling simulations of the half-filled Hubbard model on lattices up to 8,000 sites - a scale previously challenging with standard DQMC implementations. This enhanced computational capability allows us to accurately determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Canted magnetism and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization in metallic states of the Lieb lattice Hubbard model near quarter filling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12235v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent experiment has examined ultracold, fermionic, spin-1/2 $^6$Li atoms in the Lieb lattice at different Hubbard repulsion $U$ and filling fractions $\nu$ (Lebrat et al. arXiv:2404.17555). At $\nu=1/2$ and small $U$, they observe an enhanced compressibility on the $p_{x,y}$ sites, pointing to a flat band near the Fermi energy. At $\nu=1/2$ and large $U$ they observe an insulating ferrimagnet. Both small and large $U$ observations at $\nu=1/2$ are consistent with theoretical expectations. Surprisingly, near $\nu=1/4$ and large $U$, they again observe a large $p_{x,y}$ compressibility, pointing to a flat $p_{x,y}$ band of fermions across the Fermi energy. Our Hartree-Fock computations near $\nu=1/4$ find states with canted magnetism (and related spiral states) at large $U$, which possess nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ bands near the Fermi level. We employ parton theories to describe quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order found in Hartree-Fock. We find a metallic state with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization possessing gapless, fermionic, spinless `chargons' carrying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges which have a nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ band near their Fermi level: this fractionalized metal is also consistent with observations. Our DMRG study does not indicate the presence of magnetic order, and so supports a fractionalized ground state. Given the conventional ferrimagnetic insulator at $\nu=1/2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalized metal at $\nu=1/4$ represents a remarkable realization of doping-induced fractionalization.</p></details> |  |

Oxygen vacancies, particularly in positively charged states, are suggested to profoundly impact the polymorphism kinetics and phase stability of hafnia, thereby affecting its ferroelectric behavior. The electronic structures of pristine and oxygen-deficient hafnia polymorph have been extensively studied using density functional theory, primarily employing (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals. However, these methods often underestimate band gaps and may not accurately capture the localized nature of $d$-electrons. In this work, we investigate hafnia in various phases using DFT + $U$ + $V$, with onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently via the pseudohybrid Hubbard density functional, ACBN0, and its extended version eACBN0. We find that the self-consistent DFT + $U$ method provides comparable accuracy to the computationally more expensive Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional in predicting relative thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and density of states. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective approach for estimating the formation energies of oxygen vacancies. Additionally, we demonstrate that environmentally dependent Hubbard parameters serve as useful indicators for analyzing bond strengths and electronic structures in real space.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we apply several many-body theories in the three-dimensional attractive Hubbard model. Specifically, we compare the results of various GW methods with DQMC simulations and observe that they provide reliable results in the weak to intermediate coupling regime. The critical exponents also agree well with the accurate results obtained from the 3D XY model. In the superconducting phase, the post-GW method significantly improves the description of Green's functions and density of states. Additionally, we propose a method to determine the temperature at which the pseudogap appears.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

Here, the fermionic part is constructed by a pair-product state, which explicitly depends on the phonon configuration, thus including the electron-phonon coupling in a backflow-inspired way. We report the results for the Hubbard model in presence of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger coupling to optical phonons, both at half-filling and upon hole doping. At half-filling, the ground state is either a translationally invariant Mott insulator, with gapless spin excitations, or a Peierls insulator, which breaks translations and has fully gapped excitations. Away from half-filling, the charge gap closes in both Mott and Peierls insulators, turning the former into a conventional Luttinger liquid (gapless in all excitation channels). The latter, instead, retains a finite spin gap that closes only above a threshold value of the doping. Even though consistent with the general theory of interacting electrons in one dimension, the existence of such a phase (with gapless charge but gapped spin excitations) has never been demonstrated in a model with repulsive interaction and with only two Fermi points. Since the spin-gapped metal represents the one-dimensional counterpart of a superconductor, our results furnish evidence that a true off-diagonal long-range order may exist in the two-dimensional case.</p></details> |  |

At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 4, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from self-consistent mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid (or stripe) states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U. We study the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid. The critical behavior serves as strong signatures of the critical theory and consequently of the existence of chiral spin liquid as the proximate phase.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses. We finally investigate the dissipative quench dynamics starting from a strongly-correlated superfluid state or from a Mott-insulating state; for the Bose-Hubbard chain initially confined in the superfluid-correlated regime, an unexpected strong decay of the density appearing at short times is revealed.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |

Here, by developing a hybrid potential that integrates a flat-top optical lattice with an optical box trap, we successfully realize the creation of three-dimensional, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases across approximately $8\times10^5$ lattice sites. This homogeneous system enables us to capture a well-defined energy band occupation that aligns perfectly with the theoretical calculations for a zero-temperature, ideal fermionic Hubbard model. Furthermore, by employing novel radio-frequency spectroscopy, we precisely measure the doublon fraction $D$ as a function of interaction strength $U$ and temperature $T$, respectively. The crossover from metal to Mott insulator is detected, where $D$ smoothly decreases with increasing $U$. More importantly, we observe a non-monotonic temperature dependence in $D$, revealing the Pomeranchuk effect and the development of extended antiferromagnetic correlations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directly imaging spin polarons in a kinetically frustrated Hubbard system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12951v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular lattice moir\'{e} materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (4 figures) + 8 pages methods (10 figures)</p></details> |

In this method, by introducing an auxiliary coupling space with extended local degree of freedom,the diagonal and off-diagonal disorders are treated in a unified and self-consistent framework of coherent potential approximation, within which the dynamical mean-field theory is naturally combined to handle the strongly correlated Anderson-Hubbard model. By using this approach, we compute matsubara Green's functions for a simple cubic lattice at finite temperatures and derive impurity spectral functions through the maximum entropy method. Our results reveal the critical influence of off-diagonal disorder on Mott-type metal-insulator transitions. Specifically, a reentrant phenomenon is identified, where the system transitions between insulating and metallic states under varying interaction strengths. The ACPA-DMFT method provides an efficient and robust computational method for exploring the intricate interplay of disorder and strong correlations.</p></details> |  |

The phenomenon was recently observed with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. Here, we explore the kinetic ferromagnetism within the square lattice Hubbard model and its strong-coupling counterpart, the $t-J$ model, at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit via numerical linked-cluster expansions. We find evidence of ferromagnetic Nagaoka polarons at dopings up to $\sim 30\%$ away from half filling for a variety of interaction strengths and at temperatures as low as $0.2$ of the hopping energy. We map out the boundaries of this phase through analyzing various correlation functions.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Observation of Magnon-Polarons in the Fermi-Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06757v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Programming optical-lattice Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05067v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fermionic atoms in optical lattices provide a native implementation of Fermi-Hubbard (FH) models that can be used as analog quantum simulators of many-body fermionic systems. Recent experimental advances include the time-dependent local control of chemical potentials and tunnelings, and thus enable to operate this platform digitally as a programmable quantum simulator. Here, we explore these opportunities and develop ground-state preparation algorithms for different fermionic models, based on the ability to implement both single-particle and many-body, high-fidelity fermionic gates, as provided by the native FH Hamiltonian. In particular, we first design variational, pre-compiled quantum circuits to prepare the ground state of the natively implemented FH model, with significant speedups relative to competing adiabatic protocols. Besides, the versatility of this variational approach enables to target extended FH models, i.e., including terms that are not natively realized on the platform. As an illustration, we include next-nearest-neighbor tunnelings at finite dopings, relevant in the context of $d$-wave superconductivity. Furthermore, we discuss how to approximate the imaginary-time evolution using variational fermionic circuits, both as an alternative state-preparation strategy, and as a subroutine for the Quantum Lanczos algorithm to further improve the energy estimation. We benchmark our protocols for ladder geometries, though they can be readily applied to 2D experimental setups to address regimes beyond the capabilities of current classical methods. These results pave the way for more efficient and comprehensive explorations of relevant many-body phases with existing programmable fermionic quantum simulators.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

Remarkably, the interaction induced bound state localization (BSL) can compete with non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and give rise to diverse density profiles. Via the quantum scattering methods in the center of mass frame, the system can be mapped to an effective two dimensional (2D) lattice with the two-particle interaction contributing to a defective line. For the bound states of the largest eigen-energy, in contrast to the Hermitian cases, where the maximal localization center is pinned around the center of lattice, NHSE can lead to a faded diagonal line localization. For the unbound scattering states, unlike the single corner localization in the 2D Hatano-Nelson model, interaction can force the total localization to split into multiple centers. To make the system topological nontrivial, we further include terms taking the form of two-photon tunneling and the non-Hermitian photon bound pairs are also observed, which demonstrates a competition among NHSE, BSL and edge localization. Finally, we propose the experimental simulations via the platforms of electrical circuits. Our works shed light on the crossover study of quantum optics and non-Hermitian many body physics.</p></details> |  |

Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide the first experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |

However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

| **[Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

The VMC results are in good agreement with the exact diagonalization (ED) calculation. For the single-hole case, the degenerate ground states are characterized by quantum numbers of a spin-1/2 and an orbital angular momentum $L_z=\pm 2$. The latter is associated with the emergent chiral spin/hole currents mutually surrounding the hole/spin-1/2 as a composite object or ``twisted hole''. A vanishing quasiparticle spectral weight is shown in the large-sample limit. In the two-hole ground state, the holes form a spin-singlet pairing with $d$+$id$ symmetry in the Cooper channel, but are of $s$-wave symmetry as a tightly bound pair of the ``twisted holes''. Such a pairing mechanism of dichotomy can be attributed to eliminating the local spin currents which has nothing to do with the long-range antiferromagnetic correlation. Superconducting ground state at finite doping is briefly discussed in terms of the tightly bound hole pairs as the building blocks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Previous experimental works have confirmed the existence of a tiny energy gap formed with Ni 3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Here we investigate the physical origin of this gap by analyzing symmetry properties of energy bands based on the group theory. The tiny gap comes from energy bands with opposite parity at the Brillouin zone center. In addition, we also find previously unknown Dirac points in some momentum directions around the Fermi level. An effective Hamiltonian is constructed to describe low energy physics of the tiny energy gap and Dirac points. Due to the low crystal symmetry of monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, its energy bands display strong anisotropic properties.</p></details> | 14 pages 5 figures |

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

It is believed that the density wave (DW) at ~150 K plays an important role in SC emergence, but its nature remains largely underexplored. Here, we utilized temperature-dependent in-situ Ni K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to probe the Ni-3d/4p electronic states of La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta samples down to 4.8 K, enabling us to witness the evolution of both in-plane d_(x^2-y^2)/p_x (p_y) and out-of-plane d_(3z^2-r^2)/p_z orbitals of NiO6 octahedron across the DW transition. Main edge energy associated with Ni 4p orbital shows an anomalous decline near DW transition, signifying the occurrence of lattice distortions as a hallmark of charge density wave. Below DW transition, the enlarged crystal field splitting (CFS) indicates an enhanced NiO6 octahedral distortion. Intriguingly, magnetic Pr substituents could activate the mutual interplay of d_(x^2-y^2) and d_(3z^2-r^2) orbitals. We discussed its relevance to the favored bulk SC in the pressurized polycrystalline La2PrNi2O7-delta than pristine.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and other multilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

We find significant hardening of optical Ni-O bond-stretching phonons when going from non-magnetic to paramagnetic state, and increasing Coulomb interaction will make them even harder. The electron correlation is found to be sensitive to the Ni-O bond-stretching distortions, indicating strong interplay between electron correlation and lattice. We find that the strong local electron correlation will not favor charge orders that couple to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons, in support of the recent experiment that a $3a_0$ charge order is absent in the infinite-layer nickelates. Our results emphasize that the effects of local magnetic fluctuations should be fully taken into account when describing the lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelates without long-range magnetic orders, and also provide evidence to ascribe the kink observed in the recent angle-resolved photoemission experiment to possible strong electron coupling to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Has b...</summary><p>Has been accepted for a publication in PRB</p></details> |

Here, we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistance, and Meissner effect in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with hydrostatic pressures up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase above 40 GPa. Zero resistance of the superconductivity was achieved with a maximum onset $T_c^{onset}$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed until it disappears above 80 GPa, resulting in a right-triangle-like superconducting region. The direct-current magnetic susceptibility technique successfully detected the Meissner effect in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure; the maximum superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be 62.7% at 22.0 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals under high pressure. The results reveal intimate connections among the superconductivity, oxygen content, and structure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a renewed version with Meissner effect measurements</p></details> |

To gain deeper insights into the distinct superconducting states, it is essential to unravel the nature of the density-wave states at ambient pressure, a topic that remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the direct visualization of an incommensurate unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in real space. The density of states (DOS) is strongly depleted near $E_F$, indicating the opening of a CDW gap of $2{\Delta} \approx 71$ meV, which is unfavorable for the formation of superconductivity at ambient pressure. We propose that the CDW arises from Fermi surface nesting, and is likely a subsidiary phase of a spin density wave. Compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the weaker electronic correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is likely one reason for the lower $T_c$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved-photo-emission-spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants and is insensitive to the c-axis one. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.1 p...</summary><p>4.1 pages, 5 figures with Appendix</p></details> |

Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and the potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector ${Q}\approx(0,\pm0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From the view of the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to ${Q}_0\approx\pm(0.58\pi,0.58\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by Fermi surfaces nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ much lower than that under high pressure. Further more, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC at AP.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The calculation details are improved and the format is modified</p></details> |

However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is $d_{xy}$, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged. Our work highlights the sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on low-energy electronic structure in multi-orbital superconductors, which calls for care in the downfolding procedure when one calculates their pairing symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

It is essential to search for high-temperature superconductivity in bulk samples and at ambient pressure in nickelates. In this study, we report influential factors that affect the appearance of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure. From direct-current magnetic measurements, we observe a clear diamagnetic response at 80 K in post-annealed single crystals of La3Ni2O7 in oxygen. The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be within 0.2%, resulting in a decrease in resistivity. This work presents a practical approach for further investigating high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | 4 figures, 11 pages |

Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Absence of superconductivity and density-wave transition in ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12647v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure stimulates intensive research interests. These nickelates crystallize in an orthogonal/monoclinic structure with tilted NiO$_6$ octahedra at ambient pressure and enter a density-wave-like phase at low temperatures. The application of pressure suppresses the octahedral tilting and triggers a transition to tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), which is believed to be a key prerequisite for the emergence of superconducting state. Here, by developing a high oxidative environment growth technology, we report the first tetragonal nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ microcrystals without octahedral tilting at ambient pressure. In tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, transport measurements find that both density-wave and superconducting transitions are absent up to 160 GPa, indicating a robust tetragonal metallic ground state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the band structure of ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ involves more $d_{z2}$ orbital contribution to the Fermi surface, compared to the monoclinic phase or the high-pressure superconducting tetragonal phase. The concurrent absence of density-wave state and high-pressure superconductivity in our ambient-pressure tetragonal crystals of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ suggests an underlying correlation between these two orders. It suggests that the tetragonal structure is not necessary, while the density-wave state is crucial for the superconductivity in nickelates. Our findings impose important constraints on the mechanism of pressure-induced superconductivity in nickelates and sheds new light on exploring ambient pressure high-temperature Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | submitted |

In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to the unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetic ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest the formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ simultaneously, thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario.

Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of heterointerfaces between 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and SrLaAlO$_4$ substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced oxygen 2p hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest pathways for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</p></details> | under review |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively.

The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p></details> |  |

Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript just accepted in Nature Communications.

The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</p></details> |  |

When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures (Published version)</p></details> |

In this work, we exploit the intense excitonic PL of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer combined with the high refractive index of bulk WS$_2$ to fabricate microdisk cavities with tunable light emission characteristics. These microdisks are created from a 50-nm-thick WS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure using frictional mechanical scanning probe lithography. The resulting cavities achieve a 4-10-fold enhancement in excitonic PL from the MoSe$_2$ monolayer at wavelengths near 800 nm. The excitonic PL peak is modulated by sharp spectral features, which correspond to whispering gallery modes (WGMs) supported by the cavity. A microdisk with a diameter of 2.35 $\mu$m demonstrates WGMs with a quality factor of up to 700, significantly surpassing theoretical predictions and suggesting strong potential for lasing applications. The spectral positions of the WGMs can be finely tuned by adjusting the microdisk's diameter and thickness, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. This approach offers a novel route for developing ultra-compact, all-TMDC double heterostructure light sources with record-small size.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures allow for tuning their electronic properties beyond their monolayer counterparts. We start by determining their electronic structure using density functional theory. We obtain the type-II band alignment and close in energy conduction band minima (valleys) at the $K$ and $Q$ points in the Brillouin zone. The valence band maxima, also energetically close, are located at the $K$ and $\Gamma$ points. By analyzing the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions, we describe the layer, spin, and orbital contributions. Next, we construct an \textit{ab initio}-based tight-binding model, which helps us to better understand the complexity of the interlayer interactions. We determine the effect of a vertical electric field, showing that vertical gating enables control of valleys extrema and their occupancy. Finally, we employ the tight-binding model to investigate laterally gated quantum dots and analyze the influence of a perpendicular electric field on their energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate that tuning the electric field enables control over the valley character of the quantum dot states, selectively localizing them in either the $K$ or $Q$ valleys, as evidenced by their characteristic degeneracies and wavefunctions.</p></details> |  |

In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporate the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir\'{e} unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferromagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Moreover, the hybridization of states from different layers and different valleys is allowed near the Fermi level. Those aspects are in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state.</p></details> |  |

Following earlier studies, this paper focuses on the hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer as a promising candidate for Li-decorated 2D materials. Our research reveals that lithium substitution on a selenium layer of MoSe2 can produce a hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer, which exhibits metallic behavior with potential phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.5 K. Additionally, by solving the anisotropic gap equations derived from Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we found that the Janus MoSeLi monolayer exhibits two-gap superconductivity. This finding underscores the potential of hexagonal Janus MoSeLi as a significant Li-decorated 2D material for exploring two-dimensional superconductivity and sets the stage for further investigations into new families of Janus transition-metal chalcogenides.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir\'e patterns of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H-stacking at a twist angle of 3.89$^{\circ}$ without spin-orbit coupling effect. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15$^{\circ}$. Multiple ultra-flat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7$^{\circ}$. The spin-orbit coupling leads to a giant spin splitting comparable to that observed in the untwisted system (about 0.45 eV) and is nearly independent of twisting and stacking. As a result, the K-valley flat band remains the valence band maximum with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Band unfolding reveals that the ultra-flat bands formed by the $\Gamma$ and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The $\Gamma$-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by structural reconstruction. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13$^{\circ}$) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</p></details> |  |

So far, it is assumed that the atomic reconstruction appearing in some of the heterostructures gives rise to a dominating localization of the exciton states. We demonstrate that excitonic states in reconstructed MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures can extend well beyond the moir\'e periodicity of the investigated heterostructures. The results are based on real-space calculations yielding a lateral potential map for interlayer excitons within the strain-relaxed heterostructures and corresponding real-space excitonic wavefunctions. We combine the theoretical results with cryogenic photoluminescence experiments, which support the computed level structure and relaxation characteristics of the interlayer excitons.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures based on transition-metal dichalcogenides have been extensively studied because of potential optoelectronic applications. We investigate the optical response of a light-emitting tunneling structure based on a WSe\textsubscript{2} monolayer as an active emission material using the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) experiments performed at low temperature of 5~K. We found that the application of the bias voltage allows us to change both a sign and a value of free carriers concentrations. Consequently, we address the several excitonic complexes emerging in PL spectra under applied bias voltage. The EL signal was also detected and ascribed to the emission in a high-carrier-concentration regime. The results show that the excitation mechanisms in the PL and EL are different, resulting in various emissions in both types of experimental techniques.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

The experimental findings reveal details of interlayer charge transfer on ultrafast timescales, showing that the spin-valley polarized state of photoexcited carriers is conserved during the charge transfer and formation of interlayer excitons. Our results confirm that phonon scattering mediates the interlayer charge transfer process, while a high phonon population at elevated temperatures causes a significant decrease in spin-valley selective charge transfer. Moreover, the experimental findings demonstrate the possibility that interlayer excitons and their spin-valley polarization can be probed in the optical response of intralayer excitons. These findings pave the way for ultrafast detection, control, and manipulation of spin-valley polarized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D heterostructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultrafast light-driven optical rotation and hidden orders in bulk WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06561v2)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-layer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, lacking point inversion symmetry, provide an efficient platform for valleytronics, where the electronic, magnetic, valley and lattice degrees of freedom can be selectively manipulated by using polarized light. This task is however thought to be limited in parent bulk compounds where the point inversion symmetry is restored. Exploiting the underlying quantum physics in bulk materials is thus one of the biggest paradigmatic challenges. Here we show that a sizable optical Kerr rotation can be efficiently generated in a wide energy range on ultrafast timescales in bulk WSe$_2$, by means of circularly-polarized light. We rationalize these findings as a result of the hidden spin/layer/valley quantum entanglement. The spectral analysis reveals clear features at the three characteristic frequencies corresponding to the A-, B- and C-exciton edges. The origin and the relative sign of all these features is shown to stem from the selective Pauli blocking of intralayer and interlayer optical transitions. The long lifetime of the broadband Kerr response ($\tau \sim 500$ fs) provides a strong indication that coupled photo-induced electron and hole densities survive in bulk compounds longer than previously expected. The present report demonstrates that a hidden quantum entanglement is operative also in bulk centrosymmetric layered materials, opening the way for an effective exploitation of bulk WSe$_2$ in optoelectronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+3 ...</summary><p>14+3 pages, 3+3 figures; fixed typo in the first author's name</p></details> |

It is found that the influence of structure relaxation on the amplitude of PES corrugations (determining static friction) depends on the unit cell size (or related twist angle) of the moir\'e system. For moir\'e systems with the smallest unit cells, the amplitudes of PES corrugations calculated with and without account of structure relaxation are approximately the same. However, for large unit cell sizes, the structure relaxation can lead to an increase of PES corrugations by orders of magnitude. This means that structure relaxation can provide the main contribution into the static friction of a superlubric system under certain conditions (such as the contact size and twist angle). Moreover, the change of the PES type because of structure relaxation from a trigonal lattice of maxima to a trigonal lattice of minima is observed for the systems with the moir\'e patterns (5,1) and (5,3). Based on the results obtained, possible crossovers between static friction modes taking place upon changing the twist angle in a macroscopic superlubric system consisting of identical layers are discussed. Additionally it is shown that the PES for relaxed structures can still be approximated by the first Fourier harmonics compatible with symmetries of twisted layers analogously to the PES for rigid layers.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

The obtained unified expressions for the components of the polarization tensor are equally applicable in the regions of the on- and off-the-mass-shell electromagnetic waves. The advantages of the presented formalism are demonstrated on the example of nonequilibrium Casimir force in the configuration of two parallel graphene-coated dielectric plates one of which is either hotter or colder than the environment. This force is investigated as a function of temperature, the energy gap, and chemical potential of graphene coatings with account of the effects of spatial dispersion. Besides the thermodynamically nonequilibrium Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces, the obtained form of the polarization tensor can be useful for investigation of many diverse physical phenomena in graphene systems, such as surface plasmons, reflectances, electrical conductivity, radiation heat transfer, etc.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Heavy Fermions as an Efficient Representation of Atomistic Strain and Relaxation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13880v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the strongly interacting flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have been approached using the minimal Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) Hamiltonian, there is mounting evidence that strain and lattice relaxation are essential in correctly determining the order of the correlated insulator groundstates. These effects can be incorporated in an enhanced continuum model by introducing additional terms computed from the relaxation profile. To develop an analytical and physical understanding of these effects, we include strain and relaxation in the topological heavy fermion (HF) model of TBG. We find that strain and relaxation are very well captured in first order perturbation theory by projection onto the fully symmetric HF Hilbert space, and remarkably do not alter the interacting terms in the periodic Anderson model. Their effects are fully incorporated in the single-particle HF Hamiltonian, and can be reproduced in a minimal model with only 4 symmetry-breaking terms. Our results demonstrate that the heavy fermion framework of TBG is an efficient and robust representation of the perturbations encountered in experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent Graphene-Superconductor Interfaces: Quantum Hall and Zero Field Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13307v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study clean, edge-contacted graphene/superconductor interfaces in both the quantum Hall (QH) and zero field regimes. We find that Andreev reflection is substantially stronger than at an interface with a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas: the large velocity at graphene's conical Dirac points makes the requirement of current continuity to a metal much less restrictive. In both our tight-binding and continuum models, we find a wide range of parameters for which Andreev reflection is strong. For a transparent interface, we demonstrate the following for graphene in the lowest Landau level QH state: (i) Excellent electron-hole hybridization occurs: the electron and hole components in graphene are simply related by an exchange of sublattice. The spatial profile for the electron component is predominantly gaussian on one sublattice and peaked at the interface, and so very different from the QH edge state of a terminated lattice. (ii) The degree of hybridization is independent of the graphene filling: no fine-tuning is needed. (iii) The spectrum is valley degenerate: the dispersion of each chiral Andreev edge mode (CAEM) self-aligns to be antisymmetric about the center of each valley, independent of filling. Achieving a transparent interface requires the absence of any barrier as well as a superconductor that is suitably matched to graphene; we argue that the latter condition is not very stringent. We further consider the effect of reduced transparency and Zeeman splitting on both the wavefunctions of the CAEM and their dispersion.</p></details> | 25 pages, 21 figures |

Besides controlling widths and edge structures, the inclusion of chirality in GNRs brings another dimension for fine-tuning their optoelectronic properties, but related studies remain elusive owing to the absence of feasible synthetic strategies. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of cove-edged chiral GNRs (CcGNRs) with a tunable chiral vector (n,m). Notably, the bandgap and effective mass of (n,2)- CcGNR show a distinct positive correlation with the increasing value of n, as indicated by theory. Within this GNR family, two representative members, namely, (4,2)- CcGNR and (6,2)-CcGNR, are successfully synthesized. Both CcGNRs exhibit prominently curved geometries arising from the incorporated [4]helicene motifs along their peripheries, as also evidenced by the single-crystal structures of the two respective model compounds (1 and 2). The chemical identities and optoelectronic properties of (4,2)- and (6,2)-CcGNRs are comprehensively investigated via a combination of IR, Raman, solid-state NMR, UV-vis, and THz spectroscopies as well as theoretical calculations. In line with theoretical expectation, the obtained (6,2)-CcGNR possesses a low optical bandgap of 1.37 eV along with charge carrier mobility of 8 cm2/Vs, whereas (4,2)-CcGNR exhibits a narrower bandgap of 1.26 eV with increased mobility of 14 cm2/Vs. This work opens up a new avenue to precisely engineer the bandgap and carrier mobility of GNRs by manipulating their chiral vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous mass inversion enriched quantum anomalous Hall states in multilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13229v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, both $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ QAH states have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG) arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism, driven by the interplay between trigonal warping and staggered layer order under an applied displacement field. Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands into a central touching point and three "leg" Dirac cones. In the presence of staggered layer order, this splitting enables mass inversions driven by the displacement field to occur asynchronously at the central touching point and the "leg" Dirac cones, potentially leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal multilayer graphene systems, predicting the existence of additional QAH states beyond $C = \pm N, \pm 2N$ for $N$-layer graphene.</p></details> |  |

After obtaining the solutions of the energy spectrum, we compute the scattering coefficients. These allow us to show how efficiently the electrons diffuse and how their probability density is distributed in space. Our results show that light polarization is key in controlling electron scattering. It affects electron localization near the GQDs and the strength of the scattering coefficients. We also investigate how light intensity and magnetic flux affect the formation of quasi-bound states. In addition, the electrostatic potential reduces the density of scattering states and fine-tunes the interaction between electrons and the quantum dot. This research improves our understanding of electron behavior in graphene nanostructures and suggests new ways to control electronic states at the quantum level.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

In periodically driven pre-thermalized systems, steady-state occupation of Floquet states is predicted to occur when coupled to a bath, while these states have projected occupation instantaneously after the driving starts. We study how these two regimes can give markedly different responses in optical transport properties. In particular, our results show that steady-state occupation leads to near-quantized optical Hall conductivity for a range of driving parameters in twisted bilayer graphene, whereas projected occupation leads to non-quantized values. We discuss the experimental feasibility of probing such non-equilibrium states in twisted bilayer graphene.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Our main result is that in the basis of the flat band and hidden wave functions the flat band could be interpreted as Landau level in the external magnetic field.

While water/graphene interactions are well studied, water on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) remains largely unexplored. Despite structural similarity to graphene, h-BN's slightly polar B-N bonds impart a large band gap, high thermal conductivity, and chemical stability, making it promising for electronics, lubricants, and coatings. Moreover, existing water studies often focus on multilayer water dynamics, overlooking single-molecular details. We bridge this gap by studying single-molecular water friction and diffusion on h-BN, comparing it with graphene using helium spin-echo experiments and ab initio calculations. Our findings show that water diffusion on h-BN/Ni follows a complex rotational-translational dynamic, unlike graphene. While conventional views treat water motion as discrete jumps between equivalent adsorption sites, we demonstrate that on h-BN, water molecules rotate freely around their centre of mass. Although the binding energies of water on h-BN and graphene are similar, the activation energy for water dynamics on h-BN is 2.5 times lower than on graphene, implying a much lower barrier for molecular mobility. The fundamentally different diffusion characteristics which classical models cannot capture, underscores the need to rethink how we model water on polar 2D materials. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the metal substrate strongly influences water friction, with h-BN/Ni showing a markedly lower friction than graphene/Ni, in stark contrast to the free-standing materials. These findings challenge assumptions about 2D material-water interactions, highlighting the crucial role of substrate effects in chemistry and material science and offer insights for designing next-generation microfluidic devices that require precise water mobility control.</p></details> |  |

Devices with four- and eight-layer differentiated contacts were analyzed, revealing that in a nanoribbon geometry (four contacts), a counterflow current emerges in the top layer, while in a square-junction configuration (eight contacts), this counterflow is accompanied by a transverse, or Hall, component. These effects persist despite weak coupling to contacts, onsite disorder, and variations in device size. The observed counterflow response indicates a circulating interlayer current, which generates an in-plane magnetic moment excited by the injected current.

In the presence of an out-of-plane electric field, the low energy physics is best described by a network of chiral domain-wall states. Depending on system parameters, they lead to the emergence of zig-zag or pseudo-Landau level modes with distinct transport characteristics. Specifically, we find zig-zag modes feature linear dispersion of Andreev bound states, resulting in a $4\pi$-periodic Josephson current. In contrast, pseudo-Landau level modes exhibit flat Andreev bound states and, consequently, a vanishing bulk Josephson current. Interestingly, edge states can give rise to $4\pi$-periodic Josephson response in the pseudo-Landau level regime. We also discuss experimental signatures of such responses.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

This type of model exhibits a V-shaped to U-shaped transition in the density of the states of the superconductor, and was phenomenologically used as a possible interpretation of recent tunneling experiments in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG)~[Kim {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 606}, 494-500 (2022)]. Performing a microscopic investigation, we find that such a qualitative difference in behavior occurs when the electron and hole chemical potentials change, leading to topological quantum phase transitions (TQPTs) between gapless and gapped $d$-wave superconducting states, due to the annihilation of chiral Dirac fermions at the phase boundaries. This transition requires the vanishing of the coherence peaks in the density of states at zero energy when the phase boundary is crossed, but this is not seen in the experimental data of Kim {\it et al.} (2022). We also show that direct thermodynamic signatures of these topological quantum phase transitions arise in the theoretical compressibility, which exhibits logarithmic singularities at the transition points. Measurements of the compressibility may illuminate the interpretation of the experimental data of Kim {\it et al.} (2022) and provide additional information about topological quantum phase transitions in the superconducting state of MATTG. Based on our analysis, we are led to conclude that the V-shaped to U-shaped transition observed is not related to annihilation of Dirac fermion quasiparticles and its associated TQPTs, but is possibly connected to a change in symmetry of the order parameter from a nodal to a non-nodal superconducting phase.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Visualising these paths in novel devices produced by scalable processes would provide a quality assessment method that can propel the device performance metrics towards commercial use. Here, we use high-resolution nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry to visualise the charge flow in gold-contacted, single-layer graphene devices produced by scalable methods. Modulating the majority carrier type via field effect reveals a strong asymmetry between the spatial current distributions in the electron and hole regimes that we attribute to an inhomogeneous microscopic potential landscape, inaccessible to conventional measurement techniques. In addition, we observe large, unexpected, differences in charge flow through nominally identical gold-graphene contacts. Moreover, we find that the current transfer into the graphene occurs several microns before the metal contact edge. Our findings establish high-resolution NV-magnetometry as a key tool for characterizing scalable 2D material based devices, uncovering quality deficits of the material, substrate, and electrical contacts that are invisible to conventional methods.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a novel device architecture allowing a simultaneous control over the applied displacement field and the crystalline alignment between two materials. Our experimental and numerical results confirm that the crystal field and electrostatic doping due to the interface reflect the 120$^{\circ}$ symmetry of the bilayer graphene/BN heterostructure and are highly affected by the commensurate state. These results provide an unique insight into the role of twist angle in the development of internal crystal fields and intrinsic electrostatic doping in heterostructures. Our results highlight the importance of layer alignment, beyond the existence of a moir\'e superlattice, to understand the intrinsic properties of a heterostructure.</p></details> |  |

We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect in RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its appearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values.

However, the non-Hermitian phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene remain unexplored. In this work, we study a non-Hermitian TBG formed by one-layer graphene twisted relative to another layer with gain and loss. Using a non-Hermitian generalization of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model, we find Dirac cones centered at only the $K_M$ ($K'_M$) corner of the moir\'e Brillouin zone at the $K'$ ($K$) valley deform into rings of exceptional points in the presence of non-Hermiticity, which is different from single-layer graphene with gain and loss, where exceptional rings appear in both $K$ and $K'$ corners of the Brillouin zone. We show that the exceptional rings are protected by non-Hermitian chiral symmetry. More interestingly, at an ``exceptional magic angle" larger than the Hermitian magic angle, the exceptional rings coincide and form non-Hermitian flat bands with zero energy and a finite lifetime. These non-Hermitian flat bands in the moir\'e system, which are isolated from dispersive bands, are distinguished from those in non-Hermitian frustrated lattices. In addition, we find that the non-Hermitian flat band has topological charge conserved in the moir\'e Brillouin zone, which is allowed for analogs of non-Hermitian fractional quantum Hall states.</p></details> | <details><summary>final...</summary><p>final version,9 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.</p></details> |  |

We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + appendices, 2 figures, comments welcome! v2: added references, restructured results</p></details> |

A promising direction for such utility is offered by the simulation of the dynamics of many-body quantum systems, which cannot be efficiently computed classically. Recently, IBM used a superconducting quantum computer to simulate a kicked quantum Ising model with large numbers of qubits and time steps. These results were later reproduced using numerical techniques based on tensor networks and Clifford expansion. In this work, we analyze the experiment in the eyes of a simple-minded mean-field approximation. We treat neighboring qubits as a self-consistent source of dephasing and express them in terms of Kraus operators. Although our approach completely disregards entanglement between qubits, it captures the overall dependence of physical observables as a function of time and external magnetic field. This observation can help rationalize the success of the quantum computer in solving this specific problem.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267v5)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |

We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach employs coupled-wire constructions and introduces a lattice duality to construct a solvable chiral sliding Luttinger liquid, which is driven towards the CSL phase by generic perturbations. By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a four-fold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground state degeneracies, fractional quasi-particles, non-vanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.</p></details> | 23 pages, 26 figures |

This is especially true for the superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures used to build Majorana-based topological qubits, where quantitatively understanding the interplay of topological superconductivity, disorder, semiconductor quantum dots, Coulomb blockade and noise has been essential for progress on device design and interpretation of measurements. In this paper, we describe a general framework to simulate the low-energy quantum dynamics of such complex systems. We illustrate our approach by computing the dispersive gate sensing (DGS) response of quantum dots coupled to topological superconductors. We start by formulating the DGS response as an open-system quantum dynamics problem, which allows a consistent treatment of drive backaction as well as quantum and classical noise. For microscopic quantum problems subject to Coulomb-blockade, where a direct solution in the exponentially large many-body Hilbert space would be prohibitive, we introduce a series of controlled approximations that incorporate ideas from tensor network theory and quantum chemistry to reduce this Hilbert space to a few low-energy degrees of freedom that accurately capture the low-energy quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the methods introduced in this paper on the example of a single quantum dot coupled to a topological superconductor and a microscopic realization of the fermion parity readout setup of Aghaee et al. arXiv:2401.09549 (2024).</p></details> | 28 pages, 14 figures |

The evolution of energy and pressure is strongly correlated with the rise of the spatial entanglement entropy, indicating a key role of quantum dynamics. Some of these observations may be used to analyze high multiplicity jet fragmentation events, energy-energy and energy-charge correlators at current collider energies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, Supplementary Material included</p></details> |

It is demonstrated that a significant class of MPS can be derived as the outcomes of EHMMs, showcasing their underlying quantum correlations. Additionally, a lower bound is derived for the relative entropy between the EHMM-observation process and the corresponding MPS, providing a quantitative measure of their informational divergence. Conversely, it is shown that every MPS is naturally associated with an EHMM, further highlighting the interplay between these frameworks. These results are supported by illustrative examples from quantum information, emphasizing their importance in understanding entanglement, quantum correlations, and tensor network representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vertex Representation of Hyperbolic Tensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03426v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a vertex representation of the tensor network (TN) for classical spin systems on hyperbolic lattices. The tensors form a network of regular $p$-sided polygons ($p>4$) with the coordination number four. The response to multi-state spin systems on the hyperbolic TN is analyzed for their entire parameter space. We show that entanglement entropy is sensitive to distinguish various hyperbolic geometries whereas other thermodynamic quantities are not. We test the numerical accuracy of vertex TNs in the phase transitions of the first, second, and infinite order at the point of maximal entanglement entropy. The hyperbolic structure of TNs induces non-critical properties in the bulk although boundary conditions significantly affect the total free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Thus developed vertex-type TN can be used for the lowest-energy quantum states on the hyperbolic lattices.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

| **[Lee-Yang formalism for phase transitions of interacting fermions using tensor networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01503v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the phase diagram of interacting quantum many-body systems is a challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Strong interactions and correlation effects may lead to exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids and unconventional superconductors, that often compete with other symmetry broken states including ordered magnets and charge density waves. Here, we put forward a formalism for determining the phase diagram of fermionic systems that combines recent progress in the field of Lee-Yang theory of phase transitions with many-body tensor-network methods. Using this strategy, we map out the phase diagram of a fermionic chain, where charge density waves form owing to strong repulsion. Specifically, from the high cumulants of the order parameter, we extract the dominant zeros of the moment-generating function in chains of finite size. By extrapolating their positions to the thermodynamic limit, we determine the boundaries between competing phases. Our formalism provides a strategy for determining critical points in fermionic systems, and it is based on fluctuations of the order parameter, which are measurable quantities.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Alternating and Gaussian fermionic Isometric Tensor Network States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10695v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Isometric tensor networks in two dimensions enable efficient and accurate study of quantum many-body states, yet the effect of the isometric restriction on the represented quantum states is not fully understood. We address this question in two main contributions. First, we introduce an improved variant of isometric network states (isoTNS) in two dimensions, where the isometric arrows on the columns of the network alternate between pointing upward and downward, hence the name alternating isometric tensor network states. Second, we introduce a numerical tool -- isometric Gaussian fermionic TNS (isoGfTNS) -- that incorporates isometric constraints into the framework of Gaussian fermionic tensor network states. We demonstrate in numerous ways that alternating isoTNS represent many-body ground states of two-dimensional quantum systems significantly better than the original isoTNS. First, we show that the entanglement in an isoTNS is mediated along the isometric arrows and that alternating isoTNS mediate entanglement more efficiently than conventional isoTNS. Second, alternating isoTNS correspond to a deeper, thus more representative, sequential circuit construction of depth $\mathcal{O}(L_x \cdot L_y)$ compared to the original isoTNS of depth $\mathcal{O}(L_x + L_y)$. Third, using the Gaussian framework and gradient-based energy minimization, we provide numerical evidences of better bond-dimension scaling and variational energy of alternating isoGfTNS for ground states of various free fermionic models, including the Fermi surface, the band insulator, and the $p_x + ip_y$ mean-field superconductor. Finally, we find improved performance of alternating isoTNS as compared to the original isoTNS for the ground state energy of the (interacting) transverse field Ising model.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persistent Haldane Phase in Carbon Tetris Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08252v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of tetris chains, which are linear arrays of 4-site molecules that differ by their intermolecular hopping geometry. We investigate the fermionic symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase in these systems using Hubbard-type models. The topological phase diagrams can be understood via different competing limits and mechanisms: strong-coupling $U\gg t$, weak-coupling $U\ll t$, and the weak intermolecular hopping limit $t'\ll t$. Our particular focus is on two tetris chains that are of experimental relevance. First, we show that a Y-chain of coarse-grained nanographene molecules (triangulenes) is robustly in the Haldane phase in the whole $t'-U$ plane due to the cooperative nature of the three limits. Secondly, we study a near-homogeneous Y$^{\prime}$-chain that is closely related to the electronic model for poly(p-phenylene vinylene). In the latter case, the above mechanisms compete, but the Haldane phase manifests robustly and is stable when long-ranged Pariser-Parr-Popple interactions are added. The site-edged Hubbard ladder can also be viewed as a tetris chain, which gives a very general perspective on the emergence of its fermionic Haldane phase. Our numerical results are obtained by large-scale, SU(2)-symmetric tensor network calculations. We employ the density-matrix-renormalization group as well as the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) algorithms for finite and infinite systems, respectively. The numerics are supplemented by analytical calculations of the bandstructure winding number.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-stabilizerness of Neural Quantum States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09725v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a methodology to estimate non-stabilizerness or "magic", a key resource for quantum complexity, with Neural Quantum States (NQS). Our framework relies on two schemes based on Monte Carlo sampling to quantify non-stabilizerness via Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) in arbitrary variational wave functions. When combined with NQS, this approach is effective for systems with strong correlations and in dimensions larger than one, unlike Tensor Network methods. Firstly, we study the magic content in an ensemble of random NQS, demonstrating that neural network parametrizations of the wave function capture finite non-stabilizerness besides large entanglement. Secondly, we investigate the non-stabilizerness in the ground state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. In 1D, we find that the SRE vanishes at the Majumdar-Ghosh point $J_2 = J_1/2$, consistent with a stabilizer ground state. In 2D, a dip in the SRE is observed near maximum frustration around $J_2/J_1 \approx 0.6$, suggesting a Valence Bond Solid between the two antiferromagnetic phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 + 5...</summary><p>6 + 5 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses. We finally investigate the dissipative quench dynamics starting from a strongly-correlated superfluid state or from a Mott-insulating state; for the Bose-Hubbard chain initially confined in the superfluid-correlated regime, an unexpected strong decay of the density appearing at short times is revealed.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |

In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their practical usefulness and many operational aspects of hTN-based algorithms, like the optimization of hTNs, the generalization of standard contraction rules to an hybrid setting, and the design of application-oriented architectures have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm to perform ground state optimizations with hybrid Tree Tensor Networks (hTTNs), discussing its advantages and roadblocks, and identifying a set of promising applications. We benchmark our approach on two paradigmatic models, namely the Ising model at the critical point and the Toric code Hamiltonian. In both cases, we successfully demonstrate that hTTNs can improve upon classical equivalents with equal bond dimension in the classical part.</p></details> | 21 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Quantum Supercritical Crossover with Dynamical Singularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05455v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supercritical states, characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena, emerge above the critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercriticality from classical to quantum systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is revealed, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is a critical exponent. Moreover, we uncover the QSC crossover line defines a boundary for the dynamical singularity to appear in quench dynamics, which can be ascribed to the intersection between the Lee-Yang zero line and the real-time axis. In particular, when the Hamiltonian parameter is quenched to the QSC crossover line, a singular cusp with exponent 1/2 emerge in the Loschmidt rate function, signaling a new dynamical universality class different from the linear cusp for $h=0$. Possible platforms, such as quantum simulators and quantum magnets are proposed for studying QSC crossovers in experiments. Our work paves the way for exploring QSC crossovers in and out of equilibrium in quantum many-body systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+2+2...</summary><p>8+2+2 pages, 5+3+2 figures</p></details> |

By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. Physically, we first separate the free energy contribution in $2$-SRE. At quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the characteristic function contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, by analyzing the volume-law correction of magic, which represents nonlocal magic residing in correlations, we find that its discontinuity is bound to critical properties and would be more useful than the full-state magic. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

While submatrix updates were originally developed for Hirsch-Fye QMC with onsite interactions at finite temperatures [Phys. Rev. B 80, 195111 (2009)], their comprehensive application in DQMC has remained unexplored despite noted algorithmic similarities. We present the first comprehensive application of submatrix updates in DQMC, significantly extending beyond the original scope by enabling simulations with extended interactions and at zero temperature. Building upon conventional fast updates and delay updates, our generalized implementation achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, enabling simulations of the half-filled Hubbard model on lattices up to 8,000 sites - a scale previously challenging with standard DQMC implementations. This enhanced computational capability allows us to accurately determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16709v5)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonequilibrium dynamics in Dirac quantum criticality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10601v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Nevertheless, the nonequilibrium dynamics therein has rarely been studied. To fill in the gap, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. Particularly, a new dynamic exponent characterizing the non-stationary evolution in the short-imaginary-time stage is determined as $\theta=-0.84(4)$, in sharp contrast with the prevalent belief that $\theta$ is positive as demonstrated in classical cases. Furthermore, we propose a universal dynamic scaling theory governing the fruitful nonequilibrium properties in Dirac quantum criticality. Armed with the scaling theory, we develop a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+10 ...</summary><p>7+10 pages, 5+8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Transient dynamical phase diagram of the spin-boson model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18561v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the real-time dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model across a broad range of coupling strengths, using the numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. From short- and intermediate-time dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the associated values of the critical exponent. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite temperature fermion Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated spin-Peierls systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06565v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Abrikosov fermion representation of the spin-1/2 degree of freedom allows for auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated spin systems. This approach provides a manifold of equivalent actions over which the negative sign problem can be optimised. As a result, we can reach temperature scales well below the magnetic scale. Here, we show how to generalise this algorithm to spin-Peierls systems. In contrast to exact diagonalisation approaches, Monte Carlo methods are not Hilbert space bound such that the computational effort per sweep remains invariant when adding phonons. However, the computational effort required to generate independent configurations increases in the presence of phonons. We also show that, for the specific case of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, the inclusion of phonons does not render the negative sign problem more severe. This new algorithm hence allows us to investigate the interplay between phonon degrees of freedom and magnetic frustration. We present results for frustrated and non-frustrated spin systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, article</p></details> |
| **[Sampling Electronic Fock States using Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18246v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analog quantum simulation based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the study of quantum many-body systems. These simulations rely on the statistical sampling of electronic Fock states, which are not easily accessible in classical algorithms. In this work, we modify the determinant quantum Monte Carlo by integrating a Fock-state update mechanism alongside the auxiliary field. This method enables efficient sampling of Fock-state configurations. The Fock-state restrictive sampling scheme further enables the pre-selection of multiple ensembles at no additional computational cost, thereby broadening the scope of simulation to more general systems and models. Employing this method, we analyze static correlations of the Hubbard model up to the fourth order and achieve quantitative agreement with cold-atom experiments. The simulations of dynamical spectroscopies of the Hubbard and Kondo-lattice models further demonstrate the reliability and advantage of this method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Non-linear Quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05094v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mean of a random variable can be understood as a $\textit{linear}$ functional on the space of probability distributions. Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating $\textit{non-linear}$ functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al.. The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors. A key innovation of our approach is a new sequence of multilevel Monte Carlo approximations specifically designed for quantum computing, which is central to the algorithm's improved performance.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Scaling corrections in driven critical dynamics: Application to a two-dimensional dimerized quantum Heisenberg model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04927v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven critical dynamics in quantum phase transitions holds significant theoretical importance, and also practical applications in fast-developing quantum devices. While scaling corrections have been shown to play important roles in fully characterizing equilibrium quantum criticality, their impact on nonequilibrium critical dynamics has not been extensively explored. In this work, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in a two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model. We find that in this model the scaling corrections arising from both finite system size and finite driving rate must be incorporated into the finite-time scaling form in order to properly describe the nonequilibrium scaling behaviors. In addition, improved scaling relations are obtained from the expansion of the full scaling form. We numerically verify these scaling forms and improved scaling relations for different starting states using the nonequilibrium quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Of particular interest is excitons, which are particle/hole excitations in low-dimensional systems. They are analogous to the pion in QCD, but without confinement, the question of whether they are bound and stable is of great interest in the condensed matter arena.

| **[Correlation Effects in a Simplified Bilayer Two-Orbital Hubbard Model at Half Filling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12042v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01264v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Quantum State Study of Fracton Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11677v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 21 figures, (Re-)Submission to SciPost Added X-cube simulations, extended Figure 9 (and additional Figure 20), added references</p></details> |
| **[Particle-wave dichotomy in quantum Monte Carlo: unlocking the quantum correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03298v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here, a dichotomy of particles and waves is employed in a quantum Monte Carlo calculation of interacting electrons. Through the creation and propagation of concurrent stochastic ensembles of walkers in physical space and in Hilbert space one can correctly predict the ground state and the real-time evolution of a single electron interacting with larger quantum system. It is shown that such walker ensembles can be constructed straightforwardly through a stochastic sampling (windowing) applied to the mean-field approximation. Our calculations reveal that the ground state and the real-time evolution of the probability distributions and the decoherence due to the Coulomb interaction in presence of strong ultrashort laser pulse can be accounted for correctly by calculating the density matrix of the electron, without referencing to the quantum many-body state of the whole system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+9 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Charge fluctuations, hydrodynamics and transport in the square-lattice Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04047v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling, we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the strong-coupling regimes.</p></details> | 27 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18937v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave functions in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schr\"odinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges) via the Land\'e subtraction method. Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

This problem is known to depend on the choice of representation basis. We propose a systematic approach for mitigating the sign problem independent of the given Hamiltonian or lattice structure. We first introduce the concept of negativity to characterize the severity of the negative sign problem. We then demonstrate the existence of a locally defined quantity, the L1 adaptive loss function, which effectively approximates negativity, especially in frustration-free systems. Using the proposed loss function, we demonstrate that optimizing the representation basis can mitigate the negative sign. This is evidenced by several frustration-free models and other important quantum spin systems. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unitary transformations against the standard orthogonal transformation and reveal that unitary transformations can effectively mitigate the sign problem in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures.

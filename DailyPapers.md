| **[Learning dynamics on the picosecond timescale in a superconducting synapse structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02754v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are running into limitations in terms of training time and energy. Following the principles of the human brain, spiking neural networks trained with unsupervised learning offer a faster, more energy-efficient alternative. However, the dynamics of spiking, learning, and forgetting become more complicated in such schemes. Here we study a superconducting electronics implementation of a learning synapse and experimentally measure its spiking dynamics. By pulsing the system with a superconducting neuron, we show that a superconducting inductor can dynamically hold the synaptic weight with updates due to learning and forgetting. Learning can be stopped by slowing down the arrival time of the post-synaptic pulse, in accordance with the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity paradigm. We find excellent agreement with circuit simulations, and by fitting the turn-on of the pulsing frequency, we confirm a learning time of 16.1 +/- 1 ps. The power dissipation in the learning part of the synapse is less than one attojoule per learning event. This leads to the possibility of an extremely fast and energy-efficient learning processor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. Here, we show that the LC order fundamentally changes the nature of the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In a single-orbital model on the kagome lattice near van Hove filling, the LC CDW is a Chern metal, realizable in concrete models, with a partially filled Chern band hosting three Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). We show that Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs is described by three SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings due to LC. The pairing instability is determined by the eigenvalues of the complex representation of the cubic group. We show that the Josephson phase is controlled by the discrete quantum geometry associated with the sublattice permutation group. A small LC can produce a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to a roton superconductor, where the internal phases of the three SC components are locked at 120^\circ and loop supercurrents circulate around an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. We demonstrate by self-consistent calculations the properties of the roton superconductor and make theoretical predictions related to the recent experimental evidence for an exotic SC state in CsV3Sb5 exhibiting TRS breaking, anisotropic SC gap, pair density wave modulations, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems such as the moire structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>16+2 ...</summary><p>16+2 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced coherent terahertz emission from critical superconducting fluctuations in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02568v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coherent terahertz (THz) emission is emerging as a powerful new tool to probe symmetry breakings in quantum materials. This method relies on second order optical nonlinearities and is complementary to second harmonic generation spectroscopy. Here, we report coherent THz emission from Josephson plasmons in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, and find that the amplitude of the emitted field increases dramatically close to the superconducting transition temperature, $T_C$. We show theoretically how emission is enhanced by critical superconducting fluctuations, a nonlinear analogue of critical opalescence. This observation is expected to be of general importance for the study of many thermal and quantum phase transitions.</p></details> | 33 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in the Medium-Entropy/High-Entropy Re-based Alloys with a Non-Centrosymmetric $Î±$-Mn Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02556v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medium or high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) and rhenium-based compounds with a non-centrosymmetric (NC) structure have received a lot of attention for offering a fertile soil in search for unconventional superconductivity. Here, five previously unreported NC Re-based MEA-HEA superconductors with an $\alpha$-Mn lattice are successfully synthesized, with their superconducting transition temperatures (Tcs) ranging from 4 to 5 K. An increase in the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) can be achieved by modulating the valence electron count (VEC) through compositional adjustments. Magnetization measurements confirm that all the synthesized Re-based MEA-HEAs are bulk type-II superconductors. Specific heat analysis reveals that the superconducting state of these HEAs can be well described by a single-gap s-wave model. Our results show that the Kadowaki-Woods ratio of these $\alpha$-Mn MEA/HEA superconductors are close to the typical value of heavy fermion compounds, suggesting the existence of strong electronic correlation. These findings provide promising material platforms to study the role of high disorder in the origin of superconductivity in the NC MEAs-HEAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Super...</summary><p>Superconductor Science and Technology, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02405v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the electron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K. TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate an irradiated NbN SNSPD exhibiting a well-defined saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by irradiation-induced modifications and an avalanche-assisted detection mechanism with weak wavelength dependence. Our findings provide valuable insights into ion irradiation as a post-processing technique for SNSPDs, offering a pathway to enhancing IDE and tailoring thermal properties. This work also advances the understanding of SNSPD physics and defect engineering in superconducting thin films, expanding the potential applications of irradiation techniques in superconducting optoelectronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01271v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation of Quantum Darwinism and the Origin of Classicality with Superconducting Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00781v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,4 figures + supplementary information</p></details> |
| **[Emergence of Diffusional Hydrogen Escape in High-$T_c$ Superconducting Calcium Superhydride at Megabar Pressures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12618v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-pressure metal superhydrides have attracted intense scientific interest due to their remarkable superconducting properties. While superconductivity is known to be sensitive to material composition, compositional variability is often overlooked in metal superhydrides at megabar pressures. Using ab initio path-integral simulations, we find that up to 7 % of the hydrogen atoms escape from the 215-kelvin superconducting CaH$_6$ upon decompression from 165 to 123 GPa. This loss of hydrogen leads to an elastic instability at low pressures, an "abnormal" positive pressure dependence of the superconducting $T_c$ and a quantum phase transition from a mixed superconducting-diffusive state to a pure superconducting phase. In this mixed phase, proton diffusivity reaches $10^{-8}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at low temperatures and promotes to $10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at room temperature, which elucidates the escape of hydrogen at megabar pressures. Our results are consistent with many "anomalous" experimental observations and highlight the significance of composition effects in high-$T_c$ metal superhydrides.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Scalable quantum eraser for superconducting integrated circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16893v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fast and scalable scheme for multi-qubit resetting in superconducting quantum processors is proposed by exploiting the feasibility of frequency-tunable transmon qubits and transmon-like couplers to engineer a full programmable superconducting erasing head. The scalability of the device is verified by simultaneously resetting two qubits, where we show that collectivity effects may emerge as an fundamental ingredient to speed up the erasing process. Conversely, we also describe the appearance of decoherence-free subspace in multi-qubit chips, causing it to damage the device performance. To overcome this problem, a special set of parameters for the tunable frequency coupler is proposed, which allows us to erase even states within such subspace. To end, we offer a proposal to buildup integrated superconducting processors that can be efficiently connected to erasure heads in a scalable way.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18441v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Majorana zero modes and the superconducting diode effect driven by Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing in a helical Shiba chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11784v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in our system where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the presence of finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO ground state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the superconducting diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the published version</p></details> |
| **[Fully-gapped superconductivity with rotational symmetry breaking in pressurized kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01763v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ has generated significant interest in its complex physical properties, particularly its superconducting behavior under different pressures, though its nature remains debated. Here, we performed low-temperature, high-pressure $^{121/123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to explore the superconducting pairing symmetry in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. At ambient pressure, we found that the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/$T_1$ exhibits a kink at $T \sim$ 0.4 $T_\textrm{c}$ within the superconducting state and follows a $T^3$ variation as temperature further decreases. This suggests the presence of two superconducting gaps with line nodes in the smaller one. As pressure increases beyond $P_{\rm c} \sim 1.85$ GPa, where the charge-density wave phase is completely suppressed, 1/$T_1$ shows no Hebel-Slichter peak just below $T_\textrm{c}$, and decreases rapidly, even faster than $T^5$, indicating that the gap is fully opened for pressures above $P_{\rm c}$. In this high pressure region, the angular dependence of the in-plane upper critical magnetic field $H_{\rm c2}$ breaks the $C_6$ rotational symmetry. We propose the $s+id$ pairing at $P > P_{\rm c}$ which explains both the 1/$T_1$ and $H_{\rm c2}$ behaviors. Our findings indicate that CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an unconventional superconductor and its superconducting state is even more exotic at high pressures.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Nature Communications</p></details> |
| **[Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing with a Parametric Superconducting Resonator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19968v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum metrology, a cornerstone of quantum technologies, exploits entanglement and superposition to achieve higher precision than classical protocols in parameter estimation tasks. When combined with critical phenomena such as phase transitions, the divergence of quantum fluctuations is predicted to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Here, we implement a critical quantum sensor using a superconducting parametric (i.e., two-photon driven) Kerr resonator. The sensor, a linear resonator terminated by a supercondicting quantum interference device, operates near the critical point of a finite-component second-order dissipative phase transition obtained by scaling the system parameters. We analyze the performance of a frequency-estimation protocol and show that quadratic precision scaling with respect to the system size can be achieved with finite values of the Kerr nonlinearity. Since each photon emitted from the cavity carries more information about the parameter to be estimated compared to its classical counterpart, our protocol opens perspectives for faster or more precise metrological protocols. Our results demonstrate that quantum advantage in a sensing protocol can be achieved by exploiting a finite-component phase transition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order topological phases for time-reversal-symmetry breaking superconductivity in UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01584v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of heavy-fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ has broadened the possibility of realizing exotic time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity. However, a comprehensive understanding of the topological phases in the superconducting states of UTe$_2$ is still lacking. Here, we present an exhaustive classification of topological phases for all time-reversal symmetry breaking pairing symmetries of UTe$_2$. Using the K theoretical classification approach, we uncover that 25 out of 36 possible pairing states are classified as higher-order topological phases, with some demonstrating hybrid-order topology through an intricate interplay of hinge and corner states. Furthermore, under the weak-coupling condition of the pair potentials, the possible pairing symmetries are constrained to $B_{ju} + i B_{ku}$, $A_{u} + i B_{j u}$, and $B_{j g} + iA_u$ ($j,k = 1,2,3$; $j \neq k$), where these symbols denote the irreducible representations of the point group $D_{2h}$. For these pairing states, the topological invariants are related to the Fermi surface topology via the Fermi-surface formula, enabling us to systematically diagnose higher-order topological phases. Using a tight-binding model, we demonstrate the higher-order topological phases of the mixed-parity $A_u + iB_{1g}$ superconductors, where the second-order and hybrid-order topological phases emerge as the number of Fermi surfaces enclosing the time-reversal invariant momentum evolves from two to four. The findings suggest that UTe$_2$ serves as a compelling platform for exploring higher-order topological superconductors with diverse topological surface states.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Superconductivity up to 17 K in the high-pressure rhombohedral-I phase of ReO3: a potential oxide analogy of hydride superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09011v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an A-site-vacant perovskite-type oxide, ReO3 undergoes sequential pressure-driven structural transitions associated with the rotation of ReO6 octahedra. The rhombohedral-I phase in the pressure range of 12-39 GPa is featured by a lattice of nearly close-packed oxygen layers intercalated with Re cations, in reminiscent of the recently discovered superhydride superconductors. A combined study of first-principles calculations and transport measurements under high pressures enabled us to discover superconductivity in the rhombohedral-I phase, and it shows a dome-shaped Tc(P) with a maximum Tc of 17 K at about 30 GPa. In addition to the enhanced density of states at Fermi level compared to that of the ambient phase, the vibrations of hexagonal-close-packed oxygen lattice significantly strengthen the electron-phonon coupling, which is responsible for observed superconductivity with a relatively high Tc. The present work thus establishes a rare case among oxide superconductors that the light-element oxygen lattice plays a crucial role in inducing superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12710v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.</p></details> | 8 pages,3 figures |
| **[Signatures of Enhanced Superconducting Properties in Niobium Cavities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10601v4)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. Additionally, we report measurements of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of two Nb SRF cavities processed using distinct methods. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Density Matrix Renormalization Group study of superconducting pairing near the quarter-filled Wigner crystal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08367v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Charge ordering is often found in the phase diagram of unconventional superconductors in close proximity to the superconducting state. This has led to the suggestion that fluctuations of charge order can mediate superconducting pairing. While several mechanisms can lead to charge order, one common mechanism is the long-range Coulomb interaction, resulting in a Wigner crystal charge ordered state. For an electron density of 0.5 per site we investigate the extended Hubbard model on the two-dimensional square lattice using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. Our results show that the strength of pairing decreases with the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction strength $V$ and remains weaker than the tendency of pairing for non-interacting electrons.</p></details> | 8 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Prethermalization by Random Multipolar Driving on a 78-Qubit Superconducting Processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21553v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-dependent drives hold the promise of realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is `doubly tunable': one way by driving frequency, the other by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent $2n{+}1$. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present a comprehensive study of TaIr$_2$B$_2$ (with $T_c$ = 5.1 K), using a set of complementary experimental methods, including bulk- and surface-sensitive techniques. We provide evidence that this system is a two-band, yet it behaves as a single-gap superconductor with a strong coupling. The upper critical field of TaIr$_2$B$_2$ significantly exceeds the Pauli limit and exhibits a nearly linear temperature dependence down to the lowest temperatures. This behavior, rarely seen in superconductors, is discussed in terms of anti-symmetric spin-orbit interaction, two-band-, and strong-coupling effects, as well as disorder.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, suppl. material</p></details> |

At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasi-particle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states and the associated onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ scattering may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity in the cuprates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Quantum Algorithm for Green's Functions Measurements in the Fermi-Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10412v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the framework of the hybrid quantum-classical variational cluster approach (VCA) to strongly correlated electron systems one of the goals of a quantum subroutine is to find single-particle correlation functions of lattice fermions in polynomial time. Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard test for this purpose, which requires an implementation of controlled single-particle fermionic operators. However, for a number of locality-preserving mappings to encode fermions into qubits, a direct construction of such operators is not possible. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm, which uses an analog of the Kubo formula adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly using only bilinears of fermionic operators and circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We test our new algorithm in practice by using open-access simulators of noisy IBM superconducting chips.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 29 figures, 4 tables, includes appendix</p></details> |

Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, we demonstrate the emergence of a topological Haldane phase, which results explicitly from the complementary effects of diagonal hopping-induced frustration and strong on-site Coulomb repulsion. The topological phase transition from a trivial insulator to the nontrivial Haldane phase is characterized by significant changes in magnetic properties, edge correlations, and the appearance of a nonzero string order parameter. Furthermore, we confirm the topological nature of this phase through a detailed analysis of the spin gap and entanglement spectrum, demonstrating clear signatures of symmetry-protected topological order.</p></details> | 12 pages, 16 figures |

We uncover the emergence of Floquet scarring states, a class of quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) states that defy random thermalization. The underlying physical mechanism is identified to be the Floquet resonances between these degenerate Fock bases that can be connected by one hopping process. It is the first-order hopping perturbation effect. Utilizing the degenerate Floquet perturbation theory, we derive the exact conditions under which the exotic QMBS states emerge. Phenomena such as quantum revivals and subharmonic responses are also studied. Those results open the possibility of modulating and engineering solid-state quantum many-body systems to achieve nonergodicity.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis reveals that the chaotic phase of the bare Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian can actually be enhanced by the presence of a moderate tilt. We further unveil the development and scaling of the chaotic regime from the perspective of a homogeneous density configuration typically used in cold atom experiments, providing a valuable phase diagram for future theoretical and experimental studies of this system.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J > 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial Time Quantum Gibbs Sampling for Fermi-Hubbard Model at any Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01412v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been several advancements in quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling. These algorithms simulate the dynamics generated by an artificial Lindbladian, which is meticulously constructed to obey a detailed-balance condition with the Gibbs state of interest, ensuring it is a stationary point of the evolution, while simultaneously having efficiently implementable time steps. The overall complexity then depends primarily on the mixing time of the Lindbladian, which can vary drastically, but which has been previously bounded in the regime of high enough temperatures [Rouz\'e et al. arXiv:2403.12691 and arXiv:2411.04885]. In this work, we calculate the spectral gap of the Lindbladian for free fermions using third quantisation, and also prove a logarithmic bound on its mixing time by analysing corresponding covariance matrices. Then we prove a constant gap of the perturbed Lindbladian corresponding to interacting fermions up to some maximal coupling strength. This is achieved by using theorems about stability of the gap for lattice fermions. Our methods apply at any constant temperature and independently of the system size. The gap then provides an upper bound on the mixing time, and hence on the overall complexity of the quantum algorithm, proving that the purified Gibbs state of weakly interacting (quasi-)local fermionic systems of any dimension can be prepared in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (n^3 \operatorname{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$ time on $\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits, where $n$ denotes the size of the system and $\epsilon$ the desired accuracy. As an application, we explain how to calculate partition functions for the considered systems. We provide exact numerical simulations for small system sizes supporting the theory and also identify different suitable jump operators and filter functions for the sought-after regime of intermediate coupling in the Fermi-Hubbard model.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 8 figures.

In this work, we conduct a systematic numerical analysis of quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators described by the extended ($U$-$V$) Hubbard model. We discuss the applicability of the analytical formula for doublon-holon (DH) pair production, previously derived for the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which highlights the relationship between the tunneling threshold, the charge gap, and the correlation length. We test the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy increase rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the formula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states facilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$. However, when excitonic states emerge, the formula more accurately describes the rate of energy increase than the DH pair creation rate and in both cases gets improved by incorporating the exciton energy as the effective gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages including bibliography and the appendix (11 pages without them), 8 figures in the main text and 1 in the appendix for a total of 9 figures, and 2 tables in the main text</p></details> |

Our key findings are: (1) Besides the expected hole to electron-like behavior change around half filling, we show that the additional sign change at an electronic density $n_s$ (and correspondingly a hole density $p_s$) is controlled by the opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states or compressibility and not by the pseudogap scale in the single particle density of states. (2) We find that $n_s(T,U)$ depends strongly on the interaction $U$ and shows an unusual non-monotonic dependence on temperature with a maximum at a temperature $T\approx t$, on the order of the hopping scale. (3) We identify local moment formation close to half filling as the main driver for the anomalous behavior of the thermoelectric transport coefficient.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

Theoretical models often focus on nearest-neighbor interactions, although long-range interactions can have a considerable impact on the behavior of the system, creating distinct and complicated magnetic phases. We investigate the consequences of competing interactions in a half-filled one-band Hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice, incorporating hopping processes up to third-nearest-neighbors, to explore the underlying magnetotransport properties. Our magnetic phase diagrams at low temperatures, obtained using semi-classical Monte Carlo analysis, reveal that the long-range interactions can disrupt one form of magnetic phase while creating a new type of magnetic order. For the nonperturbative regime (on-site Hubbard repulsive strength $U \sim$ bandwidth) the C-type antiferromagnetic ground state is preferred over the G-type antiferromagnetic phase when the interaction between second-nearest neighbor sites becomes significant to the nearest-neighbor interactions. However, interactions beyond the second-nearest-neighbors are required to stabilize the A-type antiferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, at low temperatures, a highly correlated paramagnetic insulating phase develops at the intersection between the antiferromagnetic phases, which might promote a three-dimensional spin-liquid state.</p></details> | 16 Pages, 12 Figures |

We describe the model finite-temperature transport properties in terms of the microscopic processes associated with the spin and charge elementary currents carried by the corresponding carriers. We expect that the general representation used in our study is that suitable to address the open problems on finite-temperature transport in the 1D Hubbard model also discussed in this paper.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |

Using the mean-field approximation, we show that multiphoton JCHM reveals quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI), superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phases. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. If this conserved quantity diverges to infinity, this system is in the BEC phase. Exploring this system we observe the MI, BEC, and superfluid phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs although the two-photon JCHM MI phases are restricted to the small conserved quantity subspace.

Here we show that twisted diamond homobilayers with band extrema at $Y$ valley can realize weakly-coupled chains with quasi-1D band structure; applying displacement field generates interchain hopping, transforming this quasi-1D system into a 2D one. The low-energy physics can be described by localized Wannier functions on the triangular lattice with tunable hopping anisotropy, providing a promising platform for studying the anisotropic triangular lattice Hubbard model. We further employ density matrix renormalization group to study this model with interaction $U=10t$ and anisotropy $0.5\leq t'/t\leq 1.5$ at half filling, and obtain a rich ground state phase diagram, including a chiral spin liquid phase, non-magnetic phases, and a N\'eel antiferromagnetic phase. This work provides a first realization of displacement-field tuned anisotropy in a single-band triangular Hubbard model within moir\'e systems, establishing them as a promising platform to investigate intriguing correlated physics with tunable anisotropy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18639v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.</p></details> | 26 pages, 20 figures |

This serves to ascertain the validity of the mean-field approximation under conditions such that the time-dependent nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation has chaotic solutions. It is shown that for sufficiently large particle numbers the exact N-particle Floquet state semiclassically associated with the innermost quantized invariant tube surrounding a stable periodic mean-field orbit represents a macroscopically occupied single-particle state, i.e., a Floquet condensate.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Understanding the ground-state physics of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard models away from the Heisenberg limit and from the spin-flavor balanced setting is important, as examining the flavor imbalance reveals new physics in Fermi-Hubbard models and shows how SU($N$) phases react to practical experimental imperfections in optical lattices. In this study, mean-field phase diagrams are presented for the unit-density SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model at two sets of flavor densities, $\left(\tfrac{1}{3}-\delta,\tfrac{1}{3}+\delta,\tfrac{1}{3}\right)$ and $\left(\tfrac{1}{4}-\delta,\tfrac{1}{4}+\delta,\tfrac{1}{2}\right)$, with the flavor imbalance introduced as $\delta$. Novel phases are identified at moderate interaction strengths for both densities and their robustness is investigated in the presence of flavor imbalance. Furthermore, we provide microscopic explanations of the phases found and their stability. Analysis of thermal ensembles of random mean-field solutions indicate that, at temperatures accessible in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments, some spin orders are hard for conventional scattering or local observable measurements to detect, but can be more accessible with quantum gas microscopy in optical lattice experiments. This work also shows that nesting and Mottness, intertwined in the usual SU(2) Hubbard model in stark contrast to generic materials, can be tuned in the SU(3) model and play distinct roles. The resulting phase diagrams not only deepen our understanding of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard models but also inform future experimental search for new phases.</p></details> |  |

| **[Particle Pairing Caused Subdiffusion of Heavy Particles in the Imbalanced Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15409v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imbalanced Hubbard model features a transition between dynamic regimes depending on the mass ratio and coupling strength between two different particle species. A slowdown of the lighter particle transport can be attributed to an emergent effective disorder induced by the heavy particles for high mass ratio and strong coupling. This subdiffusive regime has been interpreted as a Griffiths phase, linking the effect to the coexistence of metallic and insulating regions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the heavy particles, which also reveals subdiffusive behavior, yet cannot be explained within the Griffiths picture. We demonstrate that heavy particles predominantly form small clusters, mainly pairs, during the dynamical process, which reduces their propagation speed and transiently shifts the time-dependent diffusion constant into the subdiffusive regime at late times. The necessary attraction between particles driving this process can be understood within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We introduce a classical one-dimensional random walk model that can quantitatively reproduce the subdiffusion dynamics in the strong coupling regime.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

(i) Motivated by the recent experiment [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019)] which focused on the lower-energy dynamic behaviors of the dBH chain, we first show that, at low energies, for a thermalizing state, although the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the decrease of the total entropy over time, for part of the channel-resolved entropies, a long-term entropic reduction may arise at weak disorder. (ii) A companion channel-resolved analysis at strong disorder further hints that the priorly observed double-log growth of the number entropy might not directly indicate the breakdown of MBL in spin or fermion chains, providing a refreshing perspective on this major controversy in the community. (iii) From time-evolving the line-shape low-energy product state, we subsequently reveal an abrupt formation of a novel "entropy imbalance pattern" across the different symmetry channels. Intriguingly, this imbalance melts in the strong-disorder limit. We conjecture that the melting of the entropic pattern, together with the freezing of a concurrent particle-density wave, embodies a dual trait inherent to MBL. (iv) Specifically, we find a cluster MBL regime, unique to the Bose statistics, emerging from the higher-energy section. This cluster MBL regime realizable even at weak disorder appears not suffer from the finite-size drift and is distinguished by its absence of the hallmark of MBL - the unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy. Our theoretical predictions are by and large testable via the present experimental facilities.</p></details> |  |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |

However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 2...</summary><p>v1: 20 pages; v2: 21 pages; v3 22 pages, 9 figures; v4 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by PRB.

| **[Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the nearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain structure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and calculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair correlation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the hallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and charge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and the spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are gradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings suggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic bonds is favorable for superconductivity.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

The VMC results are in good agreement with the exact diagonalization (ED) calculation. For the single-hole case, the degenerate ground states are characterized by quantum numbers of a spin-1/2 and an orbital angular momentum $L_z=\pm 2$. The latter is associated with the emergent chiral spin/hole currents mutually surrounding the hole/spin-1/2 as a composite object or ``twisted hole''. A vanishing quasiparticle spectral weight is shown in the large-sample limit. In the two-hole ground state, the holes form a spin-singlet pairing with $d$+$id$ symmetry in the Cooper channel, but are of $s$-wave symmetry as a tightly bound pair of the ``twisted holes''. Such a pairing mechanism of dichotomy can be attributed to eliminating the local spin currents which has nothing to do with the long-range antiferromagnetic correlation. Superconducting ground state at finite doping is briefly discussed in terms of the tightly bound hole pairs as the building blocks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity.

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, achieving superconductivity in this system currently requires relatively high pressures. In this study, we propose a chemical pressure strategy via Sr substitution to stabilize high-Tc superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient conditions.Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1) at ambient pressure and identify two dynamically stable phases:La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$.Our calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallization of the $\sigma$-bonding bands dominated by Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals-a key feature associated with high-Tc superconductivity, as reported in the high-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Further analysis using tight-binding models shows that the key hopping parameters in La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$ closely resemble those of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, indicating that strong super-exchange interactions between interlayer Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals are preserved.

The La(2)$_{\rm a}$ site of the ideal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ is clearly distinguished from the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site close to the local defects. Below 150K, almost half of the intrinsic La(2)$_{\rm a}$ sites are dominated by a finite internal field within the $ab$ plane, while the other half are dominated by zero internal field. The result is fully consistent with the single spin-spinless stripe order of ($\cdots\uparrow\circ\downarrow\circ\uparrow\circ\cdots$), where the reduced Ni magnetic moments are parallel to the $ab$-plane. Even for the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site, the result is also explained within the same model by considering the inhomogeneous internal magnetic fields enhanced around the nearby defects such as oxygen vacancies.

We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility via Fermi surface nesting, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations.

Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML in our zero- and finite-temperature calculations. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

DFT+U calculations reveal that the A-type antiferromagnetic ground state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ persists throughout the studied pressure range. Electronic structure analysis shows that the Ni-$d_{xy}$ and Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level in both the $Fmmm$ and $Amam$ phases of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Phonon dispersion calculations for the $Fmmm$ phase reveal no imaginary modes from 12 to 29.5 GPa, confirming its dynamical stability in this pressure range. The vibrational frequencies of O atoms are substantially higher than those of Ni and La atoms, primarily due to the lower mass of oxygen. At 29.5 GPa, the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ for the $Fmmm$ phase is calculated to be 0.13. This small value suggests that conventional electron-phonon coupling is insufficient to explain the reported superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, indicating a potentially unconventional mechanism. The study offers nuanced, actionable insights that can strategically inform and direct subsequent experimental investigations into the design and optimization of nickel-based superconducting materials.</p></details> |  |

However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cell has significantly limited spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of the density waves and their interplay with superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that both the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are initially suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa. After the density wave collapse, a newly small charge gap associated to superconductivity opens at low temperatures. The extracted gap-to-T$_c$ ratio, $2\Delta_{SC}/ k_{B} T_{c} $, is found to be approximately 3, consistent with the weak coupling regime. These results suggest that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the layered nickelate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ with hybrid single-layer and bilayer stacking showed superconductivity under high pressure. This compound combines features of La$_2$NiO$_4$ and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but its pairing mechanism remains to be understood. Motivated by this finding, here we report a comprehensive theoretical study of this system. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the undistorted P4/mmm phase without pressure is unstable due to three distortion modes. Increasing pressure suppresses these modes and causes ``charge transfer'' between the single-layer and bilayer sublattices, leading to hole-doping in the single-layer blocks. Our random-phase approximation calculations indicate a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that arises from spin-fluctuation scattering between Fermi surface states mainly originating from the single-layer blocks and additional weaker contributions from the bilayer blocks. These spin-fluctuations could be detected by inelastic neutron scattering as a strong peak at ${\bf q}=(\pi, \pi)$. Our findings distinguish La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ from other nickelate superconductors discovered so far and the high-$T_c$ cuprates. We also discuss both similarities and differences between La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ and other hybrid stacking nickelates.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Microscopic insights into magnetism, which emerges near superconductivity, require a synergistic approach that combines complementary techniques with controlled parameter tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), resistivity, and specific heat measurements. At ambient pressure, two incommensurate spin density wave (SDW) transitions were identified at $T_{\rm SDW} \simeq 132$ K and $T^\ast \simeq 90$ K. NPD experiments revealed that the magnetic wave vector $(0, 0.574, 0)$ remains unchanged below 130 K, indicating that the transition at $T^\ast$ corresponds to a reorientation of the Ni magnetic moments within a similar magnetic structure. Comparison of the observed internal magnetic fields with dipole-field calculations reveals a magnetic structure consistent with an antiferromagnetically coupled SDW on the outer two Ni layers, with smaller moments on the inner Ni layer. The internal fields at muon stopping sites appeared abruptly at $T_{\rm SDW}$, suggesting a first-order-like nature of the SDW transition, which is closely linked to the charge density wave (CDW) order occurring at the same temperature ($T_{\rm SDW} = T_{\rm CDW}$). Under applied pressure, all transition temperatures, including $T_{\rm SDW}$, $T^\ast$, and $T_{\rm CDW}$, were suppressed at a nearly uniform rate of $\simeq -13$ K/GPa. This behavior contrasts with the double-layer RP nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where pressure enhances the separation of the density wave transitions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

This discovery of new family of high-temperature superconductors has garnered significant attention in the condensed matter physics community. In this work, we assume the this high-temperature superconductor is mediated by phonons and investigate the pairing symmetry in two distinct models: (i) the full-coupling case, where the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals are treated equally in both interlayer and intralayer coupling interactions, and (ii) the half-coupling case, where the intralayer coupling involves only the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, while the interlayer coupling is restricted to the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital. Our calculations reveal that the interlayer coupling favors an $s\pm$-wave superconducting state, whereas the intralayer coupling promotes an $s++$-wave symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications of pair-hopping interactions on the superconducting properties. These findings provide valuable insights into the pairing mechanisms and symmetry of this newly discovered high-temperature superconductor.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

The superconducting pairing symmetry is $s_\pm$-wave and is robust against the variation of the interaction strength. In this model, although the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are away from the Fermi level, the superconducting pairing function on them is not tiny. Instead, since the top of the $\gamma$ band and bottom of the $\delta$ band are both located at $\sim$500 meV away from the Fermi level, and they are almost nested by the peak structure in the spin fluctuation, thus by forming an anti-phase pairing function on them, these two bands act constructively to superconductivity. Finally with detailed derivation and numerical calculation, we demonstrate that the Fermi surface approximated Eliashberg equation may lead to deviation of the pairing symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.11429</p></details> |

However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.</p></details> |  |

In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we propose that superconductivity in this compound is primarily driven by interlayer pairing mechanisms. This interlayer pairing results in an effective $s_\pm$ pairing gap, with the sign of the pairing gap varying across different Fermi pockets. In the superconducting state, our analysis reveals a striking absence of a spin resonance mode. Moreover, we reveal a spectrum of energy-dependent incommensurate spin excitations. The observed incommensurate structures are elegantly explained by the nesting effect of energy contours, providing a coherent and comprehensive account of experimental observations. The implications of these spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are profound, offering critical insights into the superconducting mechanism at play. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of this novel superconductor but also pave the way for further research into the interplay between spin dynamics and unconventional superconductivity in layered materials.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

For La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/LaAlO$_3$(001), we find that compressive strain and electron doping across the interface result in the unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states. In sharp contrast, no charge transfer is observed for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/SrTiO$_3$(001). Surprisingly, tensile strain drives a metallization of the bonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, rendering a Fermi surface topology akin to superconducting bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under high pressure, yet with spin fluctuations enhanced considerably beyond pressure effects. Concomitantly, significant octahedral rotations are retained. We discuss the fundamental differences between hydrostatic pressure versus epitaxial strain and establish that strain provides a much stronger control over the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization. The results suggest epitaxial La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, particularly under tensile strain, as interesting system to provide novel insights into the physics of bilayer nickelates and possibly induce superconductivity without external pressure.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we report the superconductor-insulator transition in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ interfaces, with corresponding electronic structures revealed using synchrotron low-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray linear dichroism (XLD). In addition to the valence states of each element within the films determined by XAS, XLD at the O K edge pre-peak reveals hybridizations involving both 2p$_{z}$ and 2p$_{x}$/2p$_{y}$ orbitals, which are concomitantly suppressed upon oxygen loss. Intriguingly, such oxygen loss that eliminates superconductivity, induces a qualitative XLD change at the Ni L$_{2}$ edge, implying significant transformations among 3d$_{x^{2}}$ $_{-y^{2}}$ and 3d$_{z^{2}}$ energy bands near the Fermi level. Our findings establish an element- and orbital-resolved electronic framework for the origin of superconductivity.</p></details> | under review |

Accompanying the superconductivity and a correlated insulator phase is the Kondo-lattice-like phenomenology in transport properties. Here we consider how such phenomenology can develop when the combination of the active bands are topological. We advance a unique construction of compact molecular orbitals through a partial Wannierization that is symmetry preserving. The resulting Anderson lattice model provides the basis for a microscopic understanding of the experimental observation, including the involved energy scales.

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11763v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+13...</summary><p>11+13 pages, 7+14 figures</p></details> |

Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</p></details> |  |

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band's natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters; 7 + 9 pages, 4 + 6 figures</p></details> |

Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe and WSe$_2$ nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to $2.2\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for SnSe$_2$ and up to $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for WSe$_2$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic Schottky-barrier-height in high-symmetry 2D WSe$_2$: Momentum-space anisotropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11005v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is usually supposed that only low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit anisotropy, here we show that high-symmetry 2D semiconductors can show significant anisotropy in momentum space due to the band structure anisotropy in k-space. The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04131v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrupolar Excitons in MoSe$_2$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18040v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for platforms to generate and control exotic excitonic states has greatly benefited from the advent of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their heterostructures. Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript just accepted in Nature Communications.

| **[Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03361v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p></details> |  |

By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</p></details> |  |

When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures (Published version)</p></details> |

A comparative study is done with Cr adsorbed in defect-free and single vacancy defect graphene systems. Ab-initio calculations are performed with and without Van der Waals interaction to check the hydrogen storage efficiency. Efficiency is determined by calculating the binding energy of the system. The preferred range for binding energy for reversible hydrogen storage, as determined by the Department of Energy, US, is between 0.2-0.6 eV.

Earlier studies without trigonal warping have found discrete half-metal and quarter-metal states with full spin and/or valley polarization and complete depletion of some of the Fermi surfaces. We show that when trigonal warping terms are included in the dispersion, partially polarized states with large but non-complete polarization and with both majority and minority carriers present, emerge at small doping, as seen in the experimental data. We show the results when the intervalley and intravalley interactions are equal as well as when they are unequal.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A complimentary impedance spectroscopy biosensing method with graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02510v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method where a bioactive functional layer on an electrically conductive thin film with high sheet resistance can be effectively used for complementary electrochemical impedance spectroscopy biosensing. The functional layer's properties, such as double-layer capacitance and charge-transfer resistance, influence the complex impedance of the thin film in direct contact with the layer. These measurements can be performed using a simple low-frequency setup with a lock-in amplifier. When graphene is used as the resistive thin film, the signal may also include contributions from graphene's quantum capacitance, which is sensitive to charge transfer to and from the graphene. Unlike in traditional graphene biosensors, changes in electrolyte properties over time, such as those caused by the dissolution of ambient gases, do not significantly affect AC measurements. This technique supports biosensor miniaturization, ensures stable operation, and provides reliable biomarker detection with a high signal-to-noise ratio.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages; more clarifications, a footnote and new references added, version to appear in PLB</p></details> |
| **[An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02497v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an all-electrical setup for achieving valley polarization in graphene. The setup consists of a finite graphene sheet connected to normal metal electrodes on both sides, with the junctions aligned along the zigzag edges while the armchair edges remain free. Each normal metal has two terminals, and when a bias is applied at one terminal while keeping the other three grounded, valley polarization arises due to transverse momentum matching between graphene and the normal metal. The valley polarization is maximized when the Fermi wave vector of the normal metal is approximately half the separation between the $K$ and $K'$ valleys in graphene. We analyze the dependence of conductance and valley polarization on system parameters such as the width and length of the graphene sheet, as well as the chemical potentials of graphene and the normal metal. The conductance through graphene increases with its width, while an increase in length initially reduces the conductance before leading to oscillatory behavior due to Fabry-P\'erot interference. The valley polarization efficiency decreases with increasing graphene length due to inter-valley mixing from back-and-forth reflections within the graphene region. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of disorder in graphene and find that while conductance near the Dirac point increases with disorder strength due to enhanced density of states, valley polarization efficiency decreases due to intervalley scattering. Our results provide insights into controlling valley polarization in graphene-based devices for valleytronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 captioned figures</p></details> |

| **[Corrugation-dominated mechanical softening of defect-engineered graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05194v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\text{2D}$ of atomically clean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density in correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (< 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Magneto transport of pressure induced flatbands in large angle twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22920v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle ($\sim 1.1^\circ$), leading to strong electron correlations and emergent quantum phases such as superconductivity and correlated insulating states. However, beyond the magic angle, the band structure generally remains dispersive, diminishing interaction-driven phenomena. In this work, we explore the equivalence between pressure-induced flatbands and the magic-angle flatband in large-angle TBG by systematically analyzing the role of interlayer coupling modifications under perpendicular pressure. We show that pressure-induced flatbands exhibit spatial localization similar to magic-angle TBG, with charge density concentrated in the AA-stacked regions. Furthermore, the Hall conductivity and magneto-transport properties under an external magnetic field reveal that these pressure-induced flatbands share key signatures with the quantum Hall response of magic-angle TBG. The obtained Hofstadter spectrum shows four consistent low-energy gaps across all twist angles under pressure, which align with the calculated Hall conductivity plateaus. Our findings suggest that pressure offers an alternative pathway to engineer flat electronic bands and correlated states in TBG, extending the landscape of tunable moir\'e materials beyond the constraints of the magic angle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sub-nm Curvature Unlocks Exceptional Inherent Flexoelectricity in Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21996v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flexoelectricity arises from strain-gradient-induced polarization and is pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to structural deformations. This phenomenon approaches its limit in highly curved nanostructures, where extreme charge redistribution and electrostatic modulation result in macroscopic manifestations, such as electronic band offsets, that can be measured. Here, we present the first experimental and theoretical demonstration of giant intrinsic flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles. These nanowrinkles feature a consistent radius of curvature of ~5 {\AA} atop a flat MoS_{2} substrate, where strain gradients, mapped by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy, emerge from mismatched elastic properties between graphene and MoS_{2}. Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) reveals consistent flexoelectric currents over large-area, dense nanowrinkle networks. The observed asymmetric electromechanical behavior, characterized by a threshold potential ({\Phi}_{th}) of ~1 V, suggests an intrinsic energy barrier to activate a flexoelectric current. This threshold likely arises from combined band alignment effects and strain-induced polarization barriers, which modulate carrier transport at the wrinkle apex. Notably, this behavior aligns with our theoretical band offset predictions (~1.2 V), further supporting flexoelectric dipoles in modifying local electrostatic potential. This represents the strongest manifestations of flexoelectricity in nanostructures with intrinsic polarization densities 10^{5}-10^{7} times greater than meso/micro counterparts yielding P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}. This work establishes graphene nanowrinkles as a model system for exploring giant nanoscale flexoelectric effects and highlights their potential for strain-engineered nanoscale electronic and electromechanical devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 4 main figures, 11 supplementary figures</p></details> |

Optically probing and controlling them can reveal important information such as symmetry and dynamics, but have so far been challenging due to the small energy gap compared to optical wavelengths. Here, we report near infrared optical control of orbital magnetism and associated anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in a magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) on monolayer WSe$_2$ device. We show that the properties of the AHE, such as hysteresis and amplitude, can be controlled by light near integer moir\'e fillings, where spontaneous ferromagnetism exists. By modulating the light helicity, we observe periodic modulation of the transverse resistance in a wide range of fillings, indicating light induced orbital magnetization through a large inverse Faraday effect. At the transition between metallic and AHE regimes, we also reveal large and random switching of the Hall resistivity, which are attributed to optical control of percolating cluster of magnetic domains. Our results open the door to optical manipulation of correlation and topology in MATBG and related structures.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Electric conductivity in graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02279v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compare three models of graphene electric conductivity: a non-local Kubo model, a local model derived by Falkovsky, and finally, a non-local quantum field theory (QFT) polarization-based model. These models are supposed to provide consistent results since they are derived from the same Hamiltonian. While we confirm that the local model is a proper $\textbf{q}\to\textbf{0}$ limit of both the non-local Kubo and the non-local QFT model (once losses are added to this last model), we find hard inconsistencies in the non-local QFT model as derived and currently used in literature. In particular, in the genuine non-local region ($\textbf{q}\neq\textbf{0}$), the available QFT model shows an intrinsic non-physical plasma-like behavior for the interband transversal electric conductivity at low frequencies (even after introducing the unavoidable losses). The Kubo model, instead, shows the expected behavior, i.e., an almost constant electric conductivity as a function of frequency $\omega$ with a gap for frequencies $\hbar\omega<\sqrt{(\hbar v_F q)^{2}+4m^{2}}$. We show that the Kubo and QFT models can be expressed using an identical Polarization operator $\Pi_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$, but they employ different expressions for the electric conductivity $\sigma_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$. In particular, the Kubo model uses a standard regularized expression, a direct consequence of Ohm's Law and causality, as we rigorously re-derive. We show that, once the standard regularized expression for $\sigma_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$ is used in the QFT model, and losses are included, the Kubo and QFT model coincide, and all its anomalies naturally disappear. Our findings show the necessity to appropriately define and regularize the electric conductivity to connect it with the available QFT model.</p></details> | 33 pages, 3 figures |

A striking displacement-field-induced enhancement of the Land\'e g-factor is observed in the zeroth Landau level of the monolayer-like band, highlighting the role of strong electron-electron interactions. Additionally, we find a rich landscape of LL crossings in the Dirac gully region, accompanied by phase transitions between spin-, gully-, and valley-polarized LLs. These experimental observations are successfully modeled using calculations based on optimized tight-binding parameters. Furthermore, our results reveal significant particle-hole asymmetry in the sequence of LLs in the Dirac gullies, attributed to differing g-factor values for electrons and holes. This asymmetry underscores the limitations of non-interacting models in capturing the complexities of strongly correlated multiband systems. This work provides new insights into the interplay of symmetry-breaking mechanisms and strong correlations in Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene, advancing our understanding of quantum transport phenomena in multiband systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, comments/suggestions are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Mobility of single vacancies and adatoms in graphene at room temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20843v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mobility of structural defects, adatoms, and defect-adatom combinations in self-supporting graphene subjected to keV ion irradiation. In the first scenario, homogeneous irradiation using 20 keV Ar$^+$ ions at a dose of $3 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$ induces tensile strain of up to 0.8\%. This strain diminishes with increasing defect density at the dose of $5 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$, indicating a strain-relaxation mechanism. Contrary to the expected localized behavior, vacancies exhibit long-range interactions, contributing to global strain effects across the lattice. In the second scenario, by employing a nanopore mask, we spatially confined defect generation to periodically aligned circular regions surrounded by non-irradiated material, enabling direct observation of vacancy and adatom dynamics. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) reveals significant structural damage in areas adjacent to the irradiated regions, suggesting that single vacancies migrate over distances on the order of 100 nm from irradiated to non-irradiated zones even at room temperature. The build-up of lattice strain observed in this study may play a key role in lowering the migration barrier of single vacancies, thereby facilitating their diffusion into pristine lattice regions. Furthermore, the findings highlight the role of pre-existing surface contaminants in preserving lattice integrity through a self-healing mechanism, where adatom-induced lattice reconstruction mitigates defect-induced structural degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Broken symmetry states and Quantum Hall Ferromagnetism in decoupled twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20392v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) with large twist angle is a novel 2D bilayer system with strong interlayer Coulomb interactions, whilst suppressed interlayer carrier tunneling due to momentum mismatch between the Dirac cones of individual graphene layers. This interlayer decoherence disentangles the layer degree of freedom from spin-valley space. We demonstrate the role of charge screening effects in electronically decoupled TBLG that determines the Landau level (LL) crossings and multicomponent Quantum Hall (QH) effect resulting from combinations of broken symmetry states with spin and valley flavors of constituent layers.The N = 0 LL at zero filling factor is characterized by a field-induced Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to an ordered ground state, consistent with predictions of intervalley coherent state of Kekul\'e order. Pronounced hysteresis and electron-hole asymmetry observed in the QH regime suggests pinning of low-energy topological excitations, i.e., skyrmions with spin and valley textures, at charged defects in graphene channel.</p></details> |  |

By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helicoidal background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helicoidal pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helicoidal graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[The Many-Body Ground State Manifold of Flat Band Interacting Hamiltonian for Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20060v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At a magic relative twist angle, magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has an octet of flat bands that can host strong correlation physics when partially filled. A key theoretical discovery in MATBG is the existence of ferromagnetic Slater determinants as exact ground states of the corresponding flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. The FBI Hamiltonian describes the behavior of electrons that interact with each other in a high-dimensional space, and is constructed from the band structure of the non-interacting Bistritzer--MacDonald model at the chiral limit. A key property of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG is that it is frustration free and can be written as a sum of non-commuting terms. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the ground state manifold of the FBI Hamiltonian, proving that it is precisely the linear span of such ferromagnetic Slater determinants.</p></details> | 39 pages |
| **[Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02670v4)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Physical Review X which emphasizes: discrepancy between theoretical and experimental onsite U; emergent f-electron potential phenomenologically introduced to model the chemical potential resets; auxiliary rotor mean-field method to capture the normal state physics; and two temperature scales in the system due to two competing fixed points. 18+7 pages, 23+3 figures</p></details> |

The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16032v7)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions; Refs added; redesigned Fig.8</p></details> |

This splitting is caused by the inequivalency between boron and carbon atoms. To make use of the favorable electronic structure, we investigate the electronic structure of alkali-metal-intercalated BC$_3$, where intercalated atoms not only introduce the electron carriers but also suppress the interlayer coupling. We find that the interlayer transfer is effectively suppressed by potassium intercalation, by which the favorable electronic structure of monolayer BC$_3$ is kept. Finally, we perform model calculation with the onsite-energy offset, and verified that the strategy, introducing the splitting to the van Hove singularity, works well in general situations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

However, the potential of dissipative protocols remains unclear beyond certain commuting Hamiltonians. This work provides significant analytical and numerical insights into the power of dissipation for preparing the ground state of non-commuting Hamiltonians. For quasi-free dissipative dynamics, including certain 1D spin systems with boundary dissipation, our results reveal a new connection between the mixing time in trace distance and the spectral properties of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, leading to an explicit and sharp bound on the mixing time that scales polynomially with system size. For more general spin systems, we develop a tensor network-based algorithm for constructing the Lindblad jump operator and for simulating the dynamics. Using this algorithm, we demonstrate numerically that dissipative ground state preparation protocols can achieve rapid mixing for certain 1D local Hamiltonians under bulk dissipation, with a mixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. We then prove the rapid mixing result for certain weakly interacting spin and fermionic systems in arbitrary dimensions, extending recent results for high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers to the zero-temperature regime. Our theoretical approaches are applicable to systems with singular stationary states, and are thus expected to have applications beyond the specific systems considered in this study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite steady-state current defies non-Hermitian many-body localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02460v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Hermitian many-body localization (NH MBL) has emerged as a possible scenario for stable localization in open systems, as suggested by spectral indicators identifying a putative transition for finite system sizes. In this work, we shift the focus to dynamical probes, specifically the steady-state spin current, to investigate transport properties in a disordered, non-Hermitian XXZ spin chain. Through exact diagonalization for small systems and tensor-network methods for larger chains, we demonstrate that the steady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially with disorder strength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values far beyond the previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy between spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport behavior, which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of dynamical observables in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional spectral measures may not fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity of limits in system size and time, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size studies. These findings challenge the existence of NH MBL in the studied model and underscore the need for alternative approaches to understand localization in non-Hermitian settings.</p></details> |  |

We consider four representative models in detail: the domain-wall (DW) Fredrickson-Andersen (FA), the DW East, the ZZZ-FA, and the XOR-FA models. Using numerical tensor networks, we build the LD phase diagrams of these models in terms of the softness of the constraint and the counting field conjugate to the dynamical activity. In all cases, we find distinct dynamical phases separated by phase transitions along the self-dual lines, revealing the presence of multi-critical points that delimit first-order from continuous active-inactive transitions. We discuss connections to supersymmetry and possible extensions to higher spin and space dimensions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Charge and Spin Sharpening Transitions on Dynamical Quantum Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13894v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of monitored systems can exhibit a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) between entangling and disentangling phases, tuned by the measurement rate. When the dynamics obeys a continuous symmetry, the entangling phase further splits into a fuzzy phase and a sharp phase based on the scaling of fluctuations of the symmetry charge. While the sharpening transition for Abelian symmetries is well understood analytically, no such understanding exists for the non- Abelian case. In this work, building on a recent analytical solution of the MIPT on tree-like circuit architectures (where qubits are repatedly added or removed from the system in a recursive pattern), we study entanglement and sharpening transitions in monitored dynamical quantum trees obeying U (1) and SU (2) symmetries. The recursive structure of tree tensor networks enables powerful analytical and numerical methods to determine the phase diagrams in both cases. In the U (1) case, we analytically derive a Fisher-KPP-like differential equation that allows us to locate the critical point and identify its properties. We find that the entanglement/purification and sharpening transitions generically occur at distinct measurement rates. In the SU (2) case, we find that the fuzzy phase is generic, and a sharp phase is possible only in the limit of maximal measurement rate. In this limit, we analytically solve the boundaries separating the fuzzy and sharp phases, and find them to be in agreement with exact numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10527v4)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we use cryptographic tools related to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4 re...</summary><p>v4 removes a note included accidentally in v3</p></details> |

Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is `doubly tunable': one way by driving frequency, the other by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent $2n{+}1$. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Infinite Tensor Networks, Complementary Recovery and Type II Factors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00096v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We initiate a study of local operator algebras at the boundary of infinite tensor networks, using the mathematical theory of inductive limits. In particular, we consider tensor networks in which each layer acts as a quantum code with complementary recovery, a property that features prominently in the bulk-to-boundary maps intrinsic to holographic quantum error-correcting codes. In this case, we decompose the limiting Hilbert space and the algebras of observables in a way that keeps track of the entanglement in the network. As a specific example, we describe this inductive limit for the holographic HaPPY code model and relate its algebraic and error-correction features. We find that the local algebras in this model are given by the hyperfinite type II$_\infty$ factor. Next, we discuss other networks that build upon this framework and comment on a connection between type II factors and stabilizer circuits. We conclude with a discussion of MERA networks in which complementary recovery is broken. We argue that this breaking possibly permits a limiting type III von Neumann algebra, making them more suitable ans\"atze for approximating subregions of quantum field theories.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 + ...</summary><p>20 + 9 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |
| **[Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14034v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>funda...</summary><p>fundamental connection between MIPT and mixed state is highlighted (20 + 10 pages, 6 + 6 figures)</p></details> |

However, the stability of quantum spin liquids (QSL) against single ion anisotropy (SIA) in these materials and the global quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev model with finite SIA remain unclear. In this study, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to explore the quantum phase diagram of the generalized spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg (K-H) model accompanied with SIA $A_c$. In the $A_c=0$ limit, the spin-3/2 K-H model exhibits a quantum phase diagram similar to that of a spin-1/2 system, including two QSLs around antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kitaev models. For models with finite $A_c$, we map out the quantum phase diagram around two Kitaev points and observe distinct types of in-plane vortex orders developed from these two QSL phases. Interestingly, series of nearly degenerate vortex configurations are discovered in each vortex phases. Using linear spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that these vortex configurations can be understood as a consequence of the quantum correction on a continuous family of degenerate classical states.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages, 4 figures plus Supplemental Material</p></details> |
| **[Revealing quantum phase string effect in doped Mott-insulator: a tensor network state approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23851v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply the fermionic tensor network (TN) state method to understand the strongly correlated nature in a doped Mott insulator. We conduct a comparative study of the $\sigma t$-$J$ model, in which the no-double-occupancy constraint remains unchanged but the quantum phase string effect associated with doped holes is precisely switched off. Thus, the ground state of the $\sigma t$-$J$ model can serve as a well-controlled reference state of the standard $t$-$J$ model. In the absence of phase string, the spin long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is found to be essentially decoupled from the doped holes, and the latter contribute to a Fermi-liquid-like compressibility and a coherent single-particle propagation with a markedly reduced pairing tendency. In contrast, our TN calculations of the $t$-$J$ model indicate that the AFM order decreases much faster with doping and the single-particle propagation of doped holes gets substantially suppressed, concurrently with a much stronger charge compressibility at small doping and a significantly amplified Cooper pairing tendencies. These findings demonstrate that quantum many-body interference from phase strings plays a pivotal role in the $t$-$J$ model, mediating long-range entanglement between spin and charge degrees of freedom.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Learning out-of-time-ordered correlators with classical kernel methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01592v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs with classical computers is an expensive procedure. This is due to the need to classically simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails computational costs that scale rapidly with system size. Similarly, exact simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will either only be possible for short times with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, or will require a fault-tolerant QC which is currently beyond technological capabilities. This motivates a search for alternative approaches to determine OTOCs and related quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets of Hamiltonians describing local one-dimensional quantum systems of interest in condensed matter physics. For each set, we investigate whether classical kernel methods (KMs) can accurately learn the XZ-OTOC and a particular sum of OTOCs, as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We frame the problem as a regression task, generating small batches of labelled data with classical tensor network methods for quantum many-body systems with up to 40 qubits. Using this data, we train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe that the Laplacian and radial basis function (RBF) kernels perform best, achieving a coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) on the testing sets of at least 0.7167, with averages between 0.8112 and 0.9822 for the various sets of Hamiltonians, together with small root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Hence, after training, the models can replace further uses of tensor networks for calculating an OTOC function of a system within the parameterised sets. Accordingly, the proposed method can assist with extensive evaluations of an OTOC function.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 + ...</summary><p>19 + 18 pages, 6 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

DisCoCat diagrams can be associated with tensor networks and quantum circuits. DisCoCat diagrams have been connected to density matrices in various contexts in Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). Previous use of density matrices in QNLP entails modelling ambiguous words as probability distributions over more basic words (the word \texttt{queen}, e.g., might mean the reigning queen or the chess piece). In this article, we investigate using probability distributions over processes to account for syntactic ambiguity in sentences. The meanings of these sentences are represented by density matrices. We show how to create probability distributions on quantum circuits that represent the meanings of sentences and explain how this approach generalises tasks from the literature. We conduct an experiment to validate the proposed theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation of Fermionic circuits using Majorana Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18939v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Majorana Propagation, an algorithmic framework for the classical simulation of Fermionic circuits. Inspired by Pauli Propagation, Majorana Propagation operates by applying successive truncations throughout the Heisenberg evolution of the observable. We identify monomial length as an effective truncation strategy for typical, unstructured circuits by proving that high-length Majorana monomials are exponentially unlikely to contribute to expectation values and the backflow of high-length monomials to lower-length monomials is quadratically suppressed. Majorana Propagation can be used either independently, or in conjunction with quantum hardware, to simulate Fermionic systems relevant to quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We exemplify this by using Majorana Propagation to find circuits that approximate ground states for strongly correlated systems of up to 52 Fermionic modes. Our results indicate that Majorana Propagation is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art tensor-network-based circuit simulators.</p></details> |  |

Towards an open problem in algebraic complexity theory, we prove separations between the moment polytopes of matrix multiplication tensors and unit tensors. As a consequence, we find that matrix multiplication moment polytopes are not maximal, i.e. are strictly contained in the corresponding Kronecker polytope. As another consequence, we obtain a no-go result for a natural operational characterization of moment polytope inclusion in terms of asymptotic restriction. We generalize the separation and non-maximality to moment polytopes of iterated matrix multiplication tensors. Our result implies that tensor networks where multipartite entanglement structures beyond two-party entanglement are allowed can go beyond projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) in terms of expressivity. Our proof characterizes membership of uniform points in moment polytopes of tensors, and establishes a connection to polynomial multiplication tensors via the minrank of matrix subspaces. As a result of independent interest, we extend these techniques to obtain a new proof of the optimal border subrank bound for matrix multiplication.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we conduct a systematic numerical analysis of quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators described by the extended ($U$-$V$) Hubbard model. We discuss the applicability of the analytical formula for doublon-holon (DH) pair production, previously derived for the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which highlights the relationship between the tunneling threshold, the charge gap, and the correlation length. We test the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy increase rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the formula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states facilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$. However, when excitonic states emerge, the formula more accurately describes the rate of energy increase than the DH pair creation rate and in both cases gets improved by incorporating the exciton energy as the effective gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages including bibliography and the appendix (11 pages without them), 8 figures in the main text and 1 in the appendix for a total of 9 figures, and 2 tables in the main text</p></details> |

A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.</p></details> |  |

More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 6 pages, 5 figures.

The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$.

| **[Matrix product state fixed points of non-Hermitian transfer matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18733v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice. Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the boundary matrix product state calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published version. 13 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of three-level systems, or qutrits, useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate pulse gates to a low error rate to obtain transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy, and Tasaki) which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena such as topologically protected ground states, string order and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. We further present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase, and use tensor network simulations to establish the advantage of qutrit-based implementation over qubit-based ones in the presence of noise. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended discussion on Noisy simulation of Berry Phase estimation added</p></details> |

Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and \mbox{(de-)confinement}. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Supersolid phase in two-dimensional soft-core bosons at finite temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03482v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The supersolid phase of soft-core bosons in two dimensions is investigated using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock and quantum Monte Carlo methods. An approximate phase diagram at finite temperatures is initially constructed using the mean-field approach, which is subsequently validated through precise path-integral simulations, enabling a microscopic characterization of the various phases. Superfluid and melting/freezing transitions are analyzed through the superfluid density and the long-range behavior of correlation functions associated with positional and orientational order, in accordance with the general picture of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. A broad region at low temperatures is identified where the supersolid phase exists, separating the uniform superfluid phase from the normal quasi-crystal phase. Additionally, a potential intermediate hexatic phase with quasi long-range orientational order is identified in a narrow region between the normal solid and fluid phases. These findings establish self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory beyond the local density approximation as an effective tool, complementary to computationally intensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, for investigating the melting of the supersolid phase and the possible emergence of the hexatic superfluid phase in bosonic systems with various interaction potentials.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Self-bound monolayer crystals of ultracold polar molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02682v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the physics of ultracold dipolar molecules using path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and construct the complete phase diagram extending from weak to strong interactions and from small to mesoscopic particle numbers. Our calculations predict the formation of self-bound quantum droplets at interaction strengths lower than previously anticipated. For stronger interactions, the droplet continuously loses superfluidity as correlations develop, and is eventually found to undergo a transition to a crystalline monolayer that remains self-bound without external confinement. The spontaneous formation of such two-dimensional phases from a three-dimensional quantum gas is traced back to the peculiar anisotropic form of the dipole-dipole interaction generated by microwave-dressing of rotational molecular states. For sufficiently large particle numbers, crystallization takes place for comparably low interaction strengths that do not promote two-body bound states and should thus be observable in ongoing experiments without limitations from three-body recombination.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Single-Particle Dispersion and Density of States of the Half-Filled 2D Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02614v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementing an improved method for analytic continuation and working with imaginary-time correlation functions computed using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we resolve the single-particle dispersion relation and the density of states (DOS) of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasi-particle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states and the associated onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ scattering may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity in the cuprates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04681v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Observing Spatial Charge and Spin Correlations in a Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01885v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional correlated fermions constitute a cornerstone of quantum matter, covering a broad fundamental and technological scope, and have attracted increasing interest with the emergence of modern materials such as high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, graphene, topological insulators, and Moir\'e structures. Atom-based quantum simulators provide a new pathway to understand the microscopic mechanisms occurring at the heart of such systems. In this work, we explore two-dimensional attractive Fermi gases at the microscopic level by probing spatial charge and spin correlations in situ. Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal a marked dip in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Quantum Advantage for Multi-option Portfolio Pricing and Valuation Adjustments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04924v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical problem in the financial world deals with the management of risk, from regulatory risk to portfolio risk. Many such problems involve the analysis of securities modelled by complex dynamics that cannot be captured analytically, and hence rely on numerical techniques that simulate the stochastic nature of the underlying variables. These techniques may be computationally difficult or demanding. Hence, improving these methods offers a variety of opportunities for quantum algorithms. In this work, we study the problem of Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) which has significant importance in the valuation of derivative portfolios. As a variant, we also consider the problem of pricing a portfolio of many different financial options. We propose quantum algorithms that accelerate statistical sampling processes to approximate the price of the multi-option portfolio and the CVA under different measures of dispersion. Technically, our algorithms are based on enhancing the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms by Montanaro with an unbiased version of quantum amplitude estimation. We analyse the conditions under which we may employ these techniques and demonstrate the application of QMC techniques on CVA approximation when particular bounds for the variance of CVA are known.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Learning phases with Quantum Monte Carlo simulation cell](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23098v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new machine learning input data type, "spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised machine learning on two models, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions. Additionally, we conduct a regression task to predict superfluid density, which reflects non-local properties of the quantum system, and achieve good accuracy. These results validate the spin-opstring as an effective input for machine learning applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Quantum many-body simulation of finite-temperature systems with sampling a series expansion of a quantum imaginary-time evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07070v3)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating thermal-equilibrium properties at finite temperature is crucial for studying quantum many-body systems. Quantum computers are expected to enable us to simulate large systems at finite temperatures, overcoming challenges faced by classical computers, like the sign problem of the quantum Monte-Carlo technique. Conventional methods suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) devices are designed for studying large-scale quantum many-body systems but require a large number of ancilla qubits and a deep quantum circuit with many basic gates, making them unsuitable for the early stage of the FTQC era, at which the availability of qubits and quantum gates is limited. In this paper, we propose a method suitable for quantum devices in this early stage to calculate the thermal-equilibrium expectation value of an observable at finite temperatures. Our proposal, named the Markov-chain Monte Carlo with sampled pairs of unitaries (MCMC-SPU) algorithm, involves sampling simple quantum circuits and generating the corresponding statistical ensembles. This approach addresses the issues of resource demand and the decay in probability associated with postselection of measurement outcomes on ancilla qubits. We validate our proposal with numerical simulation on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model as an illustrative example.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Our key findings are: (1) Besides the expected hole to electron-like behavior change around half filling, we show that the additional sign change at an electronic density $n_s$ (and correspondingly a hole density $p_s$) is controlled by the opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states or compressibility and not by the pseudogap scale in the single particle density of states. (2) We find that $n_s(T,U)$ depends strongly on the interaction $U$ and shows an unusual non-monotonic dependence on temperature with a maximum at a temperature $T\approx t$, on the order of the hopping scale. (3) We identify local moment formation close to half filling as the main driver for the anomalous behavior of the thermoelectric transport coefficient.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876v4)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Most topological orders forbid sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo: Nonpositive Gauss sum as an indicator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21925v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body physics, yet its efficacy is often curtailed by the notorious sign problem. In this Letter, we introduce a novel criterion for the "intrinsic" sign problem in two-dimensional bosonic topological orders, which cannot be resolved by local basis transformations or adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we show that a nonpositive higher Gauss sum for a given topological order indicates the presence of an intrinsic sign problem. This condition not only aligns with prior findings but significantly broadens their scope. Using this new criterion, we examine the Gauss sums of all 405 bosonic topological orders classified up to rank 12, and strikingly find that 398 of them exhibit intrinsic sign problems. We also uncover intriguing links between the intrinsic sign problem, gappability of boundary theories, and time-reversal symmetry, suggesting that sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo may fundamentally rely on both time-reversal symmetry and gapped boundaries. These results highlight the deep connection between the intrinsic sign problem and fundamental properties of topological phases, offering valuable insights into their classical simulability.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, supplementary information available</p></details> |
| **[Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum and restore entanglement Hamiltonian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16709v7)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reduced density matrix (RDM) plays a key role in quantum entanglement and measurement, as it allows the extraction of almost all physical quantities related to the reduced degrees of freedom. However, restricted by the degrees of freedom in the environment, the total system size is often limited, let alone the subsystem. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum Monte Carlo scheme with a low technical barrier, enabling precise extraction of the RDM. To demonstrate the power of the method, we present the fine levels of the entanglement spectrum (ES), which is the logarithmic eigenvalues of the RDM. We clearly show the ES for a $1$D ladder with a long entangled boundary, and that for the $2$D Heisenberg model with a tower of states. Furthermore, we put forward an efficient way to restore the entanglement Hamiltonian in operator-form from the sampled RDM data. Our simulation results, utilizing unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish a practical computational framework for determining entanglement quantities based on the RDM, such as the ES, particularly in scenarios where the environment has a huge number of degrees of freedom.</p></details> |  |

Our approach formulates the Dyson equation as a constrained optimization problem with a simple quadratic objective. The constraints on the self-energy are obtained via direct measurement of the leading order terms of its asymptotic expansion within a continuous time quantum Monte Carlo framework, and the use of the compact discrete Lehmann representation of the self-energy yields an optimization problem in a modest number of unknowns. We benchmark our method for the non-interacting Bethe lattice, as well as DMFT calculations for both model systems and ab-initio applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Our results provide evidence of liquid-like behavior and partial isotopic separation in a cluster of 640 molecules, at temperature T=10 K. As the temperature is lowered below ~ 6 K, crystallization occurs, with no indication that the liquid phase is more resilient at low temperature in a mixed cluster. Isotopic separation is therefore predicted to take place at low temperature only through the slow process of molecular self-diffusion in a crystalline matrix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repla...</summary><p>Replaced with published version</p></details> |

By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-equivalent DSSF closely matches Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for kBT/J ~ 1, capturing the continuum of magnetic excitations observed in neutron scattering measurements. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions by De Gennes, where the pinched-oval spectral continuum reflects the uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Surprisingly, entanglement witnesses extracted from the quantum-equivalent DSSF mimic quantum calculations across all temperatures, despite relying on classical dynamics. However, classical simulations fail to reproduce higher energy spectral weight from spinon excitations at lower temperatures and struggle to explain the system behavior at intermediate temperatures and magnetic fields. Our approach highlights the potential of classical dynamics to emulate quantum effects even in the most extreme spin systems, with implications for future experimental and theoretical investigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, and supplementary information; comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Magnetic excitations in a trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19716v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the first-order perturbation theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[First- and second-order quantum phase transitions in the long-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02165v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the ground-state phase diagram of an unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse fields in the full range of interactions: from all-to-all to nearest-neighbors. First, we solve the model analytically in the strong long-range regime, confirming in the process that a mean-field treatment is exact for this model. We compute the order parameter and the correlations and show that the model exhibits a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from first to second order. This is in contrast with the nearest-neighbor limit where the phase transition is known to be second order. To understand how the order of the phase transition changes from one limit to the other, we tackle the analytically-intractable interaction ranges numerically, using a variational quantum Monte Carlo method with a neural-network-based ansatz, the visual transformer. We show how the first-order phase transition shrinks with decreasing interaction range and establish approximate boundaries in the interaction range for which the first-order phase transition is present. Finally, we establish that the key ingredient to stabilize a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point is the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between spins of the same sublattice on top of antiferromagnetic interactions between spins of different sublattices. Tunable-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic interactions are just one way to implement such staggered interactions.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01384v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among present quantum many-body computational methods, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale complex systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding quantum many-body physics. However, two dark clouds, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.</p></details> | 18 pages,18 figures |
| **[Geometric Breaking of Quantum Strings in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21135v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of string breaking are observed across various quantum simulation platforms \cite{Rydberg_kagome,qbit_string_breaking}. However, the strings can only be broken by quenching the tension energy due to the system size limitation, such "tensile breaking" behaves quite the same as in one-dimension \cite{ion_string_breaking}. To discover the distinctive properties of quantum strings in two dimensions, we utilize a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method to simulate a ten times larger scale (743-site) Kagome Rydberg atom array which can be described with U(1) lattice gauge theory. With designed edges, one end of the string can be easily grasped, allowing for clearly observing the dynamics of the dangling gauge charge at the open end. Then, we can drag each end in opposite directions perpendicular to the string. As the separation distance increases, asymptotic freedom-like behavior is detected. Eventually, the string breaks because the distance between both ends surpasses the string's length, so named "geometric breaking". Distinct from "tensile breaking," the two newly formed strings are suddenly uncorrelated, accompanied by a sudden energy increase. Lastly, we study multiple strings and successfully prepare a heart-like superposition state of broken and unbroken quantum strings with three gauge charges attached reminiscent of quarks and gluon. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, new version focus more on the string breaking, comments are welcome, and more information at http://cqutp.org/users/xfzhang/</p></details> |

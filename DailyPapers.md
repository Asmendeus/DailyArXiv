| **[Methods to achieve near-millisecond energy relaxation and dephasing times for a superconducting transmon qubit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18778v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting qubits are one of the most promising physical systems for implementing quantum computers. However, executing quantum algorithms of practical computational advantage requires further improvements in the fidelities of qubit operations, which are currently limited by the energy relaxation and dephasing times of the qubits. Here, we report our measurement results of a high-coherence transmon qubit with energy relaxation and echo dephasing times surpassing those in the existing literature. We measure a qubit frequency of 2.9 GHz, an energy relaxation time with a median of 425 us and a maximum of (666 +/- 33) us, and an echo dephasing time with a median of 541 us and a maximum of (1057 +/- 138) us. We report in detail our design, fabrication process, and measurement setup to facilitate the reproduction and wide adoption of high-coherence transmon qubits in the academia and industry.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Observation of superconducting pair density modulation within lattice unit cell](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16683v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the pair density wave state, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially periodic order parameter modulations with the period of several unit cells and translational symmetry breaking, has attracted broad attention. However, the superconducting pair density modulation within a single unit cell (PDM) has never been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of PDM in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001). The superconductivity modulations are characterized by the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness. Further analysis shows that the local maxima and minima in the superconducting gap modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the chalcogen atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the chalcogen atoms in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our findings provide precise microscopic information on superconductivity within the lattice unit cell and may promote the understanding of unconventional high-Tc superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ternary superhydrides under pressure of Anderson's theorem: Near-record superconductivity in (La,Sc)H$_{12}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07477v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lanthanum-hydrogen system and its derivatives remain among the most promising for achieving room-temperature superconductivity. In this study, we examined the formation of ternary lanthanum-scandium superhydrides at pressures up to 220 GPa. The primary product of the LaSc alloy's reaction with hydrogen is newly discovered cubic (La,Sc)H$_{12}$, demonstrating clear superconducting transition in all six channels of the van der Pauw scheme below 244-248 K. In this compound with an unusually large unit cell volume, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed in fields up to 68 Tesla. Synthesized samples of (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ demonstrate pronounced superconducting diode and SQUID-like effects at a record high temperature of 233 K. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the formation of lower hexagonal polyhydrides (La,Sc)H$_{6-7}$, which could potentially account for the anomaly in electrical resistance observed near 274 K. This anomaly between 265-290 K also appears in the radio-frequency transmission measurements and may be of a superconducting nature.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the new version we have added radio-frequency measurements (Figure 5), as well as a number of additional figures in the Supp. Info</p></details> |
| **[Identification of the superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ upon 100 GPa](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11369v3)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identification of superconductivity in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases of nickelates under high pressure remains challenging. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistance, and Meissner effect in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with hydrostatic pressures up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase above 40 GPa. Zero resistance of the superconductivity was achieved with a maximum onset $T_c^{onset}$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed until it disappears above 80 GPa, resulting in a right-triangle-like superconducting region. The direct-current magnetic susceptibility technique successfully detected the Meissner effect in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure; the maximum superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be 62.7% at 22.0 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals under high pressure. The results reveal intimate connections among the superconductivity, oxygen content, and structure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a renewed version with Meissner effect measurements</p></details> |
| **[Self-consistent study of topological superconductivity in two-dimensional quasicrystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06355v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study two-dimensional $s$-wave topological superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field in Penrose and Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently for not only the superconducting order parameter, but also the spin-dependent Hartree potential, we show the stable occurrence of topological superconductivity with broken time-reversal symmetry in both Penrose and Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals. The topological nature of the quasicrystalline system is signified by the Bott index $B$. Topological phase transitions are found to occur, where $B$ changes between 0 and $\pm 1$, as the chemical potential or Zeeman field is varied. In terms of self-consistent solutions, we demonstrate the existence of a Majorana zero mode per edge or vortex when $B=\pm 1$, consistently with the bulk-edge/defect correspondence for periodic systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Flat-band ratio and quantum metric in the superconductivity of modified Lieb lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12993v3)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the bands as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are calculated within dynamical mean-field theory. We find that for isolated flat bands, the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are in general good indicators of superconductivity even at finite temperatures. For non-isolated flat bands, a good guideline of the BKT temperature is provided by the zero-temperature superfluid weight and the flat-band ratio.</p></details> | Journal version |
| **[Detecting a Fifth-Force Gauge Boson via Superconducting Josephson Junctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14514v3)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new fifth force between particles carrying $B-L$ charges is well-motivated by the intriguing $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the standard model. The gauge boson mediator, F\'eeton, also serves as a dark matter candidate. In this letter, we propose a novel experimental design to detect the quantum phase difference caused by this fifth force using a superconducting Josephson junction. We find that the experiment has the best sensitivity to the gauge coupling when the gauge boson is within the mass range of $0.01\,$eV to $10\,$eV, which is an interesting mass region for the F\'eeton dark matter. This opens up a new avenue for the measurement of new physics at small scale below millimeter.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Impact of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09906v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has played an important role in many topological and correlated electron materials. In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) at proximity was shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG). We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with Tc = 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase and observed the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is significantly enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD - opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages; 4 figures, 1 table, 9 extended data figures; Nature Materials (2025, in press)</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17709v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Direct Implementation of High-Fidelity Three-Qubit Gates for Superconducting Processor with Tunable Couplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18319v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-qubit gates can be constructed using combinations of single-qubit and two-qubit gates, making their independent realization unnecessary. However, direct implementation of three-qubit gates reduces the depth of quantum circuits, streamlines quantum programming, and facilitates efficient circuit optimization, thereby enhancing overall performance in quantum computation. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity scheme for implementing a three-qubit controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gate in a flip-chip superconducting quantum processor with tunable couplers. This direct CCZ gate is implemented by simultaneously leveraging two tunable couplers interspersed between three qubits to enable three-qubit interactions, achieving an average final state fidelity of $97.94\%$ and a process fidelity of $93.54\%$. This high fidelity cannot be achieved through a simple combination of single- and two-qubit gate sequences from processors with similar performance levels. Our experiments also verify that multi-layer direct implementation of the CCZ gate exhibits lower leakage compared to decomposed gate approaches. To further showcase the versatility of our approach, we construct a Toffoli gate by combining the CCZ gate with Hadamard gates. As a showcase, we utilize the CCZ gate as an oracle to implement the Grover search algorithm on three qubits, demonstrating high performance with the target probability amplitude significantly enhanced after two iterations. These results highlight the advantage of our approach, and facilitate the implementation of complex quantum circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main text: 8 pages, 4 figures; supp: 11 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Space-Time-Coupled Qubits for Enhanced Superconducting Quantum Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16872v3)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279v4)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems leading to a universal description of the nature of information dynamics.</p></details> | 6 figures, 26 pages |
| **[Conditions for orbital-selective altermagnetism in Sr2RuO4: tight-binding model, similarities with cuprates, and implications for superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14378v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vibrational modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ easily induce octahedral rotations without tilting. Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Chiral cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonlinearities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17924v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time reversal symmetry breaking is an important piece in controlling nonreciprocal responses which are crucial in advancing the utility of quantum materials in device operations. Here, we propose cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson junction devices. The cavity control of superconducting nonreciprocities offers non-invasive means of exploring new functionalities in quantum circuits with in-situ implementation. This can serve as an important contribution to the toolbox for nonreciprocal models in circuit quantum electrodynamics to be harnessed for quantum computing and sensing.</p></details> |  |

| **[Charge fluctuations, hydrodynamics and transport in the square-lattice Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04047v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling, we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the strong-coupling regimes.</p></details> | 27 pages, 23 figures |
| **[On the mean-field antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled 2D Hubbard model at zero temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18141v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model (on a square lattice) at zero temperature in Hartree-Fock theory. It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U>0$ and $t>0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Machine learning Hubbard parameters with equivariant neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02457v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$) provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine-learning semi-local exchange-correlation functionals for Kohn-Sham density functional theory of the Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16893v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hubbard model provides a test bed to investigate the complex behaviour arising from electron-electron interaction in strongly-correlated systems and naturally emerges as the foundation model for lattice density functional theory (DFT). Similarly to conventional DFT, lattice DFT computes the ground-state energy of a given Hubbard model, by minimising a universal energy functional of the on-site occupations. Here we use machine learning to construct a class of scalable `semi-local' exchange-correlation functionals with an arbitrary degree of non-locality for the one-dimensional spinfull Hubbard model. Then, by functional derivative we construct an associated Kohn-Sham potential, that is used to solve the associated Kohn-Sham equations. After having investigated how the accuracy of the semi-local approximation depends on the degree of non-locality, we use our Kohn-Sham scheme to compute the polarizability of linear chains, either homogeneous or disordered, approaching the thermodynamic limit. approaching the thermodynamic limit.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Eigenstate solutions of the Fermi-Hubbard model via symmetry-enhanced variational quantum eigensolver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15903v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is an important tool for effective quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Comparison of superconducting pairing in doped cuprates and nickelates within an extended Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08717v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within a Hubbard model, we investigate the superconducting pairing behavior of infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{NdNiO_2}$ and cuprate superconductors by using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method. Our focus is on comparing their dominant pairing symmetries. The results indicate that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is significantly enhanced at low temperatures in both doped nickelates and cuprates, whereas other typical pairing symmetries are effectively suppressed, highlighting the dominance of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing form. Additionally, we find that the effective pairing interaction for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing in doped nickelates is slightly lower than that in doped cuprates, which may be attributed to the different degrees of Fermi surface warping caused by the third-nearest hopping $t''$. Further studies show that the hole doping and interaction strength have significant effects on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction within the selected parameter range. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is notably weakened when the hole doping increases, whereas it is significantly enhanced with increasing Coulomb interaction strength $U$. This comparative analysis reveals the similarities and differences in the pairing behaviors of doped nickelates and cuprates, which may provide further insights into understanding the superconducting properties of these two classes of materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages and 12 figures.

| **[The significance of "stripes" in the physics of the cuprates, the Hubbard model, and other highly correlated electronic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15709v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>"Stripes" - meaning unidirectional charge-density-waves, sometimes (but not always) accompanied by spin-density-waves with twice the period - are now known to arise in broad swathes of the cuprate phase diagram, and appear as a strong ordering tendency in numerical studies of Hubbard-like models of highly correlated electron systems. Jan Zaanen's work played a seminal role in predicting their existence, and exploring their possible significance. They are {\it not} related to any weak-coupling physics associated with some form of Fermi-surface nesting. And whether one likes them or not, they are surprisingly difficult to avoid; in the Hubbard model, for example, they often appear as an alternative order that can out-compete the otherwise favored $d$-wave superconductivity.</p></details> |  |

The Z2 Bose-Hubbard model has been proposed to describe ultracold bosons in a dynamical optical lattice. This model introduces the lattice degrees of freedom by placing half-spins on the bonds between neighboring lattice sites. In this study, we investigate the effect of spin fluctuations on the ground state by using the density-matrix renormalization group method. By calculating the spin structure factor and the compressibility, we show that there is a phase transition between two spatially nonuniform states.

In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.</p></details> |  |

We map out the phase diagram of interlayer hybridization versus density in the regime of intermediate to strong hybridization. In particular, we found that the sufficiently strong hybridization can destroy the $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing and induces its transition to correlated metallic, pseudogap, and Fermi liquid phases depending on the doping regime. The phase diagram hosted by the bilayer model implies its role as the versatile platform to explore the pressure effects on the two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover physics of Hubbard-type models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 30 figures.

This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which allows simulation of Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and provides a framework that enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model and the PPP model. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate Hubbard models on hexagonal lattice fragments and periodic hexagonal lattices, analyze gate costs, and provide commutator bounds for evaluating Trotter errors, including new commutator bounds for the extended Hubbard model. We compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, which we optimize for the hexagonal lattice Hubbard model, and demonstrate that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures |

However, recent theoretical studies suggest that it fails to reproduce a robust and homogeneous superconducting ground state. Here, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that magnetic excitations in the prototypical cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ are inconsistent with those of a simple Hubbard model. The magnetic response of hole carriers, contributing to an emergent branch of spin excitations, is strongly suppressed. This effect is the consequence of d-wave-like pairing, enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude through a large nearest-neighbor attractive interaction. The similarity between cuprate ladders and the two-dimensional compounds suggests that such an enhanced hole pairing may be a universal feature of superconducting cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main + SM: 21 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

Here, we report a constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) study of the square-lattice extended Hubbard model with on-site Coulomb repulsion U and nearest-neighbor (NN) electron attraction V. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.125, we find that the NN electron attraction V can notably drive an exotic spin-triplet (p-wave) superconducting (SC) phase, and enhance the p-wave SC correlations with the increase of V. But in the intermediate coupling regime, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (d-wave) does not significantly increase with the increase of V, indicating that the d-wave is not affected by V in strongly correlated system. Besides the pairing phase, a spin density wave (SDW) only exists near the half-filling in the particle-hole channel, and doping disrupts the formation of SDW order. Especially, the NN electron attraction V has no significant effect on SDW, reflecting the consistent relationship between d-wave SC and spin correlation. Moreover, as doping increases, the dominant region of p-wave also expands, further suppressing the presence of d-wave, which may help explain the disappearance of d-wave SC in overdoped cuprate superconductors. We also find the d-wave exhibits a singular nonzero (near point ($2{\pi}/3, {\pi}$)) condensation structure in momentum space, resulting in a different staggered behavior in the x and y direction with distance in real space. On the contrary, the p-wave condensed at zero momentum, and the p-wave correlation exhibits exponential decay in real space. Our work suggests the p-wave SC region can be induced and further broadened by the NN electron attraction V, offering a feasible mechanism to realize p-wave superconductivity in realistic cuprate materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures in the main text and 4 page, 4 figure in the supplemental material</p></details> |

Motivated by recent experimental studies that investigate the evolution of dynamical spin and charge responses, we analyze the spin and charge diffusion spectra in both half-filled and doped one-band Hubbard model using Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) combined with the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG). We compare the relative strengths and limitations of Density Matrix NRG (DMNRG) and Full Density Matrix NRG (FDM-NRG) in capturing low-frequency spectral features and their evolution with temperature, interaction strength and band-filling. Key measures, including characteristic frequency scales, Kullback-Leibler divergence, diffusion constants, and kurtosis provide complementary but internally consistent picture for the evolution of spin and charge excitations across bandwidth as well as the band-filling driven Mott transitions and the coherent-incoherent crossover. We find that spin and charge fluctuations cross over from quantum-coherent-to-quantum-incoherent at distinct temperatures, providing a microscopic insight into the complex, two-stage, Fermi-to-non-Fermi liquid-to-bad metal crossovers seen in transport data, in particular in the $dc$ resistivity.</p></details> |  |

| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, a new version with the supplemental material added</p></details> |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Zero resistance of the superconductivity was achieved with a maximum onset $T_c^{onset}$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed until it disappears above 80 GPa, resulting in a right-triangle-like superconducting region. The direct-current magnetic susceptibility technique successfully detected the Meissner effect in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure; the maximum superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be 62.7% at 22.0 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals under high pressure. The results reveal intimate connections among the superconductivity, oxygen content, and structure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a renewed version with Meissner effect measurements</p></details> |

To gain deeper insights into the distinct superconducting states, it is essential to unravel the nature of the density-wave states at ambient pressure, a topic that remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the direct visualization of an incommensurate unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in real space. The density of states (DOS) is strongly depleted near $E_F$, indicating the opening of a CDW gap of $2{\Delta} \approx 71$ meV, which is unfavorable for the formation of superconductivity at ambient pressure. We propose that the CDW arises from Fermi surface nesting, and is likely a subsidiary phase of a spin density wave. Compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the weaker electronic correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is likely one reason for the lower $T_c$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved-photo-emission-spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants and is insensitive to the c-axis one. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.1 p...</summary><p>4.1 pages, 5 figures with Appendix</p></details> |

Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and the potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector ${Q}\approx(0,\pm0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From the view of the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to ${Q}_0\approx\pm(0.58\pi,0.58\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by Fermi surfaces nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ much lower than that under high pressure. Further more, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC at AP.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The calculation details are improved and the format is modified</p></details> |

However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is $d_{xy}$, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged. Our work highlights the sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on low-energy electronic structure in multi-orbital superconductors, which calls for care in the downfolding procedure when one calculates their pairing symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

It is essential to search for high-temperature superconductivity in bulk samples and at ambient pressure in nickelates. In this study, we report influential factors that affect the appearance of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure. From direct-current magnetic measurements, we observe a clear diamagnetic response at 80 K in post-annealed single crystals of La3Ni2O7 in oxygen. The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be within 0.2%, resulting in a decrease in resistivity. This work presents a practical approach for further investigating high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | 4 figures, 11 pages |

Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Absence of superconductivity and density-wave transition in ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12647v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure stimulates intensive research interests. These nickelates crystallize in an orthogonal/monoclinic structure with tilted NiO$_6$ octahedra at ambient pressure and enter a density-wave-like phase at low temperatures. The application of pressure suppresses the octahedral tilting and triggers a transition to tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), which is believed to be a key prerequisite for the emergence of superconducting state. Here, by developing a high oxidative environment growth technology, we report the first tetragonal nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ microcrystals without octahedral tilting at ambient pressure. In tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, transport measurements find that both density-wave and superconducting transitions are absent up to 160 GPa, indicating a robust tetragonal metallic ground state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the band structure of ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ involves more $d_{z2}$ orbital contribution to the Fermi surface, compared to the monoclinic phase or the high-pressure superconducting tetragonal phase. The concurrent absence of density-wave state and high-pressure superconductivity in our ambient-pressure tetragonal crystals of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ suggests an underlying correlation between these two orders. It suggests that the tetragonal structure is not necessary, while the density-wave state is crucial for the superconductivity in nickelates. Our findings impose important constraints on the mechanism of pressure-induced superconductivity in nickelates and sheds new light on exploring ambient pressure high-temperature Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | submitted |

In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to the unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetic ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest the formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ simultaneously, thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, supplemental material</p></details> |

Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of heterointerfaces between 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and SrLaAlO$_4$ substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced oxygen 2p hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest pathways for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</p></details> | under review |

To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By analyzing the geometric average of the local density of states, we identify an Anderson localization transition occurring around $\delta \sim 0.2$.

Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 3 tables, 15 supplemental figures</p></details> |

Various theoretical approaches have been applied to the study of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, but lead to a number of contradicting results. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and at the same time particularly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as changes of the electronic structure through pressure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. Our work paves the way to understanding seemingly contradictory theoretical results within a unified framework.</p></details> |  |

Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</p></details> |  |

When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures (Published version)</p></details> |

In this work, we exploit the intense excitonic PL of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer combined with the high refractive index of bulk WS$_2$ to fabricate microdisk cavities with tunable light emission characteristics. These microdisks are created from a 50-nm-thick WS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ double heterostructure using frictional mechanical scanning probe lithography. The resulting cavities achieve a 4-10-fold enhancement in excitonic PL from the MoSe$_2$ monolayer at wavelengths near 800 nm. The excitonic PL peak is modulated by sharp spectral features, which correspond to whispering gallery modes (WGMs) supported by the cavity. A microdisk with a diameter of 2.35 $\mu$m demonstrates WGMs with a quality factor of up to 700, significantly surpassing theoretical predictions and suggesting strong potential for lasing applications. The spectral positions of the WGMs can be finely tuned by adjusting the microdisk's diameter and thickness, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. This approach offers a novel route for developing ultra-compact, all-TMDC double heterostructure light sources with record-small size.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures allow for tuning their electronic properties beyond their monolayer counterparts. We start by determining their electronic structure using density functional theory. We obtain the type-II band alignment and close in energy conduction band minima (valleys) at the $K$ and $Q$ points in the Brillouin zone. The valence band maxima, also energetically close, are located at the $K$ and $\Gamma$ points. By analyzing the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions, we describe the layer, spin, and orbital contributions. Next, we construct an \textit{ab initio}-based tight-binding model, which helps us to better understand the complexity of the interlayer interactions. We determine the effect of a vertical electric field, showing that vertical gating enables control of valleys extrema and their occupancy. Finally, we employ the tight-binding model to investigate laterally gated quantum dots and analyze the influence of a perpendicular electric field on their energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate that tuning the electric field enables control over the valley character of the quantum dot states, selectively localizing them in either the $K$ or $Q$ valleys, as evidenced by their characteristic degeneracies and wavefunctions.</p></details> |  |

In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporate the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir\'{e} unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferromagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Moreover, the hybridization of states from different layers and different valleys is allowed near the Fermi level. Those aspects are in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-gap superconductivity in a Janus MoSeLi monolayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08119v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) lithium-decorated materials have emerged as a significant area of study since the prediction of superconductivity in lithium-decorated graphene at temperatures around 8.1 K, with experimental evidence observed at Tc = 5.9 K. Following earlier studies, this paper focuses on the hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer as a promising candidate for Li-decorated 2D materials. Our research reveals that lithium substitution on a selenium layer of MoSe2 can produce a hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer, which exhibits metallic behavior with potential phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.5 K. Additionally, by solving the anisotropic gap equations derived from Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we found that the Janus MoSeLi monolayer exhibits two-gap superconductivity. This finding underscores the potential of hexagonal Janus MoSeLi as a significant Li-decorated 2D material for exploring two-dimensional superconductivity and sets the stage for further investigations into new families of Janus transition-metal chalcogenides.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Evolution of flat bands in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ moir lattices: A study combining machine learning and band unfolding methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07987v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moir\'e lattices have served as the ideal quantum simulation platform for exploring novel physics due to the flat electronic bands resulting from the long wavelength moir\'e potentials. However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir\'e patterns of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H-stacking at a twist angle of 3.89$^{\circ}$ without spin-orbit coupling effect. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15$^{\circ}$. Multiple ultra-flat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7$^{\circ}$. The spin-orbit coupling leads to a giant spin splitting comparable to that observed in the untwisted system (about 0.45 eV) and is nearly independent of twisting and stacking. As a result, the K-valley flat band remains the valence band maximum with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Band unfolding reveals that the ultra-flat bands formed by the $\Gamma$ and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The $\Gamma$-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by structural reconstruction. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13$^{\circ}$) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</p></details> |  |

So far, it is assumed that the atomic reconstruction appearing in some of the heterostructures gives rise to a dominating localization of the exciton states. We demonstrate that excitonic states in reconstructed MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures can extend well beyond the moir\'e periodicity of the investigated heterostructures. The results are based on real-space calculations yielding a lateral potential map for interlayer excitons within the strain-relaxed heterostructures and corresponding real-space excitonic wavefunctions. We combine the theoretical results with cryogenic photoluminescence experiments, which support the computed level structure and relaxation characteristics of the interlayer excitons.</p></details> |  |

Van der Waals heterostructures based on transition-metal dichalcogenides have been extensively studied because of potential optoelectronic applications. We investigate the optical response of a light-emitting tunneling structure based on a WSe\textsubscript{2} monolayer as an active emission material using the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) experiments performed at low temperature of 5~K. We found that the application of the bias voltage allows us to change both a sign and a value of free carriers concentrations. Consequently, we address the several excitonic complexes emerging in PL spectra under applied bias voltage. The EL signal was also detected and ascribed to the emission in a high-carrier-concentration regime. The results show that the excitation mechanisms in the PL and EL are different, resulting in various emissions in both types of experimental techniques.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

The experimental findings reveal details of interlayer charge transfer on ultrafast timescales, showing that the spin-valley polarized state of photoexcited carriers is conserved during the charge transfer and formation of interlayer excitons. Our results confirm that phonon scattering mediates the interlayer charge transfer process, while a high phonon population at elevated temperatures causes a significant decrease in spin-valley selective charge transfer. Moreover, the experimental findings demonstrate the possibility that interlayer excitons and their spin-valley polarization can be probed in the optical response of intralayer excitons. These findings pave the way for ultrafast detection, control, and manipulation of spin-valley polarized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D heterostructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultrafast light-driven optical rotation and hidden orders in bulk WSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06561v2)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-layer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, lacking point inversion symmetry, provide an efficient platform for valleytronics, where the electronic, magnetic, valley and lattice degrees of freedom can be selectively manipulated by using polarized light. This task is however thought to be limited in parent bulk compounds where the point inversion symmetry is restored. Exploiting the underlying quantum physics in bulk materials is thus one of the biggest paradigmatic challenges. Here we show that a sizable optical Kerr rotation can be efficiently generated in a wide energy range on ultrafast timescales in bulk WSe$_2$, by means of circularly-polarized light. We rationalize these findings as a result of the hidden spin/layer/valley quantum entanglement. The spectral analysis reveals clear features at the three characteristic frequencies corresponding to the A-, B- and C-exciton edges. The origin and the relative sign of all these features is shown to stem from the selective Pauli blocking of intralayer and interlayer optical transitions. The long lifetime of the broadband Kerr response ($\tau \sim 500$ fs) provides a strong indication that coupled photo-induced electron and hole densities survive in bulk compounds longer than previously expected. The present report demonstrates that a hidden quantum entanglement is operative also in bulk centrosymmetric layered materials, opening the way for an effective exploitation of bulk WSe$_2$ in optoelectronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+3 ...</summary><p>14+3 pages, 3+3 figures; fixed typo in the first author's name</p></details> |

In the equilibrium configuration, one of the O atoms is adsorbed on the vacancy and the other one atop one Se atom. Recombination of the CO molecule with the second of these O atoms to form CO$_2$ is a highly exothermic reaction, with an energy gain of around 3~eV. The likeliness of the CO oxidation reaction on this surface is next examined by calculating hundreds of AIMD trajectories for incidence energies that suffice to overcome the energy barriers in the entrance channel of the CO oxidative recombination. In spite of it, no CO$_2$ formation event is obtained. In most of the calculated trajectories the incoming CO molecule is directly reflected and in some cases, mainly at low energies, the molecules remain trapped at the surface but without reacting. As important conclusion, our AIMD simulations show that the recombination of CO molecules with adsorbed O atoms is a very unlikely reaction in this system, despite its large exothermicity.</p></details> |  |

In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) at proximity was shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG). We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with Tc = 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase and observed the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is significantly enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD - opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages; 4 figures, 1 table, 9 extended data figures; Nature Materials (2025, in press)</p></details> |

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the optical component of the displacement field, i.e., the relative motion of different sublattices, contributes at equal order as the acoustic component and effectively screens the pseudogauge fields. In particular, we consider twisted bilayer graphene and corrugated monolayer graphene. In both cases, optical lattice displacements significantly reduce the overall magnitude of the pseudomagnetic fields. For corrugated graphene, optical contributions also reshape the pseudomagnetic field and significantly modify the electronic bands near charge neutrality. Previous studies based on continuum elasticity, which ignores this effect, have therefore systematically overestimated the strength of the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field. Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of experiments and design of straintronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 + 1...</summary><p>7 + 15 pages, 4 + 12 figures</p></details> |

By construction of topological flat band with moire engineering, intrinsic FCIs have been observed in twisted MoTe2 system and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices with anomalous Hall resistivity quantization number C <= 2/3 including the gapless composite Fermi-liquid state with C = 1/2. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new system of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG)/hBN moire superlattices, which exhibit both integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects with rich tunability including electric displacement field, perpendicular magnetic field and in-plane magnetic field. By tuning the electrical and magnetic fields at 0 < v < 1, we have observed a quantum phase transition showing a sign reversal of the Hall resistivity at finite magnetic fields. Surprisingly, the FCI state at v = 2/3 survives in the phase transitions, exhibiting a robust quantized Hall resistivity across both phases. Finally we have further demonstrated the indispensable role moire potential plays in the formation of the flat Chern band from a theoretical perspective. Our work has established RHG/hBN moire superlattices as a promising platform for exploring quasi-particles with fractional charge and non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field.</p></details> |  |

One particularly puzzling observation is the transition between the EQAH and FCI regimes, driven either by temperature or electrical current. Here we propose a scenario to understand these transitions based on the topologically protected gapless edge modes that are present in both the FCI and EQAH phases and should be most relevant at temperature scales below the energy gap. Our consideration is based on the simple assumption that the edge velocity in FCI is smaller than that in EQAHE and thus contributes to a higher entropy. We further argue that domains with opposite fractionally quantized Hall conductance are ubiquitous in the devices due to disorder, which gives rise to a network of edge modes. The velocity of the edge modes between domains is further reduced due to edge reconstruction. The edge velocity can also be reduced by current when the occupation of the edge mode approaches the gap edge. The edge entropy therefore drives the transition from EQAH to FCI either by temperature or current at a nonzero temperature.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, typos fixed and reference updated, published in PRB as an Editors' Suggestion</p></details> |
| **[Magnetism and hidden quantum geometry in charge neutral twisted trilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18491v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here we present a theory of mirror-symmetric magic angle twisted trilayer graphene. The electronic properties are described by a Hubbard model with long range tunneling matrix elements. The electronic properties are obtained by solving the mean field Hubbard model. We obtain the bandstructure with characteristic flat bands and a Dirac cone. At charge neutrality, turning on electron-electron interactions results in metallic to antiferomagnetic phase transition, for Hubbard interaction strength considerably smaller than in other graphene multilayers. We analyze the stability of the antiferromagnetic state against the symmetry breaking induced by hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation, and mirror symmetry breaking caused by the application of electric fields that mix the Dirac cone with the flat bands. Additionally, we explore the topological properties of the system, revealing a hidden quantum geometry. Despite the flat bands having zero Chern numbers, the multiband Berry curvature distribution over the moir\'e Brillouin zone exhibits a non-trivial structure. Finally, we propose a mechanism to tune this quantum geometry, providing a pathway to control the system's topological properties.</p></details> |  |

Using the Floquet approach and the Dirac equation, we derive the energy spectrum solutions. The scattering coefficients are calculated explicitly by matching the eigenspinors at the GQD interfaces, revealing a dependence on several physical parameters. In addition, we compute the scattering efficiency, the electron density distribution, and the lifetime of the quasi-bound states. Our numerical results show that the presence of an energy gap and circularly polarized laser irradiation enhances the localization of the electron density within the GQDs, leading to an increase in the lifetime of the quasi-bound states. In particular, the intensity and polarization of the light influence the scattering process, allowing the manipulation of the electron confinement state. These results highlight the importance of combining magnetic fields and polarized light to control electronic transport in graphene nanostructures.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02670v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor changes to a substantially updated version that emphasizes: discrepancy between theoretical and experimental onsite U; emergent f-electron potential phenomenologically introduced to model the chemical potential resets; auxiliary rotor mean-field method to capture the normal state physics; and two temperature scales in the system due to two competing fixed points. 18+7 pages, 23+3 figures</p></details> |

The adhesion potential between graphene and hBN is calculated as a function of local lattice offset using diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods, which provide an accurate treatment of van der Waals interactions. Combining the adhesion potential with elasticity theory, we determine the relaxed structures of graphene and hBN layers at interfaces, finding no metastable structures. The adhesion potential is well described by simple Lennard-Jones pair potentials that we parameterize using our quantum Monte Carlo data. Encapsulation of graphene between near-aligned crystals of hBN gives rise to a moir\'{e} pattern whose period is determined by the misalignment angle between the hBN crystals superimposed over the moir\'{e} superlattice previously studied in graphene on an hBN substrate. We model minibands in such supermoir\'{e} superlattices and find them to be sensitive to a 180$^\circ$ rotation of one of the encapsulating hBN crystals. We find that monolayer and bilayer graphene placed on a bulk hBN substrate and bulk hBN/graphene/bulk hBN systems do not relax to adopt a common lattice constant. The energetic balance is much closer for free-standing monolayer graphene/hBN bilayers and hBN/graphene/hBN trilayers. The layers in an alternating stack of graphene and hBN are predicted to strain to adopt a common lattice constant and hence we obtain a new, stable three-dimensional crystal with a unique electronic structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graphene-Assisted Chemical Stabilization of Liquid Metal Nano Droplets for Liquid Metal Based Energy Storage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16128v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy storage devices with liquid_metal electrodes have attracted interest in recent years due to their potential for mechanical resilience, self_healing, dendrite_free operation, and fast reaction kinetics. Gallium alloys like Eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) are appealing due to their low melting point and high theoretical specific capacity. However, EGaIn electrodes are unstable in highly alkaline electrolytes due to Gallium oxide dissolution. In this letter, this bottleneck is addressed by introducing chemically stable films in which nanoscale droplets of EGaIn are coated with trace amounts of graphene oxide (GO). It is demonstrated that a GO to EGaIn weight ratio as low as 0.01 provides enough protection for a thin film formed by GO EGaIn nanocomposite against significantly acidic or alkaline environments (pH 1-14). It is shown that GO coating significantly enhances the surface stability in such environments, thus improving the energy storage capacity by over 10x. Microstructural analysis confirms GO EGaIn composite stability and enhanced electrochemical performance. Utilizing this, a thin film supercapacitor is fabricated. Results indicate that when coating the EGaIn with GO to EGaIn ratio of 0.001 the areal capacitance improves by 10 times, reaching 20.02 mF cm_2. This breakthrough paves the way for advanced liquid metal-based thin film electrodes, promising significant improvements in energy storage applications.</p></details> |  |

The superconducting region is characterized by a common $s$-wave superconductor closely proximitized to the MATBG. We compute various thermoelectric coefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of merit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further supported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping and valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a significant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching values as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting correlation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in this regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory behavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when an insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction. Beyond theoretical insights, our findings suggest new possibilities for thermoelectric applications using MATBG based NS junctions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Pa...</summary><p>12 Pages, 7 PDF Figures, Comments are welcome</p></details> |

In this work, we use exact diagonalization to go beyond the ultra-short range to find the different phases for $\nu=2/3$. We model the interaction as Yukawa so that we can control the range as a proof of concept. Even in this simple setting, we discovered how dropping the USR condition shifts the transition borders in favour of certain phases, leads to a new bond-ordered phase appearing, and breaks the ferromagnetic phase in two competing states as a result of lifting the USR-driven degeneracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages and 6 figures 1 table</p></details> |

Bound states induced by Coulomb impurity in the gap turn into atomic collapse resonances as the charge increases beyond the supercritical charge $Z_c$. $Z_c$ increases sublinear with the band gap $\Delta$. The atomic collapse resonances result in peaks in the LDOS at the same energies in $K$ and $K'$ valley, but the strong (weak) LDOS peaks in $K$ valley are weak (strong) LDOS peaks in $K'$ valley reminiscent of pseudospin polarization phenomenon. From a spatial LDOS analysis of the atomic collapse resonance states, we assign specific atomic orbitals to the atomic collapse resonances. Remarkably, the two $p$ atomic orbital atomic collapse states are no longer degenerate and splits into two having lobes in different directions in the graphene plane.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlocal Moments in the Chern Bands of Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16761v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has elements in common with two paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated physics: quantum Hall physics and Hubbard physics. On one hand, TBG hosts flat topological Landau-level-like bands which exhibits quantum anomalous Hall effects. On the other hand, these bands have concentrated charge density and show signs of extensive entropy resembling local moments. The combination of these features leads to a question: can decoupled moments emerge in an isolated topological band, despite the lack of exponentially localized Wannier states? In this work, we answer the question affirmatively by proposing a minimal model for these bands in TBG that combines topology and charge concentration at the AA sites, leading to analytic wavefunctions that closely approximate those of the BM model with realistic parameters. Importantly, charge concentration also leads to Berry curvature concentration at $\Gamma$, generating a small parameter $s$ that yields analytic tractability. We show that, rather surprisingly, the model hosts nearly decoupled flavor moments without any extra degrees of freedom. These moments are non-local due to topology-enforced power-law tails, yet have parametrically small overlap. We further develop a diagrammatic expansion in which the self energy can be computed exactly to leading order in $s^2$ in the fluctuating moment regime. At charge neutrality, we find a "Mott semimetal", with large flavor entropy and a Mott gap everywhere in the BZ except for the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point.

Equipped with gate electrodes, it has been demonstrated that these exceptional device properties can be electrically manipulated, leading to a variety of nanomechanical/acoustic applications. Here, we review the recent progress of graphene nanomechanical resonators with a focus on their electrical tunability. First, we provide an overview of different graphene nanomechanical resonators, including their device structures, fabrication methods, and measurement setups. Then, the key mechanical properties of these devices, for example, resonant frequencies, nonlinearities, dissipations, and mode coupling mechanisms, are discussed, with their behaviors upon electrical gating being highlighted. After that, various potential classical/quantum applications based on these graphene nanomechanical resonators are reviewed. Finally, we briefly discuss challenges and opportunities in this field to offer future prospects of the ongoing studies on graphene nanomechanical resonators.</p></details> | Invited review |

Nonetheless, there is still a need to simulate large quantum systems classically, as the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are yet to be considered fault tolerant and performant enough in terms of operations per second. Each of the two main exact simulation techniques, state vector and tensor network simulators, boasts specific limitations. The exponential memory requirement of state vector simulation, when compared to the qubit register sizes of currently available quantum computers, quickly saturates the capacity of the top HPC machines currently available. Tensor network contraction approaches, which encode quantum circuits into tensor networks and then contract them over an output bit string to obtain its probability amplitude, still fall short of the inherent complexity of finding an optimal contraction path, which maps to a max-cut problem on a dense mesh, a notably NP-hard problem. This article aims at investigating the limits of current state-of-the-art simulation techniques on a test bench made of eight widely used quantum subroutines, each in 31 different configurations, with special emphasis on performance. We then correlate the performance measures of the simulators with the metrics that characterise the benchmark circuits, identifying the main reasons behind the observed performance trend. From our observations, given the structure of a quantum circuit and the number of qubits, we highlight how to select the best simulation strategy, obtaining a speedup of up to an order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Material simulations are essential computational tools extensively used in both academic research and industrial applications. TNs, originally developed in quantum mechanics, have recently shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their potential for exponential speedups over classical algorithms. Our study successfully employs TNs to solve linear elasticity equations with billions of degrees of freedom, achieving exponential reductions in both memory usage and computational time. These results demonstrate the practical viability of TNs as a powerful classical backend for executing quantum-inspired algorithms with significant efficiency gains. This work is based on our research conducted with IKERLAN.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Tensor Network Finite-Size Scaling for Two-Dimensional 3-state Clock Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14002v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We benchmark recently proposed tensor network based finite-size scaling analysis in Phys. Rev. B {\bf 107}, 205123 (2023) against two-dimensional classical 3-state clock model. Due to the higher complexity of the model, more complicated crossover behavior is observed. We advocate that the crossover behavior can be understood from the perspective of finite bond dimension inducing relevant perturbation. This leads to a general strategy to best estimate the critical properties for a given set of control parameters. For the critical temperature $T_c$, the relative error at the order of $10^{-7}$ can be reached with bond dimension $D=70$. On the other hand, with bond dimension $D=60$, the relative errors of the critical exponents $\nu, \beta, \alpha$ are at the order of $10^{-2}$. Increasing the bond dimension to $D=90$, these relative errors can be reduced at least to the order of $10^{-3}$. In all cases our results indicate that the errors can be systematically reduced by increasing the bond dimension and the stacking number.</p></details> |  |

They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state (MPS) ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron (LSH) framework. The LSH framework has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to varying gauge groups [SU(2) and SU(3)], boundary conditions, and in higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in achieving the continuum limit of the static observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1) D and pushing the boundary of dynamical studies. The current toolbox can be applied to studying scattering processes in this model. It can also be straightforwardly generalized to (2+1)D given the simplified constraints in an LSH framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>A mor...</summary><p>A more clear data analysis is required, and this version needs to be withdrawn at the moment</p></details> |
| **[VeloxQ: A Fast and Efficient QUBO Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19221v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VeloxQ, a fast and efficient solver for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are central to numerous real-world optimization tasks. Unlike other physics-inspired approaches to optimization problems, such as quantum annealing and quantum computing, VeloxQ does not require substantial progress of technology to unlock its full potential. We benchmark VeloxQ against the state-of-the-art QUBO solvers based on emerging technologies. Our comparison includes quantum annealers, specifically D-Wave's Advantage, and Advantage2 prototype platforms, the digital-quantum algorithm designed to solve Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) developed by Kipu Quantum, physics-inspired algorithms: Simulated Bifurcation and Parallel Annealing and an algorithm based on tropical tensor networks. We also take into account modern developments of conventional algorithms: Branch and Bound algorithm, an optimal implementation of the brute-force algorithm and BEIT QUBO solver. Our results show that VeloxQ not only matches but often surpasses the mentioned solvers in solution quality and runtime. Additionally, VeloxQ demonstrates excellent scalability being the only solver capable of solving large-scale optimization problems, including up to $2\times 10^{8}$ sparsely connected variables, that are currently intractable for its competitors. These findings position VeloxQ as a powerful and practical tool for tackling large-scale QUBO and HUBO problems, offering a compelling alternative to existing quantum and classical optimization methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grassmann tensor approach for two-dimensional QCD in the strong-coupling expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19192v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of two-dimensional QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential. After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta<0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, proceedings of the 41st International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory, LATTICE2024, Liverpool, 28th July - 3rd August 2024</p></details> |
| **[Embedding of Tree Tensor Networks into Shallow Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18856v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are being highlighted as key quantum algorithms for demonstrating quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are limited to executing shallow quantum circuits because of noise. However, the barren plateau problem, where the gradient of the loss function becomes exponentially small with system size, hinders this goal. Recent studies suggest that embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits and initializing the parameters can avoid the barren plateau. Yet, embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits is generally difficult, and methods have been limited to the simplest structure, Matrix Product States (MPSs). This study proposes a method to embed Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs), characterized by their hierarchical structure, into shallow quantum circuits. TTNs are suitable for representing two-dimensional systems and systems with long-range correlations, which MPSs are inadequate for representing. Our numerical results show that embedding TTNs provides better initial quantum circuits than MPS. Additionally, our method has a practical computational complexity, making it applicable to a wide range of TTNs. This study is expected to extend the application of VQAs to two-dimensional systems and those with long-range correlations, which have been challenging to utilize.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Regularized second-order optimization of tensor-network Born machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18691v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor-network Born machines (TNBMs) are quantum-inspired generative models for learning data distributions. Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function that is commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability, efficiency, and generalization.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18688v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phases with topological order exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: States with the same topological order are distinguished by how their anyonic excitations transform under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological phases. In this work, we develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune between wavefunctions of different symmetry fractionalization. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are completely immobile as individual particles. By deforming the local tensors that describe the ground state of the fixed point model, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions have non-vanishing correlation lengths and are non-stabilizer states. At the critical points between the phases, power-law correlations are supported in certain spatial directions. Furthermore, based on the isoTNS description of the wavefunction, we determine a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme for which a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays suffices to encode the three-dimensional state using measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order based on the language of tensor networks and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order with quantum processors.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources through Operator Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18679v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, and serves as strong dynamical signature of quantum chaos. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + appendices, 2 figures, comments welcome!</p></details> |

| **[Quantum algorithm for partial differential equations of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05019v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial for modeling various physical phenomena such as heat transfer, fluid flow, and electromagnetic waves. In computer-aided engineering (CAE), the ability to handle fine resolutions and large computational models is essential for improving product performance and reducing development costs. However, solving large-scale PDEs, particularly for systems with spatially varying material properties, poses significant computational challenges. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving second-order linear PDEs of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters, using the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method. Our approach transforms those PDEs into ordinary differential equations represented by qubit operators, through spatial discretization using the finite difference method. Then, we provide an algorithm that efficiently constructs the operator corresponding to the spatially varying parameters of PDEs via a logic minimization technique, which reduces the number of terms and subsequently the circuit depth. We also develop a scalable method for realizing a quantum circuit for LCHS, using a tensor-network-based technique, specifically a matrix product state (MPS). We validate our method with applications to the acoustic equation with spatially varying parameters and the dissipative heat equation. Our approach includes a detailed recipe for constructing quantum circuits for PDEs, leveraging efficient encoding of spatially varying parameters of PDEs and scalable implementation of LCHS, which we believe marks a significant step towards advancing quantum computing's role in solving practical engineering problems.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Realization of Two-dimensional Discrete Time Crystals with Anisotropic Heisenberg Coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18036v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A discrete time crystal (DTC) is the paradigmatic example of a phase of matter that occurs exclusively in systems out of equilibrium. This phenomenon is characterized by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of discrete time-translation and provides a rich playground to study a fundamental question in statistical physics: what mechanism allows for driven quantum systems to exhibit emergent behavior that deviates from their counterparts with time-independent evolution? Unlike equilibrium phases, DTCs exhibit macroscopic manifestations of coherent quantum dynamics, challenging the conventional narrative that thermodynamic behavior universally erases quantum signatures. However, due to the difficulty of simulating these systems with either classical or quantum computers, previous studies have been limited to a set of models with Ising-like couplings -- and mostly only in one dimension -- thus precluding our understanding of the existence (or not) of DTCs in models with interactions that closely align with what occurs in nature. In this work, by combining the latest generation of IBM quantum processors with state-of-the-art tensor network methods, we are able to demonstrate the existence of a DTC in a two-dimensional system governed by anisotropic Heisenberg interactions. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a rich phase diagram encompassing spin-glass, ergodic, and time-crystalline phases, highlighting the tunability of these phases through multiple control parameters. Crucially, our results emphasize the interplay of initialization, interaction anisotropy, and driving protocols in stabilizing the DTC phase. By extending the study of Floquet matter beyond simplified models, we lay the groundwork for exploring how driven systems bridge the gap between quantum coherence and emergent non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</p></details> |  |

New striking features are the triple end of the Haldane phase and the complexity of phases bordering the Haldane phase in proximity allowing moving to nearby non-SPT phases via small perturbations. These characteristics make the system, which appears in Rydberg excitons, e.g. in Cu$_2$O, a prime candidate for applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper (7 pages 10 figures) + Appendix (4 pages 4 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09169v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.</p></details> | <details><summary>Post ...</summary><p>Post peer-review version accepted for publication; link to data & code added</p></details> |

Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 21 figures, (Re-)Submission to SciPost Added X-cube simulations, extended Figure 9 (and additional Figure 20), added references</p></details> |
| **[Charge fluctuations, hydrodynamics and transport in the square-lattice Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04047v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling, we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the strong-coupling regimes.</p></details> | 27 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18937v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave functions in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schr\"odinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges) via the Land\'e subtraction method. Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

This problem is known to depend on the choice of representation basis. We propose a systematic approach for mitigating the sign problem independent of the given Hamiltonian or lattice structure. We first introduce the concept of negativity to characterize the severity of the negative sign problem. We then demonstrate the existence of a locally defined quantity, the L1 adaptive loss function, which effectively approximates negativity, especially in frustration-free systems. Using the proposed loss function, we demonstrate that optimizing the representation basis can mitigate the negative sign. This is evidenced by several frustration-free models and other important quantum spin systems. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unitary transformations against the standard orthogonal transformation and reveal that unitary transformations can effectively mitigate the sign problem in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15428v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</p></details> |  |

The recently devised time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method allows a self-consistent treatment of the system of particles together with bath oscillators first for imaginary-time propagation of Schroedinger type of equations where both the system and the bath converge to their finite temperature ground state, and next for real time calculation where the dissipative dynamics is demonstrated. In that context the application of TDQMC appears as promising alternative to the path-integral related techniques where the real time propagation can be a challenge.</p></details> |  |

By solving concurrently sets of up to 20 000 coupled 3D time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the guide waves and corresponding sets of first order equations of motion for the Monte Carlo walkers we obtain ground state energies in close agreement with the exact values. The combined use of spherical coordinates and B-splines along the radial coordinate proves to be especially accurate and efficient for such calculations. Our results for the dipole response and the ionization of an atom with un-correlated electrons are in good agreement with the predictions of the conventional time-dependent Hartree-Fock method while the calculations with correlated electrons show enhanced ionization that is due to the electron-electron repulsion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adhesion and Reconstruction of Graphene/Hexagonal Boron Nitride Heterostructures: A Quantum Monte Carlo Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16567v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate interlayer adhesion and relaxation at interfaces between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers in van der Waals heterostructures. The adhesion potential between graphene and hBN is calculated as a function of local lattice offset using diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods, which provide an accurate treatment of van der Waals interactions. Combining the adhesion potential with elasticity theory, we determine the relaxed structures of graphene and hBN layers at interfaces, finding no metastable structures. The adhesion potential is well described by simple Lennard-Jones pair potentials that we parameterize using our quantum Monte Carlo data. Encapsulation of graphene between near-aligned crystals of hBN gives rise to a moir\'{e} pattern whose period is determined by the misalignment angle between the hBN crystals superimposed over the moir\'{e} superlattice previously studied in graphene on an hBN substrate. We model minibands in such supermoir\'{e} superlattices and find them to be sensitive to a 180$^\circ$ rotation of one of the encapsulating hBN crystals. We find that monolayer and bilayer graphene placed on a bulk hBN substrate and bulk hBN/graphene/bulk hBN systems do not relax to adopt a common lattice constant. The energetic balance is much closer for free-standing monolayer graphene/hBN bilayers and hBN/graphene/hBN trilayers. The layers in an alternating stack of graphene and hBN are predicted to strain to adopt a common lattice constant and hence we obtain a new, stable three-dimensional crystal with a unique electronic structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Critical gate distance for Wigner crystallization in the two-dimensional electron gas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16430v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on the properties of the two-dimensional electron gas in a dual-gate geometry, using quantum Monte Carlo methods to obtain aspects of the phase diagram as a function of electron density and gate distance. We identify the critical gate distance below which the Wigner crystal phase disappears. For larger gate distances, the system undergoes a re-entrant transition from crystal to liquid at sufficiently low density. We also present preliminary evidence for a fully polarized ferromagnetic liquid state at low electron density and intermediate gate distances. The quantum Monte Carlo results are compared with simpler approximate methods, which are shown to be semi-quantitatively reliable for determining key features of the phase diagram. These methods are then used to obtain the phase boundary between the Wigner crystal and liquid in the single-gate geometry.</p></details> | 4+4 pages |
| **[Polynomial-time-scaling quantum dynamics with time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16137v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here we study the dynamics of many-body quantum systems using time dependent quantum Monte Carlo method where the evolution is described by ensembles of particles and guide waves. The exponential-time scaling inherent to the quantum many-body problem is reduced to polynomial-time computation by solving concurrently a set of coupled Schroedinger equations for the guide waves in physical space and a set first order equations for the Monte Carlo walkers. We use effective potentials to accounts for the local and nonlocal quantum correlations in time-varying fields, where for fermionic states an exchange 'hole' is introduced explicitly through screened Coulomb potentials. The walker distributions for the ground states of para- and ortho-helium reproduce well the statistical properties, such as the electron-pair density function, of the real atoms. Our predictions for the dipole response and the ionization of an atom exposed to strong ultrashort optical pulse are in good agreement with the exact results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecular dynamics with time dependent quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16132v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we propose an ab initio method to solve quantum many-body problems of molecular dynamics where both the electronic and the nuclear degrees are represented by ensembles of trajectories and guiding waves in physical space. Both electrons and nuclei can be treated quantum mechanically where the guiding waves obey a set of coupled Schrodinger equations (quantum-quantum description) or, alternatively, coupled Schroedinger-Newtonian equations are solved for the quantum-classical approximation. The method takes into account local and non-local quantum correlation effects in a self consistent manner. The general formalism is applied to one- and two-dimensional hydrogen molecule subjected to a strong ultashort optical pulse. Comparison is made with the results from the 'exact' Ehrenfest molecular dynamics for the molecular ionization and for the evolution of the inter-nuclear distance as the molecule dissociates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic correlations with time dependent quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16072v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we solve quantum many-body problem by propagating ensembles of trajectories and guiding waves in physical space. We introduce the 'effective potential' correction within the recently proposed time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo methodology to incorporate the nonlocal quantum correlation effects between the electrons. The associated correlation length is calculated by adaptive kernel density estimation over the walker distribution. The general formalism is developed and tested on one-dimensional Helium atom in laser field of different intensity and carrier frequency. Good agreement with exact results for the atomic ionization is obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of superconducting pairing in doped cuprates and nickelates within an extended Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08717v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within a Hubbard model, we investigate the superconducting pairing behavior of infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{NdNiO_2}$ and cuprate superconductors by using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method. Our focus is on comparing their dominant pairing symmetries. The results indicate that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is significantly enhanced at low temperatures in both doped nickelates and cuprates, whereas other typical pairing symmetries are effectively suppressed, highlighting the dominance of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing form. Additionally, we find that the effective pairing interaction for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing in doped nickelates is slightly lower than that in doped cuprates, which may be attributed to the different degrees of Fermi surface warping caused by the third-nearest hopping $t''$. Further studies show that the hole doping and interaction strength have significant effects on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction within the selected parameter range. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is notably weakened when the hole doping increases, whereas it is significantly enhanced with increasing Coulomb interaction strength $U$. This comparative analysis reveals the similarities and differences in the pairing behaviors of doped nickelates and cuprates, which may provide further insights into understanding the superconducting properties of these two classes of materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages and 12 figures.

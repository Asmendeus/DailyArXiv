| **[Mathieu Control of the Effective Coupling in Superconducting Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24992v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common challenge in superconducting quantum circuits is the trade-off between strong coupling and computational subspace integrity. We present Mathieu control, which uses a non-resonant two-photon drive to create a selective nonlinear frequency shift. This shift modifies interactions while preserving qubit states, enabling continuous tuning of the ZZ coupling, including full suppression, and integrating single- and two-qubit gates with low leakage. For a qubit-coupler-qubit device, it allows independent ZZ control, facilitating a programmable Heisenberg (XXZ) Hamiltonian. Extended to a five-qubit chain, the system can be reconfigured to simulate dynamics of quantum magnetic phases. Mathieu control thus provides a framework for high-fidelity quantum logic and programmable simulation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Superconducting State and Collective Modes in Kagome Superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24831v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We comprehensively study the unconventional pairing and collective modes in the multiband kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=$\mathrm{K},\mathrm{Cs},\mathrm{Rb}$). By solving gap equations at zero temperature, we identify a transition from normal $s++/s\pm$-wave pairing to time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking pairing with a variation of inter-pocket interactions or density of states. This TRS breaking pairing originates from the superconducting phase frustration of different Fermi pockets and can account for experimental TRS breaking signal in kagome superconductors. Moreover, we investigate collective modes, including the Higgs, Leggett, and Bogoloubov-Anderson-Goldstone modes, arising from fluctuations of the amplitude, relative phase, and overall phase of the superconducting order parameters, respectively. Remarkably, due to the presence of multibands, one branch of the Leggett modes becomes nearly massless near the TRS breaking transition, providing a compelling smoking-gun signature of TRS-breaking superconductivity, in clear contrast to TRS-breaking charge orders. Our results elucidate the rich superconducting physics and its associated collective modes in kagome metals, and suggest feasible experimental detection of TRS breaking pairing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Observing unconventional superconductivity via kinetic inductance in Weyl semimetal MoTe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24671v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors plays an essential role in the ongoing quest to understand correlated electronic matter. A long-standing approach is to study the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth $λ$ for evidence of nodal points where the superconducting gap vanishes. However, experimental reports can be ambiguous due to the requisite low-temperature resolution, and the similarity in signatures of nodal quasiparticles and impurity states. Here we study the pairing symmetry of Weyl semimetal $T_d$-MoTe$_2$, where previous measurements of $λ$ have yielded conflicting results. We utilize a novel technique based on a microwave resontor to measure the kinetic inductance of MoTe$_2$, which is directly related to $λ$. The high precision of this technique allows us to observe power-law temperature dependence of $λ$, and to measure the anomalous nonlinear Meissner effect -- the current dependence of $λ$ arising from nodal quasiparticles. Together, these measurements provide smoking gun signatures of nodal superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+6 p...</summary><p>8+6 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Ultracoherent superconducting cavity-based multiqudit platform with error-resilient control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03286v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with an estimated coherence-limited fidelities of 99.9% after post-selection. These results establish our platform as a robust foundation for quantum information processing, allowing for future extensions to high-dimensional qudit encodings.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages with 3 main figures and 13 supplementary figures</p></details> |

We reveal the structure of superconducting Berry curvatures in such systems, and derived the superconducting Berry curvature induced thermal Edelstein effect and spin Nernst effect. We calculate these two thermo-spin responses with model systems where Rashba spin-orbit coupling, proximity induced superconductivity, and ferromagnetic order are coexisting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The long paper that is joint submitted with arXiv: 2412.08451</p></details> |
| **[Reentrant Superconductivity from Competing Spin-Triplet Instabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23954v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reentrant superconductivity in strong magnetic fields challenges the conventional expectation that magnetic fields necessarily suppress superconductivity. We show that reentrant superconductivity arises generically from the competition between spinful and spin-polarized superconducting instabilities. Using a minimal Ginzburg-Landau theory with two coupled spin-triplet order parameters, we demonstrate that a magnetic field can reorganize the hierarchy of superconducting instabilities, yielding a characteristic reentrant instability curve independent of microscopic details.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity from phonon-mediated retardation in a single-flavor metal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23790v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study phonon-mediated pairings in a single-flavor metal with a tunable Berry curvature. In the absence of Berry curvature, we discover an unexpected possibility: $p$-wave superconductivity emerging purely from the retardation effect, while the static BCS approximation fails to predict its existence. The gap function exhibits sign-change behavior in frequency (owing to the dynamical structure of the phonon-mediated interaction in the $p$-wave channel), and $T_c$ obeys a BCS-like scaling. We further show that the Berry curvature stabilizes the chiral $p$-wave superconductivity and can induce transitions to higher-angular-momentum pairings. Our results establish that the phonon-mediated mechanism is a viable pairing candidate in single-flavor systems, such as the quarter-metal superconductivity observed in rhombohedral graphene multilayers.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+5 p...</summary><p>6+5 pages, 4+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Strain-tuned structural, electronic, and superconducting properties of thin-film La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23630v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient-pressure in strained thin films raises the question of how superconductivity can be optimized through strain. In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Photogalvanic and photon drag phenomena in superconductors and hybrid superconducting systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23516v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we review the recent progress in theoretical understanding of the peculiarities of photogalvanic phenomena, photon drag and inverse Faraday effects in superconductors and hybrid superconducting structures. Our study is based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory with a complex relaxation constant which provides the simplest description of the mechanisms of the second-order nonlinear effects in the electrodynamic response and related mechanisms of generation of dc photocurrents, magnetic moment and switching between different current states under the influence of electromagnetic radiation of various polarization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Efficient flip-chip and on-chip-based modulation of flux-tunable superconducting resonators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23119v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate the efficient modulation of flux-tunable superconducting resonators (FTRs) using flip-chip or on-chip-based input coils. The FTRs we use are aluminum-based quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators terminated with 100um or 200um-wide square loop dc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing 1um-sized Josephson junctions. We employ SQUIDs with a geometric loop inductance of up to 0.7nH to increase the flux transfer efficiency. The geometric inductance of the SQUID results in a non-zero screening parameter $β_L$, whose branch switching effect is mitigated by using asymmetric junctions. We achieve flux modulation of the FTRs by more than one GHz and flux responsivities of up to tens of GHz/$Φ_0$ with uA-scale on-chip currents. We compare flip-chip with on-chip input-coil-based flux modulation, where the former is realized through galvanically connected and closely spaced chips, while the latter is achieved through superconducting air-bridge connections. We achieve a flux-transfer efficiency from the input coil to the SQUID loop of up to 20%. Our work paves the way for efficient low current flux modulation of FTRs and sensitive measurement of flux signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Effect of superconductivity by Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22430v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Materials featuring kagome lattices have attracted significant research interest due to their unique geometric frustration, which gives rise to rich physical phenomena such as non-trivial topology, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity. In this work, using CaPd5 as the prototype structure, we discover and systematically investigate a new class of kagome superconductors, CaMxPd5-x (M = Nb and V) alloys. First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3. CaNb5 is identified as a strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) superconductor with the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 10.1 K, which can be further increased to 12.8 K under external pressure. In contrast, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 exhibit weaker EPC and correspondingly lower Tc values. Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5 provides an effective route for designing a new type of kagome superconductor with relatively high Tc. This study also offers new perspectives on topological superconductivity in kagome systems and establishes a useful guideline for discovering other superconducting materials with unique properties.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[$p$-wave superconductivity and Josephson current in $p$-wave unconventional magnet/$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18636v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the surface density of states in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems ($p$-wave unconventional magnetic superconductors), by using the effective $p$-wave unconventional magnet model [B. Brekke, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236703 (2024)]. Owing to the noncollinear spin structure along the $x$-direction, the quasiparticle energy dispersion has the spin-triplet $p_x$-wave energy gap structure, and then zero-energy flat bands emerge at the [100] edge. Analyzing the pair amplitude at the [100] edge, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pairing is induced in the presence of zero-energy flat bands, while even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity remains. We also demonstrate the Josephson current in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnet-conventional $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems. By the cooperation of spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential and the $p$-wave unconventional magnetic order, the current phase relation shows the $\varphi$-junction in the high-transparency but also the temperature dependence of the Josephson current caused by the coupling of the spin-singlet even-parity pairings in the low-transparency limit, even though $p$-wave superconductivity is mainly realized both in the bulk and at the edge. Our calculations provide the possible superconducting phenomena and transport properties in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Criticality as a Universal Thermodynamic Requirement for Perfect Intrinsic Superconducting Diodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21384v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting diodes promise dissipation-less rectification, yet intrinsic platforms invariably have very low efficiencies. We reveal a fundamental thermodynamic origin of this behavior that is independent of microscopic details. Denoting $ε= I_c^-/I_c^+$, where $I_c^\pm$ are critical current magnitudes in opposite directions with $I_c^+>I_c^-$ by convention, we show that $ε=0$ is impossible without fine-tuning, while $ε\to0$ can occur but only upon tuning to a critical point \emph{within} the superconducting state. Away from such internal instabilities, using general Landau theory, we derive a lower bound on $ε$ that limits intrinsic diode performance. We illustrate these ideas in a minimal superconductor-Ising model, where the strong nonreciprocity can be seen explicitly. In particular, if the internal transition is continuous, we show that the scaling of $ε$ near the transition is locked to known critical exponents.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Quantum Geometry Induced Kekulé Superconductivity in Haldane phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21791v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekulè superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[3D cavity-based graphene superconducting quantum circuits in two-qubit architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21213v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct a series of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits and integrate them into 3D cavities. For a single-qubit device, we demonstrate flux-tunable qubit transition, with a measured $T_1$ $\approx$ 48 ns and a lower bound estimate of $T_2^\ast$ $\approx$ 17.63 ns. By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[All-optical control and multiplexed readout of multiple superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21199v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting quantum circuits operate at millikelvin temperatures, typically requiring independent microwave cables for each qubit for connecting room-temperature control and readout electronics. However, scaling to large-scale processors hosting hundreds of qubits faces a severe input/output (I/O) bottleneck, as the dense cable arrays impose prohibitive constraints on physical footprint, thermal load, wiring complexity, and cost. Here we demonstrate a complete optical I/O architecture for superconducting quantum circuits, in which all control and readout signals are transmitted exclusively via optical photons. Employing a broadband traveling-wave Brillouin microwave-to-optical transducer, we achieve simultaneous frequency-multiplexed optical readout of two qubits. Combined with fiber-integrated photodiode arrays for control signal delivery, this closed-loop optical I/O introduces no measurable degradation to qubit coherence times, with an optically driven single-qubit gate fidelity showing only a 0.19% reduction relative to standard microwave operation. These results establish optical interconnects as a viable path toward large-scale superconducting quantum processors, and open the possibility of networking multiple superconducting quantum computers housed in separate dilution refrigerators through a centralized room-temperature control infrastructure.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Distinct Suppression Mechanisms of Superconductivity by Magnetic Domains and Spin Fluctuations in EuFe2(As1-xPx)2 superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20364v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using ac composite magnetoelectric technique, we map the phase diagrams of EuFe(As1-xPx)2 to resolve the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. For samples with Tc<TFM, the transition to a ferromagnetic multi-domain state suppresses Hc2 through the breakdown of Jaccarino-Peter compensation and enhanced magnetic scattering from inter-domain disorder, while Hirr is reduced due to vortex-antivortex pair nucleation at domain walls disrupting the vortex lattice. Conversely, for samples with Tc>TFM, strong short-range spin correlations and phase boundaries within a multiphase coexistence regime near the triple point act as potent pair-breaking centers, leading to pronounced Hc2 suppression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evidence for Clean d-wave Superconductivity in Samarium Nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20928v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconducting nickelates provides a unique opportunity to explore the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we use ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to probe the temperature-dependent superfluid density in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate film with a Tc of 20 K. The superfluid density decreases linearly with rising temperature, consistent with clean limit d-wave pairing. From this linear relation, we extract a superconducting gap of 2.5 meV and a gap-to-Tc ratio of 3, suggesting that this sample lies in the weak-coupling limit. Furthermore, the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length, is determined to be 1.5, confirming the clean-limit behavior. These findings establish strong parallels between the pairing mechanisms in nickelate and cuprate superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tutorial on Superconducting Quantum Circuits: From Basics to Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20913v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As superconducting circuits emerge as a leading platform for scalable quantum information processing, building comprehensive bridges from the foundational principles of macroscopic quantum phenomena to the architecture of modern quantum devices is increasingly essential for introducing new researchers to the field. This tutorial provides a self-contained, pedagogical introduction to superconducting quantum circuits at the undergraduate level. Beginning with an overview of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, the tutorial systematically develops the quantization of microwave circuits into the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime. This work serves as a foundational guide and first point of contact, equipping students and researchers with the conceptual and mathematical tools necessary to understand and engineer superconducting quantum hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Drastic field-induced resistivity upturns as signatures of unconventional magnetism in superconducting iron chalcogenides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20862v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic scattering is a powerful tool to identify underlying changes in electronic behavior and incipient electronic and magnetic orders. The nematic and magnetic phases are strongly intertwined under applied pressure in FeSe, however, the additional isoelectronic substitution of sulphur offers an elegant way to separate them. Here we report the detailed evolution of the electronic and superconducting behaviour of FeSe$_{0.96}$S$_{0.04}$ under applied pressure via longitudinal magnetoresistance studies up to 15T. At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem. This study highlights the essential role of high magnetic fields in stabilizing different electronic phases and revealing a complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity tuned by applied pressure in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Non-Equilibrium Steady States and Quantum Chaos in a three-site Driven-Dissipative Bose-Hubbard Chains base on Self-Consistent Mean-Field Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12844v4)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assembling a Bose-Hubbard superfluid from tweezer-controlled single atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24374v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating triangle Hofstadter-Hubbard model with fermionic projected entangled simplex states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21503v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The triangular Hofstadter-Hubbard model, realizable in moiré bilayers, provides a fertile ground for discovering correlated topological states. We investigate this model in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fermionic infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS) approach, which offers direct access to the stability of the emergent correlated states at the thermodynamic limit. Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility. Finite-correlation-length scaling of the magnetization reveals a transition into a large-$U$ $120^\circ$ Néel phase at $U_{c_2} \approx 22.5$. Remarkably, with finite hole doping $δ$, we identify a uniform superconducting state with a finite pairing amplitude, whose order parameter displays a nearly universal phase winding across the $U$-$δ$ phase diagram. Our work demonstrates robust chiral superconductivity in the thermodynamic limit through doping Chern insulator and CSL.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Hartree-Fock phase diagram for the two-dimensional Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20441v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an analytical method for the construction of Hartree-Fock phase diagrams for the (fermion) Hubbard model and various generalizations thereof. Such phase diagrams are traditionally constructed numerically, but we argue that, by using asymptotic techniques, it is possible to obtain analytic formulas approximating the curves separating the different phases to very high accuracy. To illustrate the new method, we apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at zero temperature. This yields formulas for the Hartree-Fock phase boundaries that agree with, but also improve on, earlier numerical results. In particular, our results provide the first rigorous proof of the existence of mixed phases in this model.</p></details> | 59 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Comparing Hubbard parameters from linear-response theory and Hartree-Fock-based approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16803v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06284v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical state-vector simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to ${6\times 6}$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including different on-site electron-electron interaction strengths and magnetic flux values, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons (charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation), dynamical symmetry-breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled background state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that meaningful programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now feasible on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p></details> | 94 pages, 76 figures |

In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</p></details> |  |

It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $Δ$, vanishes like $\exp(-2π\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U>0$ and $t>0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages; v2: shorter proof of main result</p></details> |

We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 Main text figures, 9 Supplementary figures</p></details> |

By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly-interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled approach for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages with 2 figures; to appear in PRA</p></details> |

Specifically, we apply this method to the driven Bose-Hubbard chain to illustrate the competition between coherent driving, hopping, and on-site interactions. Unlike the asymptotic high-dimensional statistics regime in random systems, here the randomness emerges dynamically from the interplay between the driving field $F$ and the nonlinearity $U$. We reveal the relation between the UV cutoff of the effective momentum space (related to the particle number truncation) and the system's chaotic behavior (SYK-like features). The inverse of the effective Hilbert space cutoff, acting as an essential degree-of-freedom (DOF) other than the bosonic modes, relates to the distribution and statistical variance of the interaction-induced coupling. By mapping the 1D chain to a high-dimensional feature space via a Gaussian-based self-attention mechanism, we replace the direct diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian with a predictive algorithm where the flavor number $O(M)$ is determined by the local potential difference generated by the Kerr non-linearity $\frac{1}{2}U$. The resulting system follows statistics intermediate between the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), contingent on the ratio $U/J$. Our algorithm allows for the automatic optimization and prediction of the resulting many-body spectrum to arbitrary accuracy, revealing non-Fermi liquid-like behavior in the strongly interacting bosonic phase.</p></details> |  |

Using Jordan-Wigner transformation, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the subsystem Loschmidt echo, and systematically investigate how its properties vary with subsystem size. It is found that when the subsystem is sufficiently large, it exhibits logarithmic divergence identical to that of the full system Loschmidt echo, yielding a critical exponent of zero. We also obtain the required subsystem size and temporal resolution for detecting dynamical quantum phase transitions using the subsystem Loschmidt echo. It is expected that the present results provide a reliable foundation for further experimental investigations.</p></details> |  |

Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $ν=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $ν=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $ν=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figures |

Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal superconductivity(SC) occurs at a moderate imbalance. Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. In addition, the SC can be possibly hosted by a single layer, which is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Within the variationally exact in infinite dimensions Gutzwiller approximation, we derive a compact analytic expression for the phase boundary between Mott and band insulator. While the method reproduces the expected band-Mott insulator phenomenology, it does not capture the correlated metallic state at finite staggered potential found for example in dynamical mean-field theory. This absence highlights that the metallic phase originates from incoherent Hubbard-band physics rather than Fermi-liquid behavior well captured by Gutzwiller approximation. Our formulation establishes a concise variational framework to ionic Hubbard model, with natural extensions to nonequilibrium setups and spin-exchange dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Acta Physica Polonica B as proceedings of the Concepts in Strongly Correlated Quantum Matter 2025 conference</p></details> |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |

Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures + supplemental</p></details> |

In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($δ\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments.

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity in a bilayer $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07545v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $δ= 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $δ= 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures.

Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\rm DW} \approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Magnetism of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22371v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the magnetic ground state of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates is crucial, as these materials exhibit superconductivity under high pressure and host competing electronic orders that may play a key role in the pairing mechanism. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $ΔT_{SDW} \simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p></details> |  |

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\it within} the $γ$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Using fully self-consistent DFT+$U$ calculations on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures, we identify that intrinsic hole doping via interfacial Sr interdiffusion is the decisive factor in stabilizing the metallic state. Our 1-unit-cell model accurately reproduces the ARPES-observed Fermi surface, particularly the critical Ni-$d_{z^2}$ derived $γ$ hole pocket, which originates exclusively from the interface-proximal bilayer. Furthermore, comparative tight-binding analysis suggests that the reduced superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in thin films stems from the synergistic suppression of the electronic density of states (DOS) and vertical superexchange coupling ($J \perp Z$). These findings highlight that interface engineering plays a critical role beyond simple strain imposition in modulating nickelate orbital physics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional Hubbard model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries.

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario.

In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $χ({\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the Néel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping).</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.</p></details> |  |

Yet, despite intense recent activity, we lack experimentally testable protocols for distinguishing between different pairing scenarios. In this Letter, we construct a minimal two-band model that reproduces the Fermi-surface topology observed in recent ARPES measurements and DFT calculations, and we analyze superconductivity arising from two distinct pairing mechanisms. We show that these mechanisms yield sharply different responses to an applied perpendicular electric field. Thus, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers the unique opportunity to cleanly distinguish between different pairing scenarios. Finally, we propose three concrete experimental proposals designed to distinguish these scenarios and thereby identify the pairing mechanism most relevant to the real material.</p></details> |  |

Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.</p></details> |  |

Our results reveal two coexisting density waves that can be selectively manipulated with light. We directly identify a spin-density wave (SDW) with electronic nematicity emerging below $T_{\rm SDW}$ $\approx$ 140 K by measuring its spin dynamics, and discover a distinct, nonmagnetic charge order appearing below $T_{\rm DW}$ $\approx$ 115 K. The central finding is the demonstration of differential optical control: the charge order is fragile, completely suppressed by a pump fluence of approximately 40 $μ$J/cm$^2$, while the SDW is remarkably robust, persisting to 200 $μ$J/cm$^2$. This work establishes a clear hierarchy in the stability of competing electronic orders and provides a powerful method for disentangling their interplay in quantum materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superexchanges and Charge Transfer in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04739v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films represents a significant advance in the field of nickelate superconductor. Motivated by the experimental reports, here we study an 11-band $d-p$ Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations, using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the major superexchange couplings in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films can be substantially weaker than in the bulk material at 29.5 Gpa. Specifically, the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is reduced by about 27\% in film, while the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unaffected. We evaluate the corresponding antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\perp}$ and $J_{\parallel}$ using perturbation theory. With regard to charge transfer properties, we find that the biaxial compression in films reduces charge transfer gap. We also resolve the orbital distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals, uncovering a pronounced particle-hole asymmetry. Theses findings lay a groundwork for the study of low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and provide key insights into the understanding of physical distinctions between the film and bulk bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Apical vacancies and interbilayer interstitials emerge as the dominant low-energy defect species and are further stabilized by orthorhombic domain walls. These two defect classes drive the electronic structure in opposing directions. Vacancy-induced disorder generates local magnetic moments and promotes Anderson localization at moderate concentrations, whereas periodic interstitial ordering yields a coherent but weakly correlated metallic background that fails to support superconductivity. These findings highlight the decisive role of oxygen defects in shaping the superconducting and provide microscopic guidance for improving superconductivity through controlled defect engineering.</p></details> |  |

It is eager to enhance $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. We propose that a perpendicular electric field strongly enhances $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Under electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing is suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is strongly enhanced. We numerically verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between layers is enough to realize liquid-nitrogen-temperature HTSC in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version accepted by Nature Communications</p></details> |

Despite extensive work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. We argue that different superconducting states in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni $3d$ and O $2p$ states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ within the random phase approximation and find a transition between $d$-wave and sign-changing $s$-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin fluctuations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+6 p...</summary><p>8+6 pages, 4+10 figures</p></details> |

Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity are observed in the longitudinal elastic mode $c_{11}$ for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$ from $b$-axis. We confirm an upper critical field of $H_{\rm c2}\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and bulk superconductivity which survives up to $T\approx 2$ K for fields above the metamagnetic transition. The $c_{11}$ mode has propagation and displacement vectors along the $a$-axis, and for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$, this mode is sensitive to the elasticity of the vortex lattice. The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material included</p></details> |

Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures (including SI)</p></details> |

We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p></details> |  |

We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$.

| **[UTe$_2$: a narrow band superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07915v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $μ_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted as regular article</p></details> |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15147v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

We show that the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit $H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to $\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry. It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.</p></details> | 41pages, 14figures |
| **[Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15322v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $χ^b > χ^a > χ^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $χ^a > χ^c > χ^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |

In ultra-clean single crystals, we identify a field-induced phase transition within the superconducting state at 5.6 T, driven by metamagnetism. This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.</p></details> |  |

At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Magnetic penetration depth in topological superconductors: Effect of Majorana surface states and application for UTe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18441v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we examine how the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons and Majorana surface states influence the magnetic penetration depth in the superconductor UTe$_2$. We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($κ$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$κ$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $κ$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</p></details> | 21 pages. 17 figures |

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18564v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $Δλ(T) \sim T^α$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $α< 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{α_R}$ with $α_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.</p></details> | 29 pages, 23 figures |

This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state. Taking into account the large decrease in $K_a$ in the SC state, we conclude that the $\boldsymbol{d}$ vector has components along all three crystal axes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

The mechanisms underpinning many of these collective phenomena remain unknown, driving interest in creating artificial crystals which replicate the system of interest while allowing precise control of key parameters. Here we demonstrate the formation of highly tunable artificial crystals by superimposing a periodic electrostatic potential on the 2D electron gas in an ultra-shallow (25 nm deep) GaAs quantum well. The 100 nm period artificial crystal is identified by the formation of a new bandstructure, different from the original cubic crystal and specific to the artificial triangular lattice: transport measurements show the Hall coefficient changing sign as the chemical potential sweeps through the artificial bands. Uniquely, the artificial bandstructure can be continuously tuned to form linear graphene-like and flat kagome-like bands in a single device. A strong insulating state is observed at half filling of the kagome flat band, which is not expected in the absence of strong interactions. This state, unique to the kagome lattice, is consistent with a loop-current Wigner insulator, which arises from long-range Coulomb interaction and delocalised electrons between neighbouring empty sites. The ability to continuously tune the bandstructure and access flat bands through electrical gating within a single device opens a new route to studying collective quantum states.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Suppl.: 16 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi-liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982v3)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum xy model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moiré twisted bi-layer graphene and bi-layer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear in temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those due to Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln ω_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi-surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi-surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p></details> | 65 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01738v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hopf terms are topological theta terms that are associated with a host of interesting physics, including anyons, statistical transmutation, chiral edge states, and the quantum spin-Hall effect. Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $θ$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $π$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital Altermagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00509v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of \emph{orbital altermagnetism}, a symmetry-protected magnetic order of pure orbital degrees of freedom. It is characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking. First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$, so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand, it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO. The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.</p></details> | 16 Page, 9 Figures |
| **[Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagomé metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting state in a kagomé lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Ordered phases and superconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems subject to pair spin-orbit interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06190v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pair spin-orbit interaction can emerge in strongly-interacting systems characterized by a large spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagomé lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagomé lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagomé metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagomé lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09316v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |

However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $κ_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120°, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Connecting such bosonic $π$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $π$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</p></details> |  |

Their central premise is that strongly correlated matter can only be understood by studying the underlying entanglement structure and its associated (generalised) symmetries. In essence, tensor networks provide a compressed, holographic description of the complicated vacuum fluctuations in strongly correlated systems, and as such they break down the infamous many-body exponential wall. These lecture notes provide a concise overview of the most important conceptual, computational and mathematical aspects of this theory.</p></details> | Comments welcome |
| **[Tensor-Network Analysis of Root Patterns in the XXX Model with Open Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24182v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The string hypothesis for Bethe roots represents a cornerstone in the study of quantum integrable systems, providing access to physical quantities such as the ground-state energy and the finite-temperature free energy. While the $t-W$ scheme and the inhomogeneous $T-Q$ relation have enabled significant methodological advances for systems with broken $U(1)$ symmetry, the underlying physics induced by symmetry breaking remains largely unexplored, due to the previously unknown distributions of the transfer-matrix roots. In this paper, we propose a new approach to determining the patterns of zero roots and Bethe roots for the $Λ-θ$ and inhomogeneous Bethe ansatz equations using tensor-network algorithms. As an explicit example, we consider the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with non-diagonal boundary conditions. The exact structures of both zero roots and Bethe roots are obtained in the ground state for large system sizes, up to ($N\simeq 60$ and $100$). We find that even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, the Bethe and zero roots still exhibit a highly structured pattern. The zero roots organize into bulk strings, boundary strings, and additional roots, forming two dominant lines with boundary-string attachments. Correspondingly, the Bethe roots can be classified into four distinct types: regular roots, line roots, arc roots, and paired-line roots. These structures are associated with a real-axis line, a vertical line, characteristic arcs in the complex plane, and boundary-induced conjugate pairs. Comparative analysis reveals that the $t-W$ scheme generates significantly simpler root topologies than those obtained via off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz.</p></details> | 64 pages, 34 figures |

However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |

By performing time-evolution along a complex-time contour, the approach balances computational cost with the difficulty of spectral recovery, offering greater flexibility than methods confined to the real or imaginary axis. By complementing the complex-time evolution with an exponential fitting scheme, we faithfully extract real-time information at negligible cost. The resulting method obtains high-resolution spectra at a significantly lower computational cost than real-time evolution, offering a promising tool for ab initio studies of strongly correlated materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22720v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 + 7...</summary><p>8 + 7 pages; 6 + 6 figures</p></details> |

Quantum inspired generative models, such as Born machines based on the matrix product state framework, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in unsupervised learning tasks. This study advances the Born machine paradigm by introducing trainable token embeddings through positive operator valued measurements, replacing the traditional approach of static tensor indices. Key technical innovations include encoding tokens as quantum measurement operators with trainable parameters and leveraging QR decomposition to adjust the physical dimensions of the MPS. This approach maximizes the utilization of operator space and enhances the model's expressiveness. Empirical results on RNA data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces negative log likelihood compared to one hot embeddings, with higher physical dimensions further enhancing single site probabilities and multi site correlations. The model also outperforms GPT2 in single site estimation and achieves competitive correlation modeling, showcasing the potential of trainable POVM embeddings for complex data correlations in quantum inspired sequence modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph restricted tensors: building blocks for holographic networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23005v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze few-body quantum states with particular correlation properties imposed by the requirement of maximal bipartite entanglement for selected partitions of the system into two complementary parts. A novel framework to treat this problem by encoding these constraints in a graph is advocated; the resulting objects are called ``graph-restricted tensors''. This framework encompasses several examples previously treated in the literature, such as 1-uniform multipartite states, quantum states related to dual unitary operators and absolutely maximally entangled states (AME) corresponding to 2-unitary matrices. Original examples of presented graph-restricted tensors are motivated by tensor network models for the holographic principle. In concrete cases we find exact analytic solutions, demonstrating thereby that there exists a vast landscape of non-stabilizer tensors useful for the lattice models of holography.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07242v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_τ$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_τ$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_τ}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_τ)$ generated by $\mathcal H_τ$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_τ^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_τ)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_τ$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</p></details> | 53 pages, 11 figures |

This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages + appendices, 12 figures; v2 typos corrected and references added; v3: references added; discussion of difficulties in earlier works and their connection to the present work included; expanded discussion on RG and wavefunction tensor networks added; v4: Published version in SciPost Physics</p></details> |
| **[Holographic Tensor Networks as Tessellations of Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19452v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Holographic tensor networks serve as toy models for the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, capturing many of its essential features in a concrete manner. However, existing holographic tensor network models remain far from a complete theory of quantum gravity. A key obstacle is their discrete structure, which only approximates the semi-classical geometry of gravity in a qualitative sense. In \cite{Lin:2024dho}, it was shown that a network of partial-entanglement-entropy (PEE) threads, which are bulk geodesics with a specific density distribution, generates a perfect tessellation of AdS space. Moreover, such PEE-network tessellations can be constructed for more general geometries using the Crofton formula. In this paper, we assign a quantum state to each vertex in the PEE network and develop two holographic tensor network models: the factorized PEE tensor network, which takes the form of a tensor product of EPR pairs, and the random PEE tensor network. In both models we reproduce the exact Ryu-Takayanagi formula by showing that the minimal number of cuts along a homologous surface in the network exactly computes the area of this surface.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 15 figures.

Focusing on the fully antiferromagnetic $J$-$J_d$ model with $J_h = J_t := J$, we map out the ground-state phase diagram as a function of the dimer coupling $J_d$. Our results show that the system hosts only two phases: a magnetically ordered canted-$120^\circ$ phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase. We identify a first-order transition between these two phases at $J_d/J \approx 1.45$. Within the magnetically ordered phase, we observe small but finite magnetic moments. We also resolve the quantum renormalization of the canting angle, which deviates from the classical prediction over almost the entire magnetically ordered phase.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moiré systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moiré systems, including super-moiré with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moiré patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moiré, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moiré systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moiré systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review Research.

PRL 100, 030504 (2008)], it is shown how the approximation error of tree tensor network states (TTNS) can be bounded using Schmidt spectra or Rényi entanglement entropies of the target quantum state. Conversely, one obtains bounds on TTNS bond dimensions needed to achieve a specific approximation accuracy. For tree lattices, the result implies that efficient TTNS approximations exist if $α<1$ Rényi entanglement entropies for single-branch cuts obey an area law, as in ground and low-energy states of certain gapped systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Learning transitions of topological surface codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19786v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...</p></details> | 25 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Thermodynamics of large-scale chemical reaction networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19616v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical and biological networks can describe a wide variety of processes, from gene regulatory networks to biochemical oscillations. Modeled by chemical master equations, these processes are inherently stochastic, as fluctuations dominate deterministic order at mesoscopic scales. These classic many-body processes suffer from the so-called curse of high dimensionality, which makes exact mathematical descriptions exponentially expensive to compute. The exponential cost renders the study of the thermodynamic properties of such systems out of equilibrium intractable and forces approximations of system noise or assumptions of continuous particle numbers. Here, we use tensor networks to numerically explore the thermodynamics of chemical processes by directly solving the ensemble solution of the chemical master equation with efficient (sub-exponential) computational cost. We provide accurate estimates of the entropy production rate, heat flux, chemical work, and nonequilibrium thermodynamic potentials, free from sampling errors or mean-field approximations. We illustrate our results through a dissipative self-assembly model. In this way, we show how tensor networks can inform the design of efficient chemical processes in previously unattainable regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Input phase noise in Gaussian Boson sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19596v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian boson sampling is an important protocol for testing the performance of photonic quantum simulators. As such, various noise sources have been investigated that degrade the operation of such devices. In this paper, we examine a situation with phase noise between different modes of the input state leading to dephasing of the system. This models the phase fluctuations which remain even when the mean phase is controlled. We aim to determine whether these phase-noisy input states still form a computationally difficult problem. To do this, we use Matrix Product Operators to model the system, a technique recently used to model boson sampling scenarios. Our investigation finds that the Entanglement entropy grows linearly with the number of input states even for noisy input states. This implies that, unlike boson loss, this form of experimentally relevant noise remains difficult to simulate with tensor networks and may allow for the demonstration of quantum advantage without the need for implementing the challenging task of input-state phase stabilisation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Using tensor-network methods, we realize a one-parameter family of microscopic boundary conditions by continuously rotating the boundary-spin orientation and find two conformal boundary fixed points that correspond to the free and fixed boundaries. We extract conformal data, including the boundary entropies and the scaling dimensions of boundary primary operators, which characterize the boundary universality class. We further demonstrate that the free boundary fixed point exhibits multifractal scaling of boundary spin fields. Finally, we complement our numerical results with a renormalization group analysis and discuss a systematic bridge between the controlled $6-ε$ expansion and the 2D tensor network numerics.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

We find that TTNs are able to capture two-dimensional entanglement patterns more effectively than matrix product states (MPS) while being more efficient to contract than projected entangled pair states (PEPS) to probe larger systems and longer times. Structural optimization of the trees based on time evolution of the entanglement in the system allows to keep the necessary bond dimensions low and to maximally exploit the increased expressiveness of TTNs over MPS. In this way, we achieve more accurate results in all considered parameter regimes both below and above the ergodicity-to-localization crossover at a comparable compute-time cost.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p></details> |  |

While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+3 figures</p></details> |

Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications.</p></details> |  |

We compute the Green's function $G(r,τ)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,ω)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=π$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.</p></details> | 19 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Comparative study of plasmons in half-filled graphene via Quantum Monte Carlo and Random Phase Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20559v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quantum vs thermal fluctuations in phase transitions of two-dimensional superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20476v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Theory of Scalable Spin Squeezing with Disordered Quantum Dipoles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19781v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures + 20 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Quantum decay of magnons in the unfrustrated honeycomb Heisenberg model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19162v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the physical properties of elementary magnon excitations of the ordered antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, series expansions (SE), and continuous similarity transformations (CST). The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the "roton minimum" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Loop Algorithm for Quantum Transverse Ising Model in a Longitudinal Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17835v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum transverse Ising model and its extensions play a critical role in various fields, such as statistical physics, quantum magnetism, quantum simulations, and mathematical physics. Although it does not suffer from the sign problem in most cases, the corresponding quantum Monte Carlo algorithm performs inefficiently, especially at a large longitudinal field. The main hindrance is the lack of loop update method which can strongly decrease the auto-correlation between Monte Carlo steps. Here, we successfully develop a loop algorithm with a novel merge-unmerge process. It demonstrates a great advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithm when implementing it to simulate the Rydberg atom chain and Kagome qubit ice. This advanced algorithm suits various systems such as Rydberg atom arrays, trapped ions, quantum materials, and quantum annealers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, comments are welcome, and more information at http://cqutp.org/users/xfzhang/</p></details> |
| **[Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06284v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo studies of U(1) lattice gauge models of Kondo breakdown](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17801v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the local-moment regime, heavy fermions are most economically described by a compact U(1) gauge theory. With this formulation of the Kondo lattice, we study a spin chain coupled to two-dimensional Dirac conduction electrons. The spin chain is described by fermionic partons carrying spin and U(1) gauge charge. The heavy-fermion quasiparticle is a bound state of a U(1) matter field carrying unit electric and U(1) gauge charge, and the fermionic parton. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify two symmetry-equivalent regimes: a heavy-fermion metal with a sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust low-frequency transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with an incoherent resonance and vanishing low-frequency transport. For any finite lattice extent in the direction perpendicular to the chain, the Luttinger volume of the heavy-fermion phase counts both composite and conduction electrons, while in the Kondo-breakdown phase it counts only the conduction electrons. The evolution of the composite-fermion spectrum, dynamical spin structure factor, and optical conductivity provides a nonperturbative demonstration of gauge-mediated Kondo breakdown and establishes transport fingerprints of an orbital-selective Mott transition in the context of U(1) gauge theories of heavy fermions.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures plus supplemental material (16 pages, 10 figures)</p></details> |

Total energies are calculated using various correlated methods: configuration interaction (CI), coupled-cluster (CC) up to perturbative quadruple excitations whenever feasible, and stochastic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches. In order to estimate the energy at the complete basis set (CBS) limit, the basis sets are constructed systematically through aug-cc-p(C)VnZ for each ccECP and further extrapolated to the CBS limit within the corresponding methods. Kinetic energies are evaluated at the FCI/CISD level to provide insights into the electron density and localization of the ccECPs. We also provide data sets for widely used diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to quantify fixed-node biases with single-reference trial wavefunctions. These comprehensive benchmarks validate the accuracy of ccECPs within the CC, CI, and QMC methodologies, thus providing accurate and tested valence-only Hamiltonians for many-body electronic structure calculations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Interfacial Strain Modulated Correlated Plasmons in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 and Their Role in High-temperature Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16417v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials remains a major challenge in physics due to the complexity of their strongly correlated electronic states. Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings. The collective evidence from both the experimental results and theoretical findings provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrupolar and dipolar phases of excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide trilayer heterostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15848v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments on trilayer transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have revealed the rich behavior of dipolar excitons. Motivated by these experimental observations, we investigate the collective dynamics of planar quantum dipoles whose orientation fluctuates due to charge tunneling between the outer layers. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons.</p></details> | 24 pages, 20 figures |
| **[The Bose-Hubbard polaron from weak to strong coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00486v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.</p></details> |  |

We make use of the Modified Periodic Coulomb potential formalism to account for the long-range character of the interaction, and explore a range of density corresponding to average interparticle separation $1 \le r_s\le 80$. We report numerical results based on simulations of system comprising up to 2304 particles. We find a superfluid ground state for $r_s$ as large as 70, i.e., significantly above the most recent numerical estimate of the Wigner crystallization threshold, which we estimate at $r_W \approx 71$. Furthermore, no thermally re-entrant crystalline phase nor any evidence of metastable bubbles is observed near the transition, in contrast with a previous theoretical study in which quantum statistics was neglected. The computed superfluid transition temperature depends remarkably weakly on density.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fourt...</summary><p>Fourteen pages, six figures in color</p></details> |

The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Here, we investigate the accuracy of such bound in the strongly interacting regime, where the mean-field approach fails. Combining quantum Monte Carlo, Gross-Pitaevskii equation and field-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the bound serves as a reliable estimator of the superfluid fraction for strongly interacting bosons at 2D-1D dimensional crossover at low temperatures. By further presenting two counterexamples where the bound predicts trivial results, we shed light on the conditions under which the Leggett's bound serves as a good predictor.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

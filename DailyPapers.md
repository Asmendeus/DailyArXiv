| **[Superconductivity in Substitutional Ga-Hyperdoped Ge Epitaxial Thin Films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15421v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Doping-induced superconductivity in group IV elements may enable quantum functionalities in material systems accessible with well-established semiconductor technologies. Non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group III atoms into C, Si, or Ge can yield superconductivity; however, its origin is obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films and trilayer heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations ($n_\textup{h} = 4.15 \times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-3}$, ~17.9\% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of $T_{\textup{c}} = 3.5$~K and an out-of-plane critical field of 1~T at 270~mK. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a narrow band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor platform.</p></details> |  |

Multicomponent superconductors, particularly ones breaking multiple symmetries, are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. Here we show that even, nominally $single$-component superconductors under certain conditions are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. We consider nearest-neighbor pairing interactions on a square lattice that leads to $s$-wave and $d$-wave representations of link superconducting order parameter. We show that even if the subdominant order parameter is completely suppressed in the ground state, it results in multiple correlation lengths with nontrivial hierarchy, resulting in important physical consequences in inhomogeneous solutions. Under certain conditions, this leads to type-1.5 superconductivity, where magnetic field penetration length falls between two coherence lengths, leading to vortex clustering in an external magnetic field.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures (Supplementary 11 pages, 4 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Optical Properties of Superconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ Single Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11123v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optical properties of the superconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ single crystals with a critical temperature $T_c\approx 26$ K have been measured in the {\it ab} plane in a wide frequency range using both infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry at temperatures of 4--300 K. The normal-state reflectance of K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ is analyzed using a Drude-Lorentz model with one Drude component. The temperature dependences of the plasma frequency, optical conductivity, scattering rate, and dc resistivity of the Drude contribution in the normal state are presented. In the superconducting state, we observe a signature of the superconducting gap opening at $2Δ$(5~K) = 11.8~meV. An abrupt decrease in the low-frequency dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon _1(ω)$ at $T < T_c$ also evidences the formation of the superconducting condensate. The superconducting plasma frequency $ω_{pl,s} = (213\pm 5)$~cm$^{-1}$ and the magnetic penetration depth $λ=(7.5\pm 0.2)$~$μ$m at $T=5$~K are determined.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[The True Parent Phase of K1.9Fe4.2Se5: A Stripe-type Orthorhombic Phase Requiring a Superconducting Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10443v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The origin of the four-fold Tc amplification in A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 (>30 K) compared to FeSe (8 K) remains a central puzzle, complicated by a debate over the true superconducting (SC) parent phase--the I4/m (245) insulating matrix or a supposed I4/mmm metallic phase. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel "stripe-type orthorhombic phase" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state. This discovery of a two-step transition--formation of a stripe parent phase, followed by a superconducting distortion--provides a new mechanism for Tc amplification via controlled heterogeneity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 main figures.

| **[Perfect displacement of a superconducting resonator via fast-forward scaling theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11056v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the fast-forward and time-scaling properties of superconducting resonators under a coherent drive. We propose a scheme for perfect displacement of a superconducting resonator by modulating the drive amplitude based on fast-forward scaling theory. Furthermore, we propose a scheme exploiting both the fast-forward and time-scaling properties that enables perfect displacement through detuning modulation. The proposed schemes are also applicable to a subsystem that can be effectively represented by a driven resonator. In particular, we apply the latter scheme to fast and high-fidelity displacement of a coupler between Kerr parametric oscillators.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Stable and Efficient Charging of Superconducting Capacitively Shunted Flux Quantum Batteries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07464v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum batteries, as miniature energy storage devices, have sparked significant research interest in recent years. However, achieving rapid and stable energy transfer in quantum batteries while obeying quantum speed limits remains a critical challenge. In this work, we experimentally optimize the charging process by leveraging the unique energy level structure of a superconducting capacitively-shunted flux qubit, using counterdiabatic pulses in the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. Compared to previous studies, we impose two different norm constraints on the driving Hamiltonian, achieving optimal charging without exceeding the overall driving strength. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a charging process that achieves the quantum speed limit. In addition, we introduce a dimensionless parameter $\mathcal{S}$ to unify charging speed and stability, offering a universal metric for performance optimization. In contrast to metrics such as charging power and thermodynamic efficiency, the $\mathcal{S}$ criterion quantitatively captures the stability of ergentropy while also considering the charging speed. Our results highlight the potential of the capacitively-shunted qubit platform as an ideal candidate for realizing three-level quantum batteries and deliver novel strategies for optimizing energy transfer protocols.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Raman fingerprint of high-temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10784v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-rich compounds under extreme pressures has prompted great excitement, intense research, but also debate over the past decade. Electrical transport has been the primary diagnostic tool for identifying superconductivity in these systems, whereas complementary probes, including magnetic, spectroscopic, tunnelling and ultrafast methods, remain mostly qualitative due to experimental constraints and sample heterogeneity. Recent concerns over their reliability have fuelled controversy, leading to scepticism and pointing out the need for alternative, quantitative approaches. In this study, we acquired unprecedented high-quality Raman spectra of hexagonal LaH10 at approximately 145 GPa and low temperatures, in conjunction with electrical transport measurements. Upon cooling, we observe a drop of resistivity and simultaneous remarkable variations of phonon frequencies and linewidths. These effects are interpreted and perfectly reproduced by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, providing a definitive proof of phonon-mediated superconductivity and enabling a quantitative determination of the superconducting energy gap. Our results establish Raman spectroscopy as a robust, contact-free probe with micrometric resolution for studying high temperature superconductivity, opening a powerful route to its discovery and characterization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardware-Efficient Bosonic Module for Entangling Superconducting Quantum Processors via Optical Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10407v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling superconducting quantum processors beyond single dilution refrigerators requires efficient optical interconnects, yet integrating microwave-to-optical (M2O) transducers poses challenges due to frequency mismatches and qubit decoherence. We propose a modular architecture using SNAIL-based parametric coupling to interface Brillouin M2O transducers with long-lived 3D cavities, while maintaining plug-and-play compatibility. Through numerical simulations incorporating realistic noises, including laser heating, propagation losses, and detection inefficiency, we demonstrate raw entangled bit fidelities of F~0.8 at kHz-level rates over 30 km using the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol. Implementing asymmetric entanglement pumping tailored to amplitude damping errors, we achieve purified fidelities F~0.94 at 0.2 kHz rates. Our cavity-based approach outperforms transmon schemes, providing a practical pathway for distributed superconducting quantum computing.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Microwave Dressed States and Vacuum Fluctuations in a Superconducting Condensate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10364v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microwave dressed states are found to emerge within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field due to photon-Cooper pair entanglement. The renormalized energy separation between these states exceeds the prediction of BCS theory, with the enhancement depending on the number of photons and also arising from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Our work introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding the theoretical description beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. We further demonstrate that the superconducting condensate exerts a back-action on the electromagnetic field, suppressing electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state. This result is consistent with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02405v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps,while the electron-phonon interaction time decreases, with the magnitude of change depending on temperature and sample batch.TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Three-dimensional flat bands and possible interlayer triplet pairing superconductivity in the alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moiré bulk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09109v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moiré superlattices hosting flat bands and correlated states have emerged as a focal topic in condensed matter research. Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moiré bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moiré bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31°. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moiré bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moiré bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moiré bulk systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Liquid metal printing for superconducting circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09705v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting circuits are a promising platform for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum limited amplifiers, ultra-low power superconducting electronics, and sensors with ultimate sensitivity. Typically, circuit fabrication is realized by standard nanolithography, generally associated with a high level of control over defects and contaminants. Additive approaches have not been used so far since they are expected to be inferior in terms of superconducting properties or quantum coherence. This work shows that liquid-metal based micro-pipette printing is suited for fabricating superconducting lumped-element resonators with high internal quality factors. The applicability of our technique for low-loss superconducting device fabrication and the possibility to locally add metal structures, without affecting any preexisting circuit elements, is a further advantage. Our results open up new avenues in the hardware implementation of scaled-up superconducting quantum computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Green Function Invariants for Floquet Topological Superconductivity Induced by Proximity Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09650v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $π$ modes.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 6 appendices; Editor's Pick in APL Quantum; Published in the Special Collection: Quantum Dynamics in Theory, Numerics and in Experimental Research; Submitted 18 July 2025; Accepted 24 October 2025; Published online 10 November 2025</p></details> |
| **[The superconducting diode effect in Josephson junctions fabricated from structurally chiral Mo$_3$Al$_2$C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11629v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect occurs in superconducting materials in which both spin and inversion symmetry are broken. The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries. Thus a Josephson junction interface with the left-handed structure on one side of the junction and the right-handed structure on the other should exhibit a diode effect. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of right-handed/left-handed and right-handed/right-handed devices fabricated from single crystals of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. Fraunhofer-like magnetic diffraction patterns confirm the presence of Josephson effect in all but one of our devices. A magnetic field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in the right-handed/left-handed devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $I_{c-}$, with a maximum asymmetry of 5\%. The intrinsic superconducting diode effect is not observed in the right-handed/right-handed devices. We provide an explanation for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-momentum pairing and superlattice superconductivity in valley-imbalanced rhombohedral graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15471v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a `valley-independent Chern number', measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[First-principles evidence for conventional superconductivity in a quasicrystal approximant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09224v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasicrystals (QCs) host long-range order without translational symmetry, a regime in which the very foundations of BCS theory are not straightforwardly applicable, yet experiments on QCs and their approximant crystals (ACs) point to conventional, $s$-wave, electron-phonon coupled superconductivity. With this work we directly address this seeming contradiction from first principles. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute the superconducting properties of the recently discovered AC Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and quantitatively reproduce its bulk $T_\text{c}$. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first \emph{ab initio} determination of $T_\text{c}$ for an AC and establishes that the electron-phonon framework is predictive in these systems as well. Using the generalized quasichemical approximation for alloy modeling in the decagonal Al-Os family, we predict tunable superconductivity in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Re$_x$ and Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Ir$_x$; in particular, Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ is dynamically stable and estimated to have a $T_\text{c}$ about 30% above Al$_{13}$Os$_4$. Finally, we argue that $T_\text{c}$ obtained for ACs provides practical bounds for the $T_\text{c}$ of their parent QCs, suggesting that the quasicrystalline counterparts of Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ could harbor the highest $T_\text{c}$ among QCs yet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electromagnetic Feature Extraction in Superconducting Quantum Circuits: An Open-Source Finite-Element Workflow Using Palace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09041v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electromagnetic (EM) feature extraction, including element characterization, eigenmodes, and field distributions, is essential for superconducting quantum circuit design. To streamline this process, we present a workflow built around Palace, an open-source, high-performance finite element method solver tailored for quantum applications. Starting from circuit layouts, the workflow automates mesh generation, multiple EM solver processing, and EM-to-Hamiltonian post-processing. We benchmark the workflow on a chip with bare resonators and qubits coupled with readout resonators, achieving resonator frequencies prediction within 0.3% and 3 out of 4 external couplings within 16% of cryogenic measurements. These results demonstrate open-source EM tools can match commercial accuracy while offering scalable, license-free analysis. Our Palace-based workflow provides an accessible and extensible foundation for rapid superconducting circuit development and materials-loss studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stability, electronic disruption, and anisotropic superconductivity of hydrogenated trilayer metal tetraborides (MB$_{4}$H; M=Be, Mg, Ca, Al)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09009v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity in MgB$_2$ (\(T_c = 39\) K) \cite{nagamatsu2001superconductivity} established metal diborides (MB$_2$) as a promising class of conventional superconductors. Recent advances in fabrication techniques have enabled the synthesis of 2D MgB$_2$ with a \(T_c\) of 36 K \cite{cheng2018fabrication}, reigniting interest in layered metal borides. This has led to predictions of superconductivity in various 2D metal borides, including MB$_4$ (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Al), with CaB$_4$ exhibiting the highest estimated \(T_c\) of 36.1 K. To explore the impact of hydrogenation on superconductivity, we systematically investigate two-dimensional hydrogenated trilayer metal borides (MB$_4$H; M = Be, Mg, Ca, Al). Our results reveal that these materials retain a metallic nature dominated by boron \(p\)-orbitals, while hydrogenation significantly alters their band dispersion and Fermi surface topology. Phonon calculations confirm their dynamical stability and reveal strong electron-phonon interactions, leading to multi-gap superconductivity. Among the studied compounds, MgB$_4$H, AlB$_4$H, and CaB$_4$H exhibit possible two superconducting gaps, with CaB$_4$H showing the strongest electron-phonon coupling, resulting in an intrinsic superconducting transition temperature of 64 K. In contrast, AlB$_4$H shows the weakest coupling, with \(T_c = 22\) K. The calculated electron-phonon coupling constants (\(λ\)) range from 0.62 to 0.99, demonstrating the tunability of superconducting properties through elemental substitution. These findings provide valuable insights into superconductivity in hydrogenated metal borides and highlight their potential for high-\(T_c\) applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

We present a detailed analysis of the normal-state electronic structure and the self-consistent results. Our findings indicate that the selection of hybrid pairings is governed by distinct surface Fermi-arc configurations: specifically, $s$-wave pairing dominates on the bottom surface, while $p$-wave pairing prevails on the top. Furthermore, the emergent superconducting state is a second-order topological superconductors with hinge states in the system. Our results identify type-II time-reversal-invariant Weyl semimetals as a promising intrinsic platform for realizing unconventional and topological superconductivity.</p></details> |  |

| **[Competition of fermion pairing, magnetism, and charge order in the spin-doped attractive Hubbard gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10605v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tension between fermion pairing and magnetism affects numerous strongly correlated electron systems, from high-temperature cuprates to twisted bilayer graphene. Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Interplay between Hubbard interaction and charge transfer energy in three-orbital Emery model: implication on cuprates and nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11028v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the numerically unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to systematically investigate the three-orbital Emery model in the normal state in a wide range of local interactions, charge transfer energy, and doping levels. We focus on the influence of the onsite Hubbard $U_{dd}$ and the charge transfer energy scale $ε_p$ on the electronic properties via the orbital occupancies, local moments, spin correlations, and spectral properties. Rich features of the orbital-resolved local and momentum-dependent spectra are revealed to associate with the possible Zhang-Rice singlet (ZRS) breakdown reflected by the peak splitting near the Fermi level in the heavily overdoped regime. Moreover, the pseudogap features at a small charge transfer energy scale (relevant to cuprates) are shown to diminish at larger $ε_p$, which implies the weakening or absence of the pseudogap in the infinite-layer nickelates. Besides, an optimal value of $ε_p$ is identified for maximizing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin correlations. Our large-scale simulations provide new insights on the well-established Emery model, particularly in the regime of heavily overdoped and/or large charge transfer energy scale.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Functional renormalization group study of a dissipative Bose--Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09643v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional dissipative Bose-Hubbard model using the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (FRG). Each lattice site is coupled to an independent bath, generating long-range temporal interactions that encode non-Markovian dissipation. For a broad class of bath spectra -- ohmic, sub-ohmic, and super-ohmic -- we identify two competing low-energy regimes: a Luttinger-liquid line of fixed points and a dissipative fixed point characterized by finite compressibility, vanishing superfluid stiffness, and universal scaling exponents, separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The FRG framework is essential here, as it provides access to the complete renormalization group flow and all fixed points from a single microscopic action, beyond the reach of perturbative or variational methods. This work establishes a unified and systematically improvable framework for describing dissipative quantum phases in one dimension.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[The pseudogap and strange metal states in the square-lattice Hubbard model: a comprehensive study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07726v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To clarify the origin of the pseudogap and strange metal states as well as their mutual relationship in cuprate superconductors, a comprehensive study on the spectral function, Fermi surface, resistivity and dynamical spin susceptivity of the Hubbard model on the square lattice has been conducted by means of the ladder dual-fermion approximation with an electron self-energy correction. It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $ω/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled.</p></details> | 33 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model revealed by neural quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07566v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whether the ground state of the square lattice Hubbard model exhibits superconductivity remains a major open question, central to understanding high temperature cuprate superconductors and ultra-cold fermions in optical lattices. Numerical studies have found evidence for stripe-ordered states and superconductivity at strong coupling but the phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we show that one can resolve the subtle energetics of metallic, superconducting, and stripe phases using a new class of neural quantum state (NQS) wavefunctions that extend hidden fermion determinant states to Pfaffians. We simulate several hundred electrons using fast Pfaffian algorithms allowing us to measure off-diagonal long range order. At strong coupling and low hole-doping, we find that a non-superconducting filled stripe phase prevails, while superconductivity coexisting with partially-filled stripes is stabilized by a negative next neighbor hopping t-prime, with |t-prime| > 0.1. At larger doping levels, we introduce momentum-space correlation functions to mitigate finite size effects that arise from weakly-bound pairs. These provide evidence for uniform d-wave superconductivity at U = 4, even when t-prime = 0. Our results highlight the potential of NQS approaches, and provide a fresh perspective on superconductivity in the square lattice Hubbard model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Green's Functions of Strongly Correlated Hubbard Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07252v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that a machine learning framework based on kernel ridge regression can encode and predict the self-energy of one-dimensional Hubbard models using only mean-field features such as static and dynamic Hartree-Fock quantities and first-order GW calculations. This approach is applicable across a wide range of on-site Coulomb interaction strengths $U/t$, ranging from weakly interacting systems ($U/t \ll 1$) to strong correlations ($U/t > 8$). The predicted self-energy is transformed via Dyson's equation and analytic continuation to obtain the real-frequency Green's function, which allows access to the spectral function and density of states. This method can be used for nearest-neighbor interactions $t$ and long-range hopping terms $t'$, $t''$, and $t'''$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-reciprocal spin-wave excitations in Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03997v2)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnet on a square lattice. Our study reveals that the propagation of spin-wave excitations exhibit non-reciprocal behavior, i.e., spin waves traveling in opposite directions display asymmetry in energy dispersion $ω({\bf q}) \ne ω(-{\bf q)}$, which also results in an asymmetric behavior of group velocity, spin stiffness, etc. We find that this asymmetric behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned inside the atomic plane, while the excitations remain symmetric for out-of-plane magnetization. The first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear. However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[SC$^*$ Superconductivity and Spin Stiffnesses in the SU(2) Gauge Theory of the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03436v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the SU(2) gauge theory for spin fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, where the electron field is fractionalized in terms of spinons and chargons. In this theory, spinons are described by a non-linear sigma model, while chargons are treated as fermions at a mean-field level. We investigate the instability to a superconducting state SC*, arising from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) where pairing between chargons occurs. Consistent with previous studies, our analysis reveals a coexisting phase characterized by both magnetic and superconducting order for the chargons. The central contribution of this work is the calculation of the feedback of superconductivity on spatial and temporal spin stiffnesses, thereby quantifying its impact on spin fluctuations. Our key finding is that superconductivity significantly suppresses these spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin fluctuations. This enhancement suggests that superconductivity can play a crucial role in stabilizing quantum disorder against long-range magnetic ordering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonpertubative Many-Body Theory for the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model at Low Temperature: From Weak to Strong Coupling Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12468v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prevents continuous symmetry breaking at any finite temperature, thus forbidding a Landau phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$. The difficulty arises when many-body theoretical studies predict a Landau phase transition at finite temperatures, which contradicts the Mermin-Wagner theorem and is termed a pseudo phase transition. To tackle this problem, we systematically develop a symmetrization scheme, defined as averaging physical quantities over all symmetry-breaking states, thus ensuring that it preserves the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We apply the symmetrization scheme to the GW-covariance calculation for the 2D repulsive Hubbard model at half-filling in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime and at low temperatures, obtaining the one-body Green's function and spin-spin correlation function, and benchmark them against Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) with good agreement.The spin-spin correlation functions are approached within the covariance theory, a general method for calculating two-body correlation functions from a one-particle starting point, such as the GW formalism used here, which ensures the preservation of the fundamental fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) and Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI). With the FDR and WTI satisfied, we conjecture that the $χ$-sum rule, a fundamental relation from the Pauli exclusion principle, can be used to probe the reliability of many-body methods, and demonstrate this by comparing the GW-covariance and mean-field-covariance approaches. This work provides a novel framework to investigate the strong-coupling and doped regime of the 2D Hubbard model, which is believed to be applicable to real high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors.</p></details> | 44 pages, 11 figures |

Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures and appendix</p></details> |

In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+11 ...</summary><p>7+11 pages, 4+7 figures</p></details> |

Using the hopping integrals and on-site potentials obtained by fitting the DFT band structures, we map a quantum phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model with increasing pressure in a ladder geometry, which has an intermediate Hubbard repulsion and a Hund's coupling. Near $3/8$ filling, we find a strong spin density wave order, which at $3/8$ filling shows a real-space spin pattern similar to the spin-charge stripe order along a lattice direction. At $21/64$ filling, we find a superconducting phase with interlayer superconductivity (SC) in both the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as in-plane SC in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Intriguingly, the SC is weakened with increasing pressure and transits to a Luttinger liquid above $80$ GPa, which qualitatively agrees with the experimental observations of decreasing $T_c$ with increasing pressure and a transition to Fermi liquid above $80$ GPa in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparative study, we further show that the ratio of interaction to hopping integral, which reduces moderately with increasing pressure, may play a dominant role in the weakening of SC. Our results of this experimentally relevant model not only find a robust SC through suppressing the competing spin density wave order, but also give new insight into the unusual pressure dependence of SC in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.</p></details> |  |

Upon chemical doping, two distinct types of excitonic ferromagnetism have been reported. Using steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that photo-doped half-filled systems can host nonthermal counterparts of these excitonic phases and exhibit a rich phase diagram in the space of photo-doping and crystal field splitting. Photo-doping a spin-triplet excitonic insulator provides a route towards nonequilibrium control of magnetic order.</p></details> |  |

However, its potential for quantum thermodynamic applications remains largely uncharted. Here, we study a quantum Otto heat engine whose working substance is a system governed by the Dicke-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Through the research on steady-state superradiance phase transitions, it is demonstrated that the steady-state synergistic mechanism under high and low temperature environments is the reason for the emergence of high-performance heat engines. By analyzing the influences of atom-light coupling strength, inter-cavity hopping strength and atom number on the working modes of quantum Otto cycle, it is clarified that the effective working regions of each working mode. This work has established a close connection between superradiance phase transition and the quantum thermodynamic applications. It not only deepens our understanding of the energy conversion mechanism in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics but also lays a theoretical foundation for the future experimental design of high-performance quantum Otto heat engines.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Recent time-resolved spectroscopies indicate a coupling between the CDW amplitude mode and the electronic correlation strength, yet the role of the screened Coulomb interaction remains unclear. Using the constrained random-phase approximation, we show that the CDW amplitude modifies the bare and screened on-site interactions, leading to sizable variations in the effective Hubbard U. Our combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal that the Hubbard bands shift in concert with the CDW amplitude, and that a reduced distortion drives a transition from a Mott insulator to a correlated metal. These results demonstrate a direct link between lattice distortions and Coulomb interactions in transition-metal dichalcogenides, providing a microscopic mechanism for light-induced control of correlated phases in two-dimensional quantum materials.</p></details> |  |

Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p></details> | 98 pages, 75 figures |

In equilibrium, the system exhibits commensurate charge correlations consistent with the superlattice periodicity. Under laser excitation, the charge correlation function exhibits distinct behaviors across four representative frequencies, spanning both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. Notably, we observe a laser-induced commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in the charge order, manifested by a shift in the peak wavevector of the charge structure factor. This transition is driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon dynamics, where the laser frequency and intensity determine whether excitations predominantly destabilize the charge order on the weakly or strongly interacting sublattice. Our analysis of the excitation spectrum and site-resolved correlation dynamics reveals the underlying mechanisms of this transition. These results suggest a promising optical strategy for controlling charge order in superlattice-based quantum materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Within the higher-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, we find that there is no apparent finite-size boundary drift between the thermal phase and the many-body localized regime. We substantiate this observation by introducing the Van Vleck perturbation theory into the field of many-body localization. The appropriateness of this method rests largely on the peculiar Hilbert-space structure enabled by the particles' Bose statistics. The situation is reversed in the lower-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, where the significant finite-size boundary drift pushes the putative many-body localized regime up to the greater disorder strengths. We utilize the algebraic projection method to make a connection linking the disordered Bose-Hubbard model in the lower-energy section to an intricate disordered spin chain model. This issue of the finite-size drift could hence be analogous to what happens in the disordered Heisenberg chain. Both trends might be traced back to the particles' intrinsic or emergent single-occupancy constraint like the spin-$1/2$, hard-core boson, or spinless fermion degrees of freedom.</p></details> | 9 pages + 4 figures |

These results are supported by numerical calculations of the density-density correlation in the quench dynamics for $N=2,3,4,$ and $6$.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures (Supplemental Material: 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |

In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($δ\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity in a bilayer $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07545v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $δ= 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $δ= 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator.

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Through state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations using the grand canonical ensemble, we address open issues regarding the ground-state phase diagram of the extended $t\text{-}J$ model on a square lattice in the parameter regime relevant to cuprate superconductors. On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure $t\text{-}J$ model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of doping ($δ=0.1-0.2$), hosts robust d-wave superconductivity possibly coexisting with weak unidirectional pair density wave. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping $t_2$ suppresses pair and charge density waves, resulting in a uniform d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems. Our work validates the $t\text-J$ model as a proper minimum model for the emergence of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.</p></details> |  |

While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures with supplemental materials</p></details> |

Here, we address this by synthesizing high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$) with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice, particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$ rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm 2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the $c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/Å, demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Here we propose to broadly expand the choices of materials platforms to achieve high-Tc superconducting La3Ni2O7 films by proposing designer substrates of Ba1-xSrxO (x = 0 - 1) that allow to continuously tune the strain in the films from being tensile to compressive. Our systematic study of the structural and electronic reconstructions of the strained La3Ni2O7 bilayer film leads to the central finding that at the optimal tensile strain of ~2% (x ~0.25), the spectral weight of the Ni dz2 orbital is peaked right at the Fermi level, and its hybridization with the Ni dx2-y2 orbital is substantially enhanced. Consequently, the expected Tc should be unprecedentedly high, at least substantially higher than those achieved in the compressive regime. Furthermore, our detailed thickness-dependent energetic analyses show that such films can be stably grown for thicknesses equal to or beyond the bilayer regime, and predict that the SrO-terminated SrTiO3 should also be able to stabilize the films with optimal tensile strain and higher Tc's.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the superconducting gap amplitude and symmetry, the key parameters to characterize a superconductor, remain elusive due to the overwhelming challenges of gap studies under high pressure. Here, we introduce in situ directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation, differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors. These findings set stringent constraints on theoretical models for nickelate superconductors and establish a robust spectroscopic approach for understanding superconductors under extreme pressures.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 4 supplementary figures</p></details> |

Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_2$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have reported superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-delta under pressure, with zero-resistance near 80 K, though the Meissner effect remains debated due to low superconducting volume fractions and limited high-pressure magnetic measurement techniques. In this work, we use diamond quantum sensors and four-probe detection to observe both zero resistance and the Meissner effect in the same La3Ni2O7-delta single crystal. By mapping the Meissner effect, we visualized superconducting regions and revealed sample inhomogeneities. Our combined magnetic and electrical measurements on the same crystal provide dual evidence of superconductivity, supporting the high-temperature superconductivity of La3Ni2O7-delta.

Our numerical calculations indicate that interlayer pairing is dominant, resulting in an $s_\pm$-wave symmetry. We propose employing perpendicular electric fields, a practical method in thin film systems, to verify the pairing symmetry. Our calculations predict that such fields will induce Fermi arcs or nodal points and significantly modulate the gap near the diagonal, with the modulated region overlapping the area probed by ARPES. This approach provides an effective tool for probing pairing symmetry in bilayer nickelate thin films, especially given current limitations in experimental techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, including the supplemental material</p></details> |

Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule. These results suggest that the normal state of La3Ni2O7 to be a multiband metallic nature.</p></details> |  |

Using density functional theory calculations, we elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ by comprehensively analyzing structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics. Consistent with recent scanning transmission electron microscopy observations, we find an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at $-0.9\%$ strain, preceding superconductivity onset. Electronic analysis shows compressive strain lowers Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital energy levels, while interfacial Sr diffusion effectively reconstructs the $d_{z^2}$ pockets, quantitatively matching angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. The interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\perp$ under pressure or strain closely tracks experimental superconducting $T_c$ variation. The dome-shaped pressure dependence and monotonic strain dependence of $J_\perp$ mainly arise from modulations in the apical oxygen $p_z$ energy levels. Moreover, compressive strain suppresses both charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities analogous to pressure effects, with SDW vanishing concurrently with the structural transition and CDW disappearing at $\sim-3.3\%$ strain. Our results indicate that suppressed density waves and enhanced $J_\perp$ are crucial for both strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity. Accordingly, we propose several candidate substrates capable of achieving greater compressive strain, thereby potentially increasing $T_c$.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

In this respect, Sr-Ni-O RP-type phases represent alternative systems that exist with partial cation substitution. We demonstrate that by Y-doping in Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (SNAO), as Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (YSNAO), the drawback of an insulating ground state is overcome, and a significant decrease in resistivity is achieved with crystals exhibiting semiconducting behavior. We employ optical floating zone (OFZ) growth at 10 bar oxygen partial pressure to explore the phase formation in a narrow region of Y-Sr-Ni-Al-O and investigate via DFT the general stability of the pure Sr-Ni-O scenario. Using extensive diffraction and spectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the structural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and reduced compounds were investigated. The optimal growth of YSNAO allows for large high quality crystals suitable for neutron studies. In the Al-free growth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-δ}$, from which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed, opening the door for future exploration of \textit{A}-site substituted RP-type phases without Ni-site disorder.</p></details> |  |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity. Our findings indicate that interlayer Coulomb interactions are crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.</p></details> |  |

However, while zero resistance state has been observed, experimental characterization of the superconducting properties of pressurized nickelates is still limited and experimentally challenging. Here, we present the first full temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 measurement in La4Ni3O10 single crystal, achieved by combining high magnetic field and high-pressure techniques. Remarkably, the Hc2 of La4Ni3O10 is nearly isotropic, with the anisotropic parameter monotonically increasing from 1.4 near Tc to 1 at lower temperatures. By analyzing the Hc2 using the two-band model, we uncover that the anisotropic diffusivity of the bands, primarily originating from d(z2 ) and d(x2-y2 ) orbitals, is well compensated, resulting in an unusually isotropic superconducting state. These findings provide critical experimental evidence that underscores the significant role of the d(z2 ) orbital in enabling superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

It is believed that the density wave (DW) at ~150 K plays an important role in SC emergence, but its nature remains largely underexplored. Here, we utilized temperature-dependent in-situ Ni K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to probe the Ni-3d/4p electronic states of La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta samples down to 4.8 K, enabling us to witness the evolution of both in-plane d_(x^2-y^2)/p_x (p_y) and out-of-plane d_(3z^2-r^2)/p_z orbitals of NiO6 octahedron across the DW transition. Main edge energy associated with Ni 4p orbital shows an anomalous decline near DW transition, signifying the occurrence of lattice distortions as a hallmark of charge density wave. Below DW transition, the enlarged crystal field splitting (CFS) indicates an enhanced NiO6 octahedral distortion. Intriguingly, magnetic Pr substituents could activate the mutual interplay of d_(x^2-y^2) and d_(3z^2-r^2) orbitals. We discussed its relevance to the favored bulk SC in the pressurized polycrystalline La2PrNi2O7-delta than pristine.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Despite intense research, determination of the exact oxygen content and understanding of the relationship between superconductivity and oxygen content remain a big challenge. Here, we report a systematical study on the structure and physical properties of La3Ni2O7-d polycrystalline powders which were prepared using sol-gel method at ambient pressure and then annealed under various oxygen pressure. We found that high pO2 annealing with slow cooling results in a new phase, which can be modeled using the hybrid single-layer-trilayer La3Ni2O7 or the tetragonal bilayer La3Ni2O7. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed significant single layers and trilayers after high oxygen pressure annealing, evidencing damage of the bilayer structure. The superconducting transition under high pressure became weak for high pO2 annealed samples, which is consistent with the damage of the bilayer structure. Our results reveal that the bilayer structure is fragile and post-annealing under near atmosphere pressure of oxygen is suitable to maintain bilayer structure and increase oxygen content at the same time.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

We find significant hardening of optical Ni-O bond-stretching phonons when going from non-magnetic to paramagnetic state, and increasing Coulomb interaction will make them even harder. The electron correlation is found to be sensitive to the Ni-O bond-stretching distortions, indicating strong interplay between electron correlation and lattice. We find that the strong local electron correlation will not favor charge orders that couple to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons, in support of the recent experiment that a $3a_0$ charge order is absent in the infinite-layer nickelates. Our results emphasize that the effects of local magnetic fluctuations should be fully taken into account when describing the lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelates without long-range magnetic orders, and also provide evidence to ascribe the kink observed in the recent angle-resolved photoemission experiment to possible strong electron coupling to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Has b...</summary><p>Has been accepted for a publication in PRB</p></details> |

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15322v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $χ^b > χ^a > χ^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $χ^a > χ^c > χ^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Yin-Yang vortex on UTe2 (011) surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21506v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UTe2 is a promising candidate for spin-triplet superconductor, yet its exact superconducting order parameter remains highly debated. Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Electronic dimensionality of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15435v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in the heavy-fermion metal UTe2 survives the application of very high magnetic fields, presenting both an intriguing puzzle and an experimental challenge. The strong, non-perturbative influence of the magnetic field complicates the determination of superconducting order parameters in the high-field phases. Here, we report electronic transport anisotropy measurements in precisely aligned microbars in magnetic fields to 45 T applied along the b-axis. Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter. A pair-density-wave-like state at high fields could naturally induce a layered modulation of the superfluid density, forming planar structures that confine vortices and guide their sliding in the flux-flow regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surface charge density wave in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12505v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</p></details> |  |

In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band (TSB), which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor, and also distinguish a chiral from non-chiral $Δ_k$ via enhanced s-wave proximity. Here we employ s-wave superconductive scan-tips and detect intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging reveals sub-gap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a-axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity, signifies that $Δ_k$ of UTe2 is a non-chiral state: B1u, B2u or B3u. However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a-axis is internodal, then a non-chiral B3u state is the most consistent for UTe2.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 figures, to appear in Science (2025)</p></details> |

In Kondo lattice systems, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon Knight shift have proven to be particularly sensitive to the properties of the developing heavy-electron fluid. Here we report muon Knight shift measurements on high-quality UTe2 single crystals grown by a molten salt-flux method. Together with previous data from a single crystal grown by a chemical-vapor transport method, our results show the contribution of the heavy-electron liquid to the muon Knight shift increases below a crossover temperature T* ~ 30 K in accord with a universal scaling function of T/T* for heavy-fermion materials. An observed departure from this universal scaling below a temperature T ~ 12 K at certain muon stopping sites signifies a reversal of the Kondo hybridization and a relocalization of U 5f moments with an antiferromagnetic coupling. The preservation of universal scaling at a different muon site demonstrates a coexistence of itinerant and localized 5f electron states preceding the superconducting phase transition.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[High Field Superconducting Phases of Ultra Clean Single Crystal UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21689v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the magnetoresistance of high-quality single crystals of UTe2 with Tc=2.1K in high magnetic fields up to 36T, with the field direction between the b and c-axes. From the angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2, we found that the field-reentrant superconducting phase near H // b-axis extends up to a field angle (24 deg) from the b to c-axis, where another field-reentrant superconducting phase begins to appear above the metamagnetic transition field, Hm. Our results suggest that the field-reentrant superconductivity below Hm near the b-axis is closely related to the superconductivity above Hm when the field is tilted toward the c-axis. Superconductivity appears to be robust when the field direction is maintained perpendicular to the magnetization easy axis, implying that fluctuations boosting superconductivity may persist. At first glance, these findings resemble the field-reentrant (reinforced) superconductivity observed in ferromagnetic superconductors URhGe and UCoGe, where Ising-type ferromagnetic fluctuations play a crucial role. However, in UTe2, the fluctuations are more complex. The angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 contrasts with that of the initial slope of Hc2 near Tc, revealing the anisotropic field response of fluctuations. Thanks to the high-quality samples, quantum oscillations were detected for field directions close to the c-axis using magnetoresistance (Shubnikov-de Haas effect) and torque (de Haas-van Alphen effect) measurements. The angular dependence of frequencies is in good agreement with those observed previously using the field-modulation technique, confirming quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in J.

Though UTe2 is considered to be a heavy fermion material, only light-electron Fermi surfaces have been compellingly identified, while a possible heavy electron Fermi surface near the momentum space Z-point has been the subject of more speculative and incongruent interpretations based on density functional theory (DFT+U) and experimental measurements. Here we explore the DFT+U band structure within a tight binding model framework to identify emergence mechanisms for heavy fermion Fermi surfaces. Applying a Gutzweiller-like renormalization term to f-electron kinetics is found to distort the lowest energy f electron band from a saddle point to a local minimum at the Z-point, introducing a shallow Fermi pocket and greatly improving compatibility with recent experiments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Absence of a Bulk Thermodynamic Phase Transition to a Density Wave Phase in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14714v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competing and intertwined orders are ubiquitous in strongly correlated electron systems, such as the charge, spin, and superconducting orders in the high-Tc cuprates. Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements provide evidence for a charge density wave (CDW) that coexists with superconductivity in the heavy Fermion metal UTe2. This CDW persists up to at least 7.5 K and, as a CDW breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice, its disappearance is necessarily accompanied by thermodynamic phase transition. Here, we report high-precision thermodynamic measurements of the elastic moduli of UTe2. We observe no signature of a phase transition in the elastic moduli down to a level of 1 part in 10^7, strongly implying the absence of bulk CDW order in UTe2. We suggest that the CDW and associated pair density wave (PDW) observed by STM may be confined to the surface of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molten Salt Flux Liquid Transport Method for Ultra Clean Single Crystals UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12740v2)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various single crystal growth techniques are presented for the unconventional superconductor UTe2. The molten salt flux liquid transport (MSFLT) method is employed to grow high-quality and large single crystals, exhibiting a high residual resistivity ratio (RRR = 200-800). On the other hand, the Te self-flux and chemical vapor transport (CVT) method produces samples of lower quality. The MSFLT method is a hybrid approach that combines the molten salt flux (MSF) and CVT methods. One significant advantage is that the materials gradually crystallize at the relatively low temperature which is fixed during the main process. This might be crucial for preventing U deficiency and obtaining high-quality and large single crystals of UTe2. Many different single crystals obtained by different technique were characterized by resistivity, specific heat measurements. The superconducting transition temperature decreases with the residual resistivity, followed by the Abrikosov-Gor'kov pair breaking theory. The highest quality sample reaches Tc=2.1K. The residual gamma-value of specific heat for the highest quality sample is only 3 percents of the normal state gamma-value. The specific heat jump, Delta C/(gamma Tc) reaches about 2.7 for high quality samples, indicating a strong coupling superconductor. Furthermore, the magnetic susceptibility for the field along a-axis in a high quality single crystal does not show an up-turn behavior on cooling, which is consistent with the results of NMR Knight shift and muSR experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in J.

Braithwaite et al., Commun. Phys. 2, 147 (2019)]. The clarification of pairing mechanisms and symmetries of gap functions are essentially important for understanding the multiple-phase diagram. Since the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations with Ising-like anisotropy is suggested from measurements of magnetic susceptibilities and neutron scattering measurements, it is expected that the interplay between these spin fluctuations plays a crucial role in the emergence of the multiple superconducting phases. Motivated by these observations, we examine the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing mechanism, analyzing the linearized Eliashberg equations for an effective model of f-electron bands. It is found that the Ising-like ferromagnetic fluctuations stabilize spin-triplet pairings in either the Au or B3u states, whereas Ising-like antiferromagnetic fluctuations stabilize spin-triplet pairings in the B1u state. These results provide a plausible scenario elucidating the multiple superconducting phases under pressure.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

These excitations originate from the U $5f^2$ configuration, which is unexpected since the short Te2-Te2 distances exclude Te2 being 2-. By utilizing the photoionization cross-section dependence of the photoemission spectra in combination with band structure calculations, we infer that the stabilization of the U $5f^2$ configuration is due to the U $6d$ bonding states in the U-dimers acting as a charge reservoir.

In contrast to previous muSR studies of UTe2 single crystals grown by a chemical vapour transport (CVT) method, we find no evidence of magnetic clusters or electronic moments fluctuating slow enough to cause a discernible relaxation of the zero-field muSR asymmetry spectrum. Consequently, our measurements on MSF-grown single crystals rule out the generation of spontaneous magnetic fields in the bulk that would occur near impurities or lattice defects if the superconducting state of UTe2 breaks time-reversal symmetry. This result suggests UTe2 is characterized by a single-component superconducting order parameter.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

This heavy-fermion paramagnet was rapidly identified as a reference compound to study the interplay between magnetism and unconventional superconductivity with multiple degrees of freedom. The proximity to a ferromagnetic quantum phase transition was initially proposed as a driving force to triplet-pairing superconductivity. However, we find here that long-range incommensurate antiferromagnetic order is established under pressure. The propagation vector km = (0.07,0.33,1) of the antiferromagnetic phase is close to a wavevector where antiferromagnetic fluctuations have previously been observed at ambient pressure. These elements support that UTe2 is a nearly-antiferromagnet at ambient pressure. Our work appeals for theories modelling the evolution of the magnetic interactions and electronic properties, driving a correlated paramagnetic regime at ambient pressure to a long-range antiferromagnetic order under pressure. A deeper understanding of itinerant-f-electrons magnetism in UTe2 will be a key for describing its unconventional superconducting phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article: 17 pages, 4 figures, 64 references Supplementary Information: 6 pages, 6 figures, 7 references</p></details> |

In this work we use scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize the role of topological defects in the novel magnetic field induced disappearance of an intertwined charge density wave (CDW) in the heavy fermion superconductor, UTe2. By simultaneously imaging the amplitude and phase of the CDW order, we reveal pairs of topological defects with positive and negative phase winding. The pairs are directly correlated with a zero CDW amplitude and increase in number with increasing magnetic field. These observations can be captured by a Ginzburg Landau model of a uniform superconductor coexisting with a pair density wave. A magnetic field generates vortices of the superconducting and pair density wave order which can create topological defects in the CDW and induce the experimentally observed melting of the CDW at the upper critical field. Our work reveals the important role of magnetic field generated topological defects in the melting the CDW order parameter in UTe2 and provides support for the existence of a parent pair density wave order on the surface of UTe2.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 Pa...</summary><p>29 Pages, includes manuscript and supplemental information, 4 Main figures and 8 Supplemental Figures</p></details> |

Here we report the specific heat C(H,T) of a high-quality single crystal of UTe2 with a single specific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition temperature T_c {\approx} 2 K and a small zero-field residual Sommerfeld coefficient γ_0 = C/T (T=0) = 10 mJ/mol-K^2. We applied magnetic field up to 12 T along the three principal crystallographic axes of UTe2 to probe the nature of the superconducting state. The evolution of the residual Sommerfeld coefficient as a function of magnetic field, γ_0 (H), is highly anisotropic and reveals distinct regions. In magnetic field up to 4 T applied along a, b, and c axes, we find γ_0{\approx}α_i {\square}H, with i=a,b,c, as expected for an unconventional superconductor with nodes (zeros) of the superconducting order parameter on the Fermi surface. A pronounced kink in γ_0(H), however, is observed at roughly 4 T for field applied along both a and b axes, whereas a smooth change from square-root to linear behaviour is observed at 4 T for H//c. These results strongly indicate that a zero-field ground state is stable up to 4 T and undergoes a field-induced evolution above 4 T. {α_c} > {α_a} > {α_b}, indicating that the nodes in the low-field state are predominantly located in the vicinity of the a-b plane. The modification of the order parameter is strongest when field is applied in the a-b plane, which causes nodes to move away from the direction of the applied field. Both d_(B_2u)+id_(B_1u) and d_(B_2u)+id_(A_u) two-component order parameters can account for our observations, with d_(B_2u)+id_(B_1u) a more likely candidate. In either scenario, our measurements indicate that B_2u is the primary superconducting order parameter in UTe2.</p></details> |  |

The pairing symmetry of recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor UTe2 featuring an exceedingly large upper critical field has attracted a great deal of attention. Even though it is widely believed that UTe2 possesses an odd-parity, spin-triplet pairing symmetry, direct evidence for it is lacking, especially at zero or low magnetic fields. We report here the selection-rule results of Josephson coupling between In, an s-wave superconductor, and UTe2. The orientation dependence of the Josephson coupling suggests very strongly that UTe2 possess an odd-parity pairing state of B_1u in zero magnetic fields. We also report the formation of Andreev surface bound states on the (1-10) surface of UTe2.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[Classical algorithms for estimating expectation values in linear-optical circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12882v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a classical algorithm for approximating the expectation values of observables in linear-optical circuits with arbitrary product input states, achieving additive-error accuracy. This result indicates that current applications of photonic systems aimed at demonstrating practical quantum supremacy through expectation value estimation, such as photonic variational algorithms, may face challenges in attaining the computational advantage. It also implies the output probabilities of boson sampling with arbitrary product input states can be efficiently approximated by our method, resulting that boson sampling becomes efficiently simulable when its output probability distribution is polynomially sparse. We also develop an efficient classical algorithm for estimating transition amplitudes of arbitrary product states in linear-optical circuits. This provides additive-error approximation algorithms for matrix functions associated with linear-optical circuits, such as the (loop-)hafnian, which are of independent interest. As an application, it solves the generalized molecular vibronic spectra problem (Oh et al., 2024), previously suggested as a candidate for practical quantum advantage. Finally, we extend our framework to near-Clifford circuits, enabling classical approximation of their expectation values.</p></details> | 8+12 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Material-Based Intelligence: Self-organizing, Autonomous and Adaptive Cognition Embodied in Physical Substrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08838v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of intelligent materials often draws parallels with the complex adaptive behaviors of biological organisms, where robust functionality stems from sophisticated hierarchical organization and emergent long-distance coordination among a myriad local components. Current synthetic materials, despite integrating advanced sensors and actuators, predominantly demonstrate only simple, pre-programmed stimulus-response functionalities, falling short of robustly autonomous intelligent behavior. These systems typically execute tasks determined by rigid design or external control, fundamentally lacking the intricate internal feedback loops, dynamic adaptation, self-generated learning, and genuine self-determination characteristic of biological agents. This perspective proposes a fundamentally different approach focusing on architectures where material-based intelligence is not pre-designed, but arises spontaneously from self-organization harnessing far-from-equilibrium dynamics. This work explores interdisciplinary concepts from material physics, chemistry, biology, and computation, identifying concrete pathways toward developing materials that not only react, but actively perceive, adapt, learn, self-correct, and potentially self-construct, moving beyond biomimicry to cultivate fully synthetic, self-evolving systems without external control. This framework outlines the fundamental requirements for, and constraints upon, future architectures where complex, goal-directed functionalities emerge synergistically from integrated local processes, distinguishing material-based intelligence from traditional hardware-software divisions. This demands that concepts of high-level goals and robust, replicable memory mechanisms are encoded and enacted through the material's inherent dynamics, inherently blurring the distinction between system output and process.</p></details> |  |

Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (including supplemental), 9 figures</p></details> |

This work focuses on performance enhancements through targeted low-level and NUMA-aware tuning on a single-node system, thereby not only advancing the efficiency of classical quantum simulations but also establishing a foundation for scalable, heterogeneous implementations that bridge toward noiseless quantum computing. Although few prior studies have reported similar hardware-level optimizations, such implementations have not been released as open-source software, limiting independent validation and further development. We introduce an open-source, high-performance extension to the QuEST state vector simulator that integrates state-of-the-art low-level and NUMA-aware optimizations for modern processors. Our approach emphasizes locality-aware computation and incorporates hardware-specific techniques including NUMA-aware memory allocation, thread pinning, AVX-512 vectorization, aggressive loop unrolling, and explicit memory prefetching. Experiments demonstrate substantial speedups--5.5-6.5x for single-qubit gate operations, 4.5x for two-qubit gates, 4x for Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), and 1.8x for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Algorithmic workloads further achieve 4.3-4.6x acceleration for Grover and 2.5x for Shor-like circuits. These results show that systematic, architecture-aware tuning can significantly extend the practical simulation capacity of classical quantum simulators on current hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, 9 pseudocodes</p></details> |
| **[Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04118v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</p></details> |  |

To achieve that, it is important to understand how quantum and classical computing can interact together, and how one can characterize the scalability and efficiency of hybrid quantum-classical workflows. So far, early experiments with quantum-centric supercomputing workflows have been limited in scale and complexity. Here, we use a Heron quantum processor deployed on premises with the entire supercomputer Fugaku to perform the largest computation of electronic structure involving quantum and classical high-performance computing. We design a closed-loop workflow between the quantum processors and 152,064 classical nodes of Fugaku, to approximate the electronic structure of chemistry models beyond the reach of exact diagonalization, with accuracy comparable to some all-classical approximation methods. Our work pushes the limits of the integration of quantum and classical high-performance computing, showcasing computational resource orchestration at the largest scale possible for current classical supercomputers.</p></details> |  |
| **[iDART: Interferometric Dual-AC Resonance Tracking nano-electromechanical mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19063v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a >10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.</p></details> |  |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Suppl.: 16 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Self-Enhancing Halite Growth Creates Secondary Porous Networks During CO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17241v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salt precipitation during CO2 injection into saline aquifers obstructs flow-controlling pore throats and reduces permeability, yet reactive transport models assume salt forms dispersed, non-porous crystals with minimal flow impact. We demonstrate that halite instead creates three-dimensional porous networks with 40% internal porosity through self-enhancing growth mechanisms absent from current models. Time-lapse X-ray micro-computed tomography and spectral imaging reveal preferential nucleation at gas-liquid interfaces, where porous hydrophilic aggregates generate capillary suction that draws brine films toward precipitation sites, accelerating growth and expanding reactive surface area in a positive feedback loop. Spectral tomography shows systematic density gradients reflecting two-stage precipitation: dense macrocrystalline cores formed under moderate supersaturation and evaporation, surrounded by microcrystalline overgrowths from rapid late-stage dynamics. These overgrowths create umbrella-like crusts that encapsulate residual brine beneath surface layers. This porous architecture explains why modest porosity reduction causes severe permeability decline, as aggregates preferentially obstruct flow percolation pathways rather than uniformly cementing grains or filling pore space. Five interconnected mechanisms drive self-enhancing growth across nano- to centimeter scales: interface nucleation, secondary porous structure formation, steep concentration gradients, hydrophilic substrate film maintenance, and capillary-driven solute delivery. Our quantitative characterization of internal salt architecture, reactive surface areas, and pore connectivity provides essential parameters for improving predictive models of evaporation-precipitation dynamics in carbon storage, soil salinization, and cultural heritage preservation.</p></details> |  |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of competing bond-order and loop-current fluctuations as a possible mechanism for superconductivity in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00134v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pairing symmetry and underlying mechanism for superconducting state of AV${}_3$Sb${}_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) kagome metal has been a topic of intense investigation. In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $θ$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $π$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120°, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+3 p...</summary><p>9+3 pages, 10 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect.

Weak-coupling analyses and mean field calculations have demonstrated that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_2$ drives, respectively, real and imaginary bond-ordered CDW, with the latter corresponding to time-reversal symmetry breaking loop current CDW. It is important to understand the inter-layer correlation of these bond-ordered CDWs and its consequences in the bulk kagomé materials. To provide physical insights, we investigate in this paper the $c$-axis stacking of them, loop current CDW in particular, on the minimal bilayer kagomé lattice. The bare susceptibilities for stacking of real and imaginary bond orders are calculated for the free electrons on the bilayer kagomé lattice with inter-layer coupling $t_\perp=0.2t$, which splits the van Hove filling to $n_{+\text{vH}}=4.64/12$ and $n_{-\text{vH}}=5.44/12$. While real and imaginary bond-ordered CDWs are still favored, respectively, by $V_1$ and $V_2$, their inter-layer coupling is sensitive to band filling $n$. They tend to stack symmetrically near $n_{\pm\text{vH}}$ with identical bond orders in the two layers and give rise to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 1c_0$ CDW. On the other hand, they prefer to stack antisymmetrically around $n_\text{vH}$ with opposite bond orders in the two layers and lead to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 2c_0$ CDW. The concrete bilayer $t$-$t_\perp$-$V_1$-V$_2$ model is then studied. We obtain the mean-field ground states and determine the inter-layer coupling as a function of band filling at various interactions. The nontrivial topological properties of loop current CDWs are studied ...</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This work stresses that for translationally invariant lattice Hamiltonians with periodic boundary conditions, one can easily derive efficiently computable lower bounds to ground state energies that can and should be compared with variational principles providing upper bounds. As small technical results, it is shown that (i) the Anderson bound and a (ii) common hierarchy of semi-definite relaxations both provide approximations with performance guarantees that scale like a constant in the energy density for cubic lattices.

On the lattice, the manifeslty gauge invariant subspace is known to be exactly spanned by gauged tensor networks.

Their 3-tensors satisfying the ``zipper condition'' play an important role there. We identify their 4-tensors with bi-unitary connections in Jones' subfactor theory in operator algebras with precise normalization constants. Then we prove that their tensors satisfying the zipper condition are the same as flat fields of strings in subfactor theory which correspond to elements in the higher relative commutants of the subfactor arising from the bi-unitary connection. This is what we expect, since the zipper condition is a kind of pentagon relations, but we clarify what conditions are exactly needed for this -- we do not need the flatness or the finite depth condition for the bi-unitary connection. We actually generalize their 4-tensors so that the four index sets of the 4-tensors can be all different and work on a ``half-version'' of the zipper condition.</p></details> |  |

Core Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09943v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks. The SeQuant source code is available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/SeQuant.</p></details> |  |

This approach is hindered by two major challenges: the high computational cost of evaluating energies and gradients, and an ill-conditioned optimization landscape that slows convergence. To reduce the number of optimization steps, we introduce an efficient preconditioner derived from the leading term of the metric tensor. We benchmark our method against standard optimization techniques on the Heisenberg and Kitaev models, demonstrating substantial improvements in overall computational efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across various contraction schemes, unit cell sizes, and Hamiltonians, highlighting the potential of preconditioned optimization to advance tensor network algorithms for strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 8 pages,4 figures |
| **[Tensor Network Framework for Forecasting Nonlinear and Chaotic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09233v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a tensor network model (TNM) for forecasting nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, bridging quantum many-body methods with classical complex systems. The TNM leverages hierarchical tensor contractions to encode non-Markovian temporal correlations and multiscale structures, enabling compact and interpretable representations of chaotic flows. Using the Lorenz and Rössler systems as benchmarks, we show that the TNM accurately reconstructs short-term trajectories and faithfully captures the attractor geometry. The model enables robust short-term forecasting beyond several Lyapunov times, offering a meaningful horizon for data-driven prediction under chaos. Inhomogeneous parametrization of weight tensors improves convergence and robustness compared to homogeneous parametrization, while scaling with bond dimension reveals saturation beyond modest values, consistent with the low intrinsic dimensionality of the chaotic attractor. This work establishes tensor networks as a universal paradigm for data-driven modeling of complex dynamical systems, offering physically motivated control of model expressivity and opening pathways toward applications in climate systems and hybrid quantum-classical simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group-Theoretic Structure Governing Identifiability in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08995v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In physical systems possessing symmetry, reconstructing the underlying causal structure from observational data constitutes an inverse problem of fundamental importance. In this work, we formulate the inverse problem of causal inference within the framework of group-representation theory, clarifying the structure of the representation spaces to which the {\it causality} and estimation maps belong. This formulation leads to both theoretical and practical limits of reconstructability (identifiability). We show that the local velocity-gradient tensor, regarded as a {\it causal factor}, can be reconstructed from the orientational motion of suspended particles. In this setting, the estimation map must act as a group homomorphism between the observation and causal spaces, and the reconstructable subspace is constrained by the decomposition structure of the SO(3) representation. Based on this principle, we construct an SO(3)-equivariant neural network (implemented with the e3nn framework) and verify that the identifiability determined by the group-representation structure is reproduced in the actual learning process. These results demonstrate a fundamental principle that the group-representation structure determines the reconstructability (identifiability limit) in inverse problems of causal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (4 main + 5 supplementary)</p></details> |

TNs are particularly suitable for one-dimensional local Hamiltonians, while their performance for generic geometries is mainly limited by two aspects: the limitation in expressive power and the approximate extraction of information. Here we investigate the performance of superposition-of-product-states (SPS) ansatz, a variational framework structurally related to canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. The ansatz does not compress information as effectively as tensor networks, but it has the advantages (i) of allowing accurate extraction of information, (ii) of being structurally independent of the geometry of the system, (iii) of being readily parallelizable, and (iv) of allowing analytical shortcuts. We first study the typical properties of the SPS ansatz for spin-$1/2$ systems, including its entanglement entropy, and its trainability. We then use this ansatz for ground state search in tilted Ising models -- including one-dimensional and three-dimensional with short- and long-range interaction, and a random network -- demonstrating that SPS can attain high accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore, strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.</p></details> |  |

Our results reveal distinct bond-ordered phases for spin-1, spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$, and spin-2 models. In all cases, we find translational symmetry breaking with unit cells being tripled by forming valence-bond orders. However, these three phases are distinct, forming plaquette order, topological dimer order, and non-topological dimer order, respectively. Our findings are based on a cross-validation between variational two-dimensional tensor network calculations: an unrestricted exploration of symmetry-broken states versus the detection of symmetry breaking from cat-state behavior in symmetry-restricted states. The origin of different orders can also be understood from a theoretical analysis. Our work sheds light upon the interplay between topological and symmetry-breaking orders as well as their detection via tensor networks.</p></details> | 4 + 3 pages |

Using symmetry analysis of the single-particle Green's function, we classify spectral functions by irreducible representations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Complementarily, we calculate the one-body reduced density matrix which allows us to reach both a qualitative description of charge distribution and an analysis of the state purity. Moreover, within the Tensor Network framework, we employ a Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to confirm the presence of three distinct phases and their corresponding phase transitions. Our results highlight how symmetry-labelled spectral functions and effective orbital analysis provide accessible single-particle tools for probing correlation-driven insulating phases.</p></details> |  |

The recently developed tangent-space tensor renormalization group (tanTRG) provides an efficient and accurate framework by representing thermal density operators as matrix product operators. However, the particle number generally varies during the cooling process. The conventional strategy of fine-tuning chemical potentials to reach a target filling is computationally demanding. Here we propose a fixed-$N$ tanTRG algorithm that stabilizes the average particle number by adaptively tuning the chemical potential within the imaginary-time evolution. We benchmark its accuracy on exactly solvable free fermions, and further apply it to the square-lattice Hubbard model. For hole-doped cases, we study the temperature evolution of charge and spin correlations, identifying several characteristic temperature scales for stripe formation. Our results establish fixed-$N$ tanTRG as an efficient and reliable tool for finite-temperature studies of correlated fermion systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, comments are welcome</p></details> |

The results are benchmarked against fundamental bounds obtained either via a latest quantum comb extension method or an optimized classical simulation method. We find that the spin-squeezed offer practically optimal performance in the regime where phase fluctuations are positively correlated, but can be outperformed by tensor-network optimized strategies for negatively correlated fluctuations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, accepted by Physical Review Research</p></details> |
| **[GCAMPS: A Scalable Classical Simulator for Qudit Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06672v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical simulations of quantum systems are notoriously difficult computational problems, with conventional state vector and tensor network methods restricted to quantum systems that feature only a small number of qudits. The recently introduced Clifford Augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) method offer scalability and efficiency by combining both tensor network and stabilizer simulation techniques and leveraging their complementary advantages. This hybrid simulation method has indeed demonstrated significant improvements in simulation performance for qubit circuits. Our work generalises the CAMPS method to higher quantum degrees of freedom -- qudit simulation, resulting in a generalised CAMPS (GCAMPS). Benchmarking this extended simulator on quantum systems with three degrees of freedom, i.e. qutrits, we show that similar to the case of qubits, qutrit systems also benefit from a comparable speedup using these techniques. Indeed, we see a greater improvement with qutrit simulation compared to qubit simulation on the same $T$-doped random Clifford benchmarking circuit as a result of the increased difficulty of conventional qutrit simulation using tensor networks. This extension allows for the classical simulation of problems that were previously intractable without access to a quantum device and will open new avenues to study complex many-body physics and to develop efficient methods for quantum information processing.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Simulating Clifford Circuits with Gaussian Elimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06127v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum circuits are considered more powerful than classical circuits and require exponential resources to simulate classically. Clifford circuits are a special class of quantum circuits that can be simulated in polynomial time but still show important quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we present an algorithm that simulates Clifford circuits by performing Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit structure. Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm is also efficient when computing many amplitudes or samples of a Clifford circuit. Further, our amplitudes formula provides a new characterization of locally Clifford equivalent graph states as well as an efficient protocol to learn graph states with low-rank adjacency matrices.</p></details> |  |

This task requires extensive simulations of faulty quantum circuits, which are often made tractable by considering stochastic Pauli noise models, as they are compatible with efficient classical simulation techniques. However, such noise models do not fully capture the variety of physical error mechanisms encountered in realistic quantum platforms. In this work, we extend circuit-level noise modeling beyond the Pauli framework by estimating the threshold of the color code under more general noise models. Specifically, we consider two representative non-Pauli error channels: a systematic $X$-rotation model that introduces coherent over-rotations, and an amplitude damping channel that captures relaxation processes. These models are incorporated at the circuit level into color code circuits using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz. Our simulations demonstrate that tensor network simulations enable accurate threshold estimation under non-Pauli noise for color codes up to distance $d=7$ (73 qubits). Comparing our results with the Pauli twirling approximations of the noise models, we find that coherent over-rotations yield systematically higher error rates, deviating from the Pauli twirling approximation as the code distance increases.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</p></details> | In submission |

The SWAP networks, composed exclusively of local two-qubit gates, effectively mediate non-local qubit interactions. We investigate two distinct network architectures based on rectangular and triangular meshes of SWAP gates and analyze their performance in combination with spectral qubit ordering, which maps logical qubits to MPS sites based on the Laplacian of the logical qubit connectivity graph. The proposed framework is evaluated on synthetic MaxCut instances with varying graph connectivity, as well as on a dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on real historical asset data involving 180 qubits. On certain problem configurations, we observe an over 20$\times$ reduction in error when combining spectral ordering and triangular SWAP networks compared to optimization with shuffled qubit ordering. Furthermore, an analysis of the entanglement entropy during portfolio optimization reveals that spectral qubit ordering not only improves solution quality but also enhances the total and spatially distributed entanglement within the MPS. These findings demonstrate that exploiting problem structure through spectral mapping and efficient routing networks can substantially enhance the performance of tensor-network-based optimization algorithms.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of variational quantum algorithms in solving the particle track reconstruction problem. We present an analysis of two distinct formulations for identifying straight-line tracks in a multilayer detection system, inspired by the LHCb vertex detector. The first approach is formulated as a ground-state energy problem, while the second approach is formulated as a system of linear equations. This work addresses one of the main challenges when dealing with variational quantum algorithms on general problems, namely designing an expressive and efficient quantum ansatz working on tracking events with fixed detector geometry. For this purpose, we employed a quantum architecture search method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to design the quantum circuits for different problem sizes.

Simulating directly in the thermodynamic limit, we explore the relaxation process near the critical point with two types of initial states: a fully polarized state and a product state with a small magnetization. For the fully polarized state, the magnetization shows a power law scaling $M\propto τ^{-β/(νz)}$ in the imaginary-time evolution, from which both the critical point and critical exponent can be determined with high accuracy. For the nearly paramagnetic state, the relaxation process exhibits a behavior of $M\propto τ^θ$ with $θ=0.1958$ being the critical initial-slip exponent, which is in good agreement with that obtained from the dynamic scaling of the self-correlation in quantum Monte Carlo method. These universal features emerge well before the system converges to the ground state, demonstrating the efficiency of imaginary-time evolution for probing quantum criticality. Our results demonstrate that iPEPS can serve as a robust and scalable method for studying dynamical critical phenomena in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Here, we study in detail the classical spin liquid properties of this lattice of tri-coordinated tetrahedra using classical Monte Carlo and large-$N$ theory calculations. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the system presents a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, giving rise to a fragile spin liquid with exponentially decaying correlations according to the classification of classical spin liquids. We confirm that this scenario also holds in the more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, for which the system does not exhibit any finite-temperature phase transition, and the low-temperature spin structure factors exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with the large-$N$ theory. We also provide insight into the quantum $S=1/2$ limit by performing pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations at finite temperatures, and discuss the possible phases that can arise in the ground state due to quantum fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the influence of the onsite Hubbard $U_{dd}$ and the charge transfer energy scale $ε_p$ on the electronic properties via the orbital occupancies, local moments, spin correlations, and spectral properties. Rich features of the orbital-resolved local and momentum-dependent spectra are revealed to associate with the possible Zhang-Rice singlet (ZRS) breakdown reflected by the peak splitting near the Fermi level in the heavily overdoped regime. Moreover, the pseudogap features at a small charge transfer energy scale (relevant to cuprates) are shown to diminish at larger $ε_p$, which implies the weakening or absence of the pseudogap in the infinite-layer nickelates. Besides, an optimal value of $ε_p$ is identified for maximizing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin correlations. Our large-scale simulations provide new insights on the well-established Emery model, particularly in the regime of heavily overdoped and/or large charge transfer energy scale.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in three-dimensional (3D) Rydberg arrays, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal weight superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single-mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[On the criticality of the configuration-space statistical geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00787v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While phases and phase transitions are conventionally described by local order parameters in real space, we present a unified framework characterizing the phase transition through the geometry of configuration space defined by the statistics of pairwise distances $r_H$ between configurations. Focusing on the concrete example of Ising spins, we establish crucial analytical links between this geometry and fundamental real-space observables, i.e., the magnetization and two-point spin correlation functions. This link unveils the universal scaling law in the configuration space: the standard deviation of the normalized distances exhibits universal criticality as $\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(r_H)}\sim L^{-2β/ν}$, provided that the system possesses zero magnetization and satisfies $4β/ν< d$. We validate this scaling with stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the transverse-field Ising model(TFIM). Furthermore, we propose configuration-space diagnostics that go beyond local real-space observables. First, the distribution probability $P(r_H)$ parameterized by the transverse field $h$ forms a one-dimensional manifold. Information-geometric analyses, particularly the Fisher information defined on this manifold, successfully pinpoint the TFIM phase transition, regardless of the measurement basis. Second, for the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Heisenberg model, a parity index derived from $P(r_H)$ successfully characterizes the symmetry-protected topological phase and its transition. Our work establishes configuration space geometry as a novel perspective on quantum criticality, revealing how macroscopic universal phenomena are encoded within its global statistical features.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08364v4)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: 4...</summary><p>v1: 4+8 pages, 3+3 figures; v2: paper restructured, minor typos corrected; v3: paper streamlined, discussion expanded; v4: matches published version</p></details> |

Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables.

Unfortunately, the applications of a QMC simulation are limited because extracting dynamic properties requires solving the analytic continuation (AC) problem. Across the many fields that use QMC methods, there is no universally accepted analytic continuation algorithm for extracting dynamic properties, but many publications compare to the maximum entropy method. We investigate when entropy maximization is an acceptable approach. We show that stochastic sampling algorithms reduce to entropy maximization when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We investigate when is Bryan's controversial optimization algorithm [Bryan, Eur. Biophys. J. 18, 165-174 (1990)] for entropy maximization (sometimes known as the maximum entropy method) appropriate to use. We show that Bryan's algorithm is appropriate when the noise is near zero or when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We also investigate the mean squared error, finding a better scaling when the Bayesian prior is near the true solution than when the noise is near zero. We point to examples of improved data-driven Bayesian priors that have already leveraged this advantage. We support these results by solving the double Gaussian problem using both Bryan's algorithm and the newly formulated dual approach to entropy maximization [Chuna et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 58, 335203 (2025)].</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 26 equations</p></details> |
| **[Dense packing of the surface code: code deformation procedures and hook-error-avoiding gate scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06758v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surface code is one of the leading quantum error correction codes for realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). One major challenge in realizing surface-code-based FTQC is the extremely large number of qubits required. To mitigate this problem, fusing multiple codewords of the surface code into a densely packed configuration has been proposed. It is known that by using dense packing, the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit can be reduced to approximately three-fourths compared to simply placing surface-code patches side by side. Despite its potential, concrete deformation procedures and quantitative error-rate analyses have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we present a detailed code-deformation procedure that transforms multiple standard surface code patches into a densely packed, connected configuration, along with a conceptual microarchitecture to utilize this dense packing. We also propose a CNOT gate-scheduling for stabilizer measurement circuits that suppresses hook errors in the densely packed surface code. We performed circuit-level Monte Carlo noise simulation of densely packed surface codes using this gate scheduling. The numerical results demonstrate that as the code distance of the densely packed surface code increases and the physical error rate decreases, the logical error rate of the densely packed surface code becomes lower than that of the standard surface code. Furthermore, we find that only when employing hook-error-avoiding syndrome extraction can the densely packed surface code achieve a lower logical error rate than the standard surface code, while simultaneously reducing the space overhead.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Quantum Monte Carlo study of magnetism and chiral d+id-wave superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06631v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We employ a large-scale, unbiased constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method to systematically simulate the effective two-orbital Hubbard model for twisted bilayer graphene in order to gain deeper insight into the relationship between correlated states and the superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted bilayer graphene, as well as the influence of the twist angle on superconductivity. Initially, we investigate the modulation of superconductivity by nearest-neighbor attractive Coulomb interactions, demonstrating that electron-phonon coupling plays a significant role in the system. Our numerical results reveal that the superconducting state is dominated by chiral NN-d+id superconducting electron pairing symmetry, and that such nearest-neighbor attractive Coulomb interactions significantly enhance the effective long-range pairing correlation function of chiral NN-d+id wave. Then, we explore how the twist angle affects the superconducting state. Our results show that as the twist angle deviates downward from 1.08°, the effective pairing correlation function of the chiral NN-d+id wave increases substantially. Through these investigations, our numerical findings not only contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of strongly correlated systems such as twisted bilayer graphene, but also provide guidance for identifying twist-angle systems with potentially higher superconducting transition temperatures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resonating valence bond pairing energy in graphene by quantum Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06506v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $π/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum computing quantum Monte Carlo algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10431v3)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) are respectively the state-of-the-art quantum and classical computing methods for understanding many-body quantum systems. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that integrates these two methods, inheriting their distinct features in efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states and overcoming their limitations. We first introduce non-stoquasticity indicators (NSIs) and their upper bounds, which measure the sign problem, the most notable limitation of QMC. We show that our algorithm could greatly mitigate the sign problem, which decreases NSIs with the assistance of quantum computing. Meanwhile, the use of quantum Monte Carlo also increases the expressivity of shallow quantum circuits, allowing more accurate computation that is conventionally achievable only with much deeper circuits. We numerically test and verify the method for the N$_2$ molecule (12 qubits) and the Hubbard model (16 qubits). Our work paves the way to solving practical problems with intermediate-scale and early-fault tolerant quantum computers, with potential applications in chemistry, condensed matter physics, materials, high energy physics, etc.</p></details> |  |

Here, we combine resonant inelastic x-ray and neutron total scattering techniques with advanced modelling to study the local lattice distortions, electronic structure, and electron-phonon coupling ($e$-ph) in BKBO as a function of doping. Data for the parent compound ($x = 0$) indicates that the electronic gap opens in predominantly oxygen-derived states strongly coupled to a long-range ordered breathing distortion of the oxygen sublattice. Upon doping, short-range breathing distortions and sizable ($e$-ph) coupling persist into the superconducting regime ($x = 0.4$). Comparisons with exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations further support this conclusion. Our results provide compelling evidence that BKBO's metallic phase hosts a liquid of small (bi)polarons derived from local breathing distortions of the lattice, with implications for understanding the low-temperature superconducting instability</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Emitter in a Cavity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08511v4)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the primary methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work presents a detailed theoretical investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an emitter in a doubly resonant cavity. The system is modeled by the Lindblad master Equation, and an approximate analytical solution is derived to determine the experimentally achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. Additionally, the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits are also identified. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency is approximately 35%, which is significantly higher than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Mandel Q parameter, revealing highly bunched two-photon emission and super-Poissonian statistics. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and its spectrum consists of three prominent peaks corresponding to transitions between the dressed states of the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tractable Infinite-Horizon Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Quantum Filtering via Eigenstate Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05916v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model predictive control has shown potential to enhance the robustness of quantum control systems. propose a tractable Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework for finite-dimensional quantum systems under continuous-time measurement and quantum filtering. Using the almost-sure eigenstate reduction of quantum trajectories, we prove that the infinite-horizon stochastic objective collapses to a fidelity term that is computable in closed form from the one-step averaged state. Consequently, the online SMPC step requires only deterministic propagation of the filter and a terminal fidelity evaluation. An advantage of this method is that it eliminates per-horizon Monte Carlo scenario sampling and significantly reduces computational load while retaining the essential stochastic dynamics. We establish equivalence and mean-square stability guarantees, and validate the approach on multi-level and Ising-type systems, demonstrating favorable scalability compared to sampling-based SMPC.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Adaptive Entanglement-Aware Routing for Satellite Quantum Networks under Orbital and Atmospheric Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05228v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expansion of satellite-based quantum networks requires adaptive routing mechanisms that can sustain entanglement under dynamic orbital and atmospheric conditions. Conventional schemes, often tailored to static or idealised topologies, fail to capture the combined effects of orbital motion, fading, and trust variability in inter-satellite links. This work proposes an \textit{adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework} that jointly accounts for orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link evaluation. The routing metric integrates fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights to maintain connectivity and mitigate loss from turbulence and fading. Monte Carlo simulations across multiple orbital densities ($ρ= 10^{-6}$~km$^{-3}$) and environmental regimes, standard atmosphere, strong turbulence, and clear-sky LEO show up to a 275\% improvement in key generation rate and a 15\% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing adaptive methods. The framework achieves sub-linear path-length scaling with network size and remains robust for fading variances up to $σ_{\mathrm{fade}}=0.1$, demonstrating strong potential for future global quantum constellations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05222v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schrödinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or large amounts of configurations, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as DFT. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires $3N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces, which is not negligible as the system size increases. This paper presents a way to replace the $3N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. This improves the computational cost and scalability of the method. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the corrected VMC forces with those obtained by the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are significantly biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values much closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |

We show that, in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers, rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault model of the compound.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

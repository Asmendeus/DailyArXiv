| **[Ex Situ Fabrication of Superconducting Nanostructures for Low-Temperature STM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14092v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nanofabrication enables flexible experimental design but is often incompatible with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) due to the latter's stringent surface quality requirements. Here, we present a fabrication strategy that combines ex situ nanolithography with in situ ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) cleaving to produce atomically clean, nanopatterned superconductor/topological insulator (TI) heterostructures suitable for high-resolution STM/STS. In our initial Design I, nanoribbons were defined by etching trenches into a TI film, followed by niobium capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This enabled STM/STS to be applied in large areas, although edge quality was limited by etch debris. To overcome this, we developed Design II, which avoids etching through the film by locally thinning it, leaving nanoscale ribbons raised above a continuous TI layer, followed again by Nb capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This method yields clean, reproducible nanostructures with well-defined superconducting gaps, demonstrating a reliable fabrication pathway for high-resolution STM/STS studies of nanoscale topological devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, with 13 figures.

| **[Sizable superconducting gap and anisotropic chiral topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13843v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological superconductors offer a fertile ground for realizing Majorana zero modes -- topologically protected, zero-energy quasiparticles that are resilient to local perturbations and hold great promise for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent studies have presented encouraging evidence for intrinsic topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi$_2$, hinting at a robust surface phase potentially stable beyond the McMillan limit. However, due to substantial spatial variations in the observed superconducting (SC) gap $\Delta$ the nature of the underlying order parameter $\Delta$($k$) remained under debate. Here we report the realization of sizable surface SC gaps ($\Delta > 10\,\mathrm{meV}$) in PtBi$_2$, exhibiting remarkable spatial uniformity from hundreds of nanometers down to the atomic level, as revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Building on this spatial homogeneity -- indicative of long-range phase coherence -- we uncover previously unobserved low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) that ubiquitously emerge within the SC gap across the surface. Theoretical simulations that closely reproduce the experimental spectra, reveal an anisotropic chiral pairing symmetry of $\Delta$($k$), and further suggest that the observed ABSs are of topological origin. The combination of a large, nontrivial pairing gap and accessible surface states establishes PtBi$_2$ as a compelling platform for investigating topological superconductivity and its associated Majorana modes.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main manuscript consists of 14 pages and 4 figures, with 6 additional figures in the extended data section</p></details> |
| **[Strain-Engineered Electronic Structure and Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13694v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the films of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate superconductors, in which the (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system exhibits a remarkable transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K, were synthesized at ambient pressure. We systematically investigate the band structures and electronic correlation effect to identify the key factors controlling superconductivity and pathways to enhance $T_c$. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct a bilayer two-orbital ($3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$) tight-binding model for a series of in-plane compression mimicking the substrate effect. We find the band energy at the $M$ point drops with the compression, leading to increase of the density of states at the Fermi level, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk under pressure. We then apply functional renormalization group (FRG) method to study the electronic correlation effect on the superconductivity. We find the $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust in the films, the same as the bulk. But somewhat surprisingly, for the films, we find $T_c$ can be enhanced by reducing the in-plane lattice constant, increasing the out-of-plane lattice constant, or further electron-doping. These findings are consistent with the itinerant picture of the superconductivity induced by spin-fluctuations and provide theoretical support for further boosting $T_c$ in future experiments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Kondo overscreening in the presence of superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01924v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>15+11...</summary><p>15+11 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[High-performance amorphous superconducting rhenium films by e-beam evaporation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13536v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present electron beam evaporation of rhenium films on room-temperature substrates. The films are shown to be amorphous and achieve a record-high critical temperature for rhenium - exceeding 7 K at the midpoint of the transition - alongside a high critical current density of 5000 A/mm^2 and critical fields above 10 T. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals a BCS-like character of superconductivity with a zero-temperature energy gap of approximately 2 meV and subgap optical conductivity. Despite being friable, the films are stable and compatible with lift-off processes that opens the capabilities for superconducting device applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Enhanced Superconducting Qubit Networks for In-Sensor Quantum Information Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13228v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20842v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 + 7...</summary><p>6 + 7 pages, 4 + 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dissipating quartets of excitations in a superconducting circuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05960v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, autonomous stabilization of bosonic qubits has emerged as a promising approach for hardware-efficient protection of quantum information. However, applying these techniques to more complex encodings than the Schr\"odinger cat code requires exquisite control of high-order wave mixing processes. The challenge is to enable specific multiphotonic dissipation channels while avoiding unintended non-linear interactions. In this work, we leverage a genuine six-wave mixing process enabled by a near Kerr-free Josephson element to enforce dissipation of quartets of excitations in a high-impedance superconducting resonator. Owing to residual non-linearities stemming from stray inductances in our circuit, this dissipation channel is only effective when the resonator holds a specific number of photons. Applying it to the fourth excited state of the resonator, we show an order of magnitude enhancement of the state decay rate while only marginally impacting the relaxation and coherence of lower energy states. Given that stray inductances could be strongly reduced through simple modifications in circuit design and that our methods can be adapted to activate even higher-order dissipation channels, these results pave the way toward the dynamical stabilization of four-component Schr\"odinger cat qubits and even more complex bosonic qubits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Readout and Unconditional Reset for Superconducting Multi-Qubit Processors with Tunable Purcell Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06988v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high-fidelity qubit readout and reset while preserving qubit coherence is essential for quantum error correction and other advanced quantum algorithms. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a scalable architecture employing frequency-tunable nonlinear Purcell filters, enabling flexible readout and fast unconditional reset of multiple superconducting qubits. Our readout protocol dynamically adjusts the effective linewidth of the readout resonator through a tunable Purcell filter, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio during measurement while suppressing photon noise during idle periods. We achieve a readout fidelity of $99.3\%$ without any quantum-limited amplifier, even with a small dispersive shift. Moreover, by leveraging a reset channel formed via the adjacent coupling between the filter and the coupler, we realize unconditional qubit reset of both leakage-induced $|2\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ states within 200 ns and reset of the $|1\rangle$ state alone within 75 ns, with error rates $\leq 1\%$. The filter also mitigates both photon-induced dephasing and the Purcell effect, thereby preserving qubit coherence. This scalable Purcell filter architecture shows exceptional performance in qubit readout, reset, and protection, marking it as a promising hardware component for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of electronic correlations on the superconductivity of high-pressure CeH9](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12506v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare-earth superhydrides have attracted considerable attention because of their high critical superconducting temperature under extreme pressures. They are known to have localized valence electrons, implying strong electronic correlations. However, such many-body effects are rarely included in first-principles studies of rare-earth superhydrides because of the complexity of their high-pressure phases. In this work, we use a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory approach to study both electrons and phonons in the prototypical rare-earth superhydride CeH$_9$, shedding light on the impact of electronic correlations on its critical temperature for phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our findings indicate that electronic correlations result in a larger electronic density at the Fermi level, a bigger superconducting gap, and softer vibrational modes associated with hydrogen atoms. Together, the inclusion of these correlation signatures increases the Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting critical temperature from 47 K to 96 K, close to the measured 95 K. Our results reconcile experimental observations and theoretical predictions for CeH$_9$ and herald a path towards the quantitative modeling of phonon-mediated superconductivity for interacting electron systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Reviving the Search for Indium-Based Superconductors: Theoretical Prediction of Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11123v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis yields a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, increasing to 18 K under 15 GPa. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in RbH$_{12}$ at low pressures: an \emph{ab initio} study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12183v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-pressure polyhydrides are leading contenders for room temperature superconductivity. The next frontier lies in stabilizing them at ambient pressure, which would allow their practical applications. In this first-principles computational study, we investigate the potential for record-low pressure stabilization of binary superhydrides within the RbH$_{12}$ system including lattice quantum anharmonic effects in the calculations. %Within the pressure range of 0 to 100 GPa, we identify five competing phases. We identify five competing phases for the pressure range between 0 and 100 GPa. Incorporating anharmonic and quantum effects on ion dynamics, we find the $Immm$ and $P6_3/mmc$ phases to be the most probable, potentially metastable even at pressures as low as 10 GPa. Notably, all phases exhibit metallic properties, with critical temperatures between 50 and 100 K within the pressure range they are dynamically stable. These findings have the potential to inspire future experimental exploration of high-temperature superconductivity at low pressures in Rb-H binary compounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local control of parity and charge in nanoscale superconducting lead islands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12150v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small superconducting islands can exhibit charge quantization, where Coulomb interactions compete with Cooper pairing. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we probe this interplay by measuring the charging energy ($E_C$) and the pairing energy ($\Delta$) of individual nano-islands. Below a critical island size, where $E_C > \Delta$, we observe a crossover between even and odd parity ground states. By applying controlled voltage pulses, we continuously tune the island's electrostatic potential and map the full charge-parity landscape. These results demonstrate tunable superconducting ground states, offering a potential platform for qubit design and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Material Loss Model Calibration for Tantalum Superconducting Resonators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12141v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Material research is a key frontier in advancing superconducting qubit and circuit performance. In this work, we develop a simple and broadly applicable framework for accurately characterizing two-level system (TLS) loss using internal quality factor measurements of superconducting transmission line resonators over a range of temperatures and readout powers. We applied this method to a series of $\alpha$-Ta resonators that span a wide frequency range, thus providing a methodology for probing the loss mechanisms in the fabrication process of this emerging material for superconducting quantum circuits. We introduce an analytical model that captures the loss behavior without relying on numerical simulations, enabling straightforward interpretation and calibration. Additionally, our measurements reveal empirical frequency-dependent trends in key parameters of the model, suggesting contributions from mechanisms beyond the standard tunneling model of TLSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Diagnostic Criterion for Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04876v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) is distinguished from the Josephson diode effect (JDE) by its manifestation of nonreciprocal critical current phenomena within a monolithic superconductor, typically linked to finite-momentum Cooper pairing. The long-standing assumption that SDE requires co-breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries proves to be necessary but not sufficient. In this work, we propose a universal diagnostic criterion. Embodied in two concise inequalities, this criterion enables convenient and intuitive assessment of whether an intrinsic SDE can emerge in a given system without requiring extensive numerical calculations. Furthermore, our universal criterion provides explicit design guidelines for material systems exhibiting intrinsic SDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+8 p...</summary><p>7+8 pages, 2 figures, comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Spin-Valley Locking and Pure Spin-Triplet Superconductivity in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets Proximitized to Conventional Superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11921v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unconventional antiferromagnets with spin-split bands, such as noncollinear magnets and the recently discovered altermagnets, serve as new constituents to explore unconventional superconductivity. Here, we unveil a new type and previously unappreciated nature of spin-valley locking in noncollinear antiferromagnets and exploit this texture to achieve pure spin-triplet superconductivity. Using chiral antiferromagnetic kagome lattices (e.g., Mn$_3$Ge and Mn$_3$Ga) coupled to conventional $s$-wave superconductors as prototypical examples, we demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic chirality strongly favors spin-triplet pairing via superconducting proximity effect, while suppressing spin-singlet pairing in the antiferromagnets away from the interfaces. Crucially, such a long-sought spin-triplet superconducting state is established without invoking the prevailing mechanism of spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Furthermore, the spin-triplet supercurrent is resilient to both in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman fields, which exhibits distinct superiority to Ising superconductivity, serving as a compelling experimental signature of the triplet pairing and spin-valley-locked texture.</p></details> | 8 papges, 4 figures |
| **[Suppression of charge-density wave and superconductivity in a lithiated NbSe$_2$ monolayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11856v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an \textit{ab initio} investigation of the long-range charge density wave (CDW) order and superconducting properties of the pristine and lithiated NbSe$_2$ monolayer. Stable CDW structures are obtained through atomic reconstruction driven by soft-mode distortions and lithiation, respectively, lead to significant electronic modifications that suppress the CDW order. This suppression is attributed to anisotropic atomic distortions, along with a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. As a result, the electron--phonon coupling strength is suppressed, particularly in the lithiated structure, due to reduced contributions from low-frequency phonons, primarily associated with in-plane Nb vibrations. Finally, we observe a sizable anisotropy in the superconducting gap on the Fermi surface, with a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 8~K in the distorted, and 4~K in the lithiated, CDW NbSe$_2$ monolayer.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages and 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</p></details> | <details><summary>13(+1...</summary><p>13(+19 pages appendix), 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Hund's Rule, Interorbital Hybridization, and High-$T_c$ Superconductivity in the Bilayer Nickelate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12769v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelate superconductors constitutes a fascinating quest. Here we investigate the intriguing interplay between Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization in a two-orbital model for bilayer nickelates, using a comprehensive tensor network approach: density matrix renormalization group for finite-size systems, infinite projected entangled-pair states in the thermodynamic limit, and thermal tensor networks for finite-temperature properties. We explain the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity observed in experiment, by identifying three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\mathrm{SC}}$. However, the former exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$, below which the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\mathrm{SC}}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\mathrm{SC}}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances with pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Ambient condition superconductivity via engineered polaronic environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03288v4)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A vanishing dielectric function is required for longitudinal plasmonic or polaronic modes in a polarizable uniform medium and, in general, heralds the presence of singular charge fluctuations. It is also known that a vanishing dielectric function of an environment strengthens Cooper pairing in a superconductor via resonant anti-shielding (RAS), regardless of pairing origin. We combine these notions in a strategy to strongly enhance superconductivity. Specifically, we propose a superlattice of an ultrathin superconductor film in direct contact with a monolayer of a metal-organic framework material. This structure possesses a momentum-independent and resonant effective dielectric function, a key feature for RAS-enhanced superconductivity. We show that the superlattice facilitates near perfect volumetric intermixing between the superconductor and the engineered dielectric environment. To estimate the critical temperature $T_c$ enhancement, we use the unrestricted Leuven's scaling method, which relates the spectral integral of the RAS-renormalized Eliashberg function $\alpha^2$F to $T_c$, which we showed previously to be in excellent agreement with ab initio simulations, and which we posit may underlie recent observations of enhanced $T_c$ in FeSe on SrTiO$_3$. We carried out a renormalization of the bare $\alpha^2$F, dividing it directly by |$\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)|^2$, where $\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)$ is the q-independent dielectric function of the dielectric environment. Our estimates show that ambient temperature and pressure operation could be achievable in the RAS scheme. We also calculated the quantum Fisher information from the dynamic charge susceptibility in the normal state (for vanishing losses) in our proposed superlattice, and our estimate suggests the presence of superconductivity signatures well above $T_c$ due to quantum charge entanglement buildup.</p></details> |  |

| **[Ground and excited-state properties of the extended Hubbard dimer from the multichannel Dyson equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12437v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have recently presented the multichannel Dyson equation as an alternative to the standard single-channel Dyson equation. While the latter involves a single many-body Green's function, the former uses a multichannel Green's function in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. Quasiparticles and satellites are thus naturally treated on equal footing in the multichannel Dyson equation. To assess the accuracy of our approach we apply it here to the ground- and excited-state properties of the extended Hubbard dimer, an exactly solvable model for $H_2$. In particular, we focus on the potential energy surface as well as the corresponding spectral functions and HOMO-LUMO gaps, which are well-known challenges for many-body approximations such as second Born and $GW$. We show that the multichannel Dyson equation gives overall very good results for all properties considered and outperforms both $GW$ and second Born. In particular, the multichannel Dyson equation yields the correct ground-state energy and HOMO-LUMO gap in the dissociation limit contrary to $GW$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of artificial magnetic fields: Ground state and thermal phase diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11914v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider effects of artificial magnetic fields on the ground state of the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Using an asymmetric Bose-Hubbard model, we demonstrate that the frustrating hopping energy localizes bosons and enlarges insulators and supersolid borders. We show these increments in the presence of artificial gauge fields up to a symmetric point of the field. Moreover, our calculations exhibit the real space modulations of the superfluid and supersolid phases. The bosonic current exhibits vortices in these phases, which their configurations depend on the commensuration between the magnetic field and the lattice. Although the magnetic field breaks the translational symmetry of the square lattice explicitly, this symmetry is restored in the Mott insulator phase. The filling factor exhibits a checkerboard pattern in the density-wave and supersolid phases, regardless of the magnetic field strength. We explore thermal fluctuations and demonstrate the robustness of insulators and SS phases up to temperatures comparable to the interaction energy, which support the feasibility of observing such phases in experiments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

In the large on-site attraction limit, we identify three different phases: phase separation (PS), Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and charge density wave (CDW). Our analysis reveals that the $\eta$-clustering state, a three-component generalization of the $\eta$-pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO). Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we numerically study the phase diagram of the model with large but finite on-site interactions and find that the numerical results align with those obtained in the strong coupling limit.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[The electronic and transport properties in the Haldane-Hubbard with odd-parity altermagnetism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09906v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\bar{C}_2||\bar{E}]$ that allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\bar{C}_2$ represents a $180^\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with the spin-space inversion, and $\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM, and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization $M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits a non-monotonous behavior.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Nonequilibrium magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09593v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in strongly interacting many-body systems is understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we study the many-body magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model by developing a two-component extension of nonequilibrium bosonic dynamical mean-field theory. Using this numerical method, we uncover rich quantum spin dynamics via inter-species interaction quenches. A sudden ramp-up of interactions induces slow thermalization, leading to a long-lived metastable state, whereas quenching to weak interactions results in rapid thermal equilibrium, featuring a two-step relaxation behavior through distinct exponential decays. Furthermore, under periodic modulation of the inter-species interactions, emergent Floquet dynamics drives a transition from a magnetic to an unordered phase.</p></details> |  |

We have also developed a rather simple generalized mean-field approximation (GMFA) containing the amplitude of the spin correlations as a free parameter to fit the CPT data.The evolution of the Fermi surface and the pseudogap with the parameters $\phi$ and $U$ is explained from the viewpoint of the short-range magnetic order. The geometric frustration and the additional model parameter related to the spin-orbital interaction result in a more rich physics of the pseudogap state compared to the case of a more conventional square lattice.</p></details> |  |

Using the mean-field method, we identify various electronic and magnetic phases in the U-V plane, by calculating the site charge and spin densities. The electronic phases include partially charge-ordered metal or insulator, and fully charge-ordered insulator. The different magnetic phases of the model are non-magnet, spin density wave, spin split compensated ferrimagnet or partial antiferromagnet. Analysis of the electronic band structure reveals that the partially charge-ordered compensated ferrimagnetic phase exhibits spin polarisation, which can be quite interesting for spintronics applications. We also compute the polarisation as a function of $U$ using the Berry phase formalism and show that the system exhibits multiferroicity with coexisting compensated ferrimagnetic spin order alongside electronic polarisations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model, from an unbiased numerical perspective.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures and appendix</p></details> |

However, even the N=3 case remains poorly understood. We report a substantially new ground-state phase diagram of the square lattice SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model. Using a backflow ansatz, we identify strong signatures of a Mott transition and a subsequent magnetic transition, and the suppression of a previously predicted magnetic phase. We study the hole-doped model, identifying a transition from magnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the strong-coupling regime. Our findings offer a qualitatively new ground state picture. More broadly, our work suggests a path to study general SU(N) Hubbard models with arbitrary filling and geometry.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combine effect of site dilution and long-range interaction on magnetic and transport properties in the half-filled Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24036v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a diluted half-filled one-band Hubbard model with second-nearest-neighbor hopping on a simple cubic lattice, aiming to explore the possibility of metallicity in diluted antiferromagnetic systems. Our semiclassical Monte Carlo calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsive Hubbard interaction strength is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.</p></details> | 16 Pages, 11 Figs |

Here we access this paradigm, by confining dipolar excitons in a nanoscopic lattice where long-range tunneling, and nearest-neighbour dipolar repulsions, dress the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Long-range tunneling is evidenced by the spontaneous buildup of many-body sub-radiance, signalled by an algebraic slowdown of excitons radiative dissipation. In addition, we observe a threshold increase of temporal coherence for dipolar quantum solids only. It suggests that excitons condense in a single sub-radiant state for Mott-like phases. These combine then spatial order and extended phase coherence, in a single degree of freedom. Our sudy unveils that nanoscopic exciton arrays provide a unique platform to design new frontiers of strongly-correlated lattice models with long-range correlations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

To account for more general antiferromagnetic orders that go beyond the collinear N\'eel order, two different spin-orbit interactions, Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, are considered. By performing the canonical transformation, we derive the corresponding generalized t-J model. At half filling, employing self-consistent magnetic order calculations, we find distinctive spin arrangements under Dresselhaus or Rashba spin-orbit interactions. For the Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, the spin configuration exhibits collinear antiferromagnetic order. On the other hand, Rashba interaction results in spins antiferromagnetically aligning in xy-plane and a small interaction controlled by hopping parameter induces spin tilting, causing antiferromagnetic alignment in xy-plane but ferromagnetic alignment in z-direction. We categorize topological properties of these phases for low doping in the generalized t-J model.: for 3D collinear antiferromagnetic order, the system possesses a modified time-reversal symmetry, characterized by the Z2 index. In contrast, for systems with tilted antiferromagnetic orders, it is protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by the Z4 index. We further examine the bulk-edge correspondence for non-collinear magnetic phases, revealing that the surface state becomes gapless when the surface is parallel to the ferromagnetic component of tilted antiferromagnetic order; otherwise, the surface state exhibits a gap. Our findings offer a comprehensive topological characterization for doped and canted antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit interactions, providing valuable insights into the interplay between spin arrangements, symmetries, and topological properties in systems governed by the multi-orbital Hubbard model.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 17 figures, submitted to Phys.

| **[Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09708v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Symmetry-enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for a class of Bose-Hubbard type Hamiltonians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04672v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several recent works have derived Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) for Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. For certain structured initial states, e.g., vacuum perturbations or near-stationary states, information propagates with velocity $v \leq C$ . However, for general bounded-density initial states, it was shown by the first author, Vu, and Saito that the velocity can grow in time as $v \sim t^{D-1}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension -- demonstrating the possibility of accelerated information spreading in bosonic systems. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on this phenomenon: we show that translation invariance combined with local $p$-body repulsion ($n^p$ with $p > D+1$) qualitatively alters the propagation behavior, leading to a bound of the form $v \sim t^{\frac{D}{p - D - 1}}$ for general bounded-energy-density initial states. In particular, this establishes for an almost-linear light cone at large $p$, in stark contrast to the previously found accelerated regimes. Our result identifies symmetry-driven constraints as a new mechanism for suppressing propagation speed in bosonic systems and thereby reframes the scope of what types of LRBs can hold. We further provide matching examples showing that, under the given assumptions, this bound is sharp -- no further improvement in the power of $t$ is possible without invoking additional dynamical constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 2 figures; v2: minor corrections and improved presentation, including title change</p></details> |

To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagom\'e geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moir\'e TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09910v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01856v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specific heat and density anomalies in the Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04041v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological applications and to discover new phenomena. In particular, advances of experimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Fermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms experiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign. Moreover, our specific heat results demonstrate interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength.

Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |

Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</p></details> |  |

For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</p></details> | 5 + 6 pages |

For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

We systematically investigate the band structures and electronic correlation effect to identify the key factors controlling superconductivity and pathways to enhance $T_c$. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct a bilayer two-orbital ($3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$) tight-binding model for a series of in-plane compression mimicking the substrate effect. We find the band energy at the $M$ point drops with the compression, leading to increase of the density of states at the Fermi level, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk under pressure. We then apply functional renormalization group (FRG) method to study the electronic correlation effect on the superconductivity. We find the $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust in the films, the same as the bulk. But somewhat surprisingly, for the films, we find $T_c$ can be enhanced by reducing the in-plane lattice constant, increasing the out-of-plane lattice constant, or further electron-doping. These findings are consistent with the itinerant picture of the superconductivity induced by spin-fluctuations and provide theoretical support for further boosting $T_c$ in future experiments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Charge distribution and magnetism in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: a hybrid functional study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08123v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An accurate understanding of the ground state electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a high-temperature superconductor under pressure, is key for unveiling the origin of its superconductivity. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p></details> |  |

Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally observed nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. In addition, by analysing the orbital-resolved pairing configurations and their projections onto Fermi surface, we find that the nodeless feature of $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Moreover, we identify a formation of the inplane inter-orbital $d$-wave pairing between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which can even enhance the dominated interlayer $s_\pm$-wave.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements of superconducting (La,Pr,Sm)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates by developing an ultra-high vacuum low-temperature quenching and transfer technique. A finite superconducting gap of ~18 meV with pronounced coherence peak is observed along the Brillouin zone diagonal direction. Remarkably, the finite superconducting gap persists across the entire Brillouin zone of the underlying Fermi surfaces, revealing the absence of gap nodes. An abrupt band renormalization, manifested as a kink in the energy-momentum dispersion at ~70 meV below the Fermi level, indicates an electron-boson coupling in the system. The simultaneous observation of a nodeless superconducting gap and electron-boson coupling provides crucial insights into the pairing symmetry and gluing mechanism in high-T$_c$ RP bilayer nickelates.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule.

One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</p></details> |  |

We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In the hydrostatic pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in effective on-site repulsion in the maximally localized Wannier functions comprising the Ni 3$d$ $e_g$ bands crossing the Fermi energy, as determined by density functional theory. We attribute this increase to reduced screening by the spacer La 5$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ bands -- an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electron correlations. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we leverage intrinsic chemical pressure by applying the methodology to Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> |  |

Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to a unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetically ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest a simultaneous formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ , thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) (HTSC) in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with critical temperature $T_c$ higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has aroused a surge in the exploration of HTSC in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase multilayer nickelates. Very recently, SC is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ substrate with $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40\text{ K}$) at ambient pressure (AP), allowing various experimental investigation on the pairing mechanism in this material. It is now eager to enhance the $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Here we propose that an imposed strong perpendicular electric field can strongly enhance the $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. The physics underlying this proposal is clear and simple. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this layer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly enhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study and comprehensive two-orbital one under the mean-field treatment and the density matrix renormalization group approach consistently verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers is enough to realize HTSC with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15906v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

Within the bilayer Hubbard model and extended $t-J$ model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ doublet, we find the local strong correlation triggers $s_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing, with sign change of the gap function among the various Fermi pockets, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing is generically disfavored. This is in agreement with the results from functional renormalization group applied in the weak up to moderate correlation limit. We find the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital plays a leading role in the superconducting pairing. We also demonstrate the finite intra-orbital double occupancy even in the strong correlation limit, shedding light on the itinerant versus local moment picture of the electrons in this material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Our work focuses on two distinct pairing scenarios: intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. For systems with intralayer $d$-wave pairing, we establish an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the emergence of mid-gap resonant states. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the appearance of in-gap states is directly linked to the sign reversal of the order parameter along the Fermi surface. In interlayer pairing systems, our results reveal the presence of pronounced resonant peaks, which can also be attributed to the sign-changing nature of the order parameter. We further extend our analysis to the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a theoretical investigative of impurity effects in this material. Our findings not only elucidate the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity-induced states in unconventional superconductors but also offer a powerful tool for probing the pairing mechanisms in nickelate-based high-temperature superconductors. This work lays the groundwork for future experimental and theoretical investigations into the unique electronic properties of these emerging materials.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures and appendix</p></details> |

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18564v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $\Delta \lambda(T) \sim T^\alpha$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $\alpha < 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{\alpha_R}$ with $\alpha_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.</p></details> | 29 pages, 23 figures |

This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state. Taking into account the large decrease in $K_a$ in the SC state, we conclude that the $\boldsymbol{d}$ vector has components along all three crystal axes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 Figures + Supplemental Material with 18 pages, 16 Figures</p></details> |

We have investigated the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition in high-quality crystals of UTe$_2$ by tracking its signature in the magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$. A single, sharp superconducting transition is observed at low pressures 0.3 GPa. At higher pressure, a second feature emerges in $\chi(T)$, which is located at the lower-temperature thermodynamic phase boundary previously identified in specific heat measurements. This second transition anomaly in $\chi(T)$ can be attributed to a step change in the London penetration depth, providing direct evidence for a change in the superconducting order parameter of UTe$_2$. Thermodynamic constraints suggest that the low temperature, high pressure superconducting state is distinct from zero pressure superconductivity as well as from the high pressure, high temperature superconducting state, raising the possibility of multicomponent superconductivity in high pressure UTe$_2$.</p></details> |  |

We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by mirror symmetries provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 7 pages. 3 figures |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |

The surface flat bands originate from topological features supported by two key mechanisms: (1) a trivial Chern number prevents the zero-energy states from merging into the continuum of the bulk spectrum, thereby ensuring their confinement within the superconducting gap; and (2) weak spin conservation allows the gap function to exhibit phase winding. As a consequence, the surface exhibits a remarkably high density of states at nearly zero energy. Such surface states are likely to be realized in the candidate topological superconductor UTe$_2$. Our results provide important insights into the interpretation of recent Josephson STM experiments on UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 5 pages + 9 pages |
| **[Electronic dimensionality of UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15435v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in the heavy-fermion metal UTe2 survives the application of very high magnetic fields, presenting both an intriguing puzzle and an experimental challenge. The strong, non-perturbative influence of the magnetic field complicates the determination of superconducting order parameters in the high-field phases. Here, we report electronic transport anisotropy measurements in precisely aligned microbars in magnetic fields to 45 T applied along the b-axis. Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter. A pair-density-wave-like state at high fields could naturally induce a layered modulation of the superfluid density, forming planar structures that confine vortices and guide their sliding in the flux-flow regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surface charge density wave in UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12505v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</p></details> |  |

Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+17...</summary><p>11+17 pages, 4+14 figures. v2: Discussions added with minor changes in the acknowledgement</p></details> |

In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional charged Andreev bound states in a superconductor with a sublattice degree of freedom, where the sign of charge density of the Andreev bound states oscillates between the two sublattices. The oscillating-charged Andreev bound states lead to a complete breakdown of the proportionality among the electron part of the spectral function, the local density of states, and the tunneling conductance spectrum for energies below the superconducting gap. We also discuss the possible occurrence of these Andreev bound states in UTe$_2$ and locally noncentrosymmetric superconductors.</p></details> |  |

However, a comprehensive understanding of the topological phases in the superconducting states of UTe$_2$ is still lacking. Here, we present an exhaustive classification of topological phases for all time-reversal symmetry breaking pairing symmetries of UTe$_2$. Using the K theoretical classification approach, we uncover that 25 out of 36 possible pairing states are classified as higher-order topological phases, with some demonstrating hybrid-order topology through an intricate interplay of hinge and corner states. Furthermore, under the weak-coupling condition of the pair potentials, the possible pairing symmetries are constrained to $B_{ju} + i B_{ku}$, $A_{u} + i B_{j u}$, and $B_{j g} + iA_u$ ($j,k = 1,2,3$; $j \neq k$), where these symbols denote the irreducible representations of the point group $D_{2h}$. For these pairing states, the topological invariants are related to the Fermi surface topology via the Fermi-surface formula, enabling us to systematically diagnose higher-order topological phases. Using a tight-binding model, we demonstrate the higher-order topological phases of the mixed-parity $A_u + iB_{1g}$ superconductors, where the second-order and hybrid-order topological phases emerge as the number of Fermi surfaces enclosing the time-reversal invariant momentum evolves from two to four. The findings suggest that UTe$_2$ serves as a compelling platform for exploring higher-order topological superconductors with diverse topological surface states.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

Its surface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we propose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface and in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual features detected by surface probes in this material. Through a phenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental signatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of CDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii) the magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the CDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature and its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental checks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagom\'e lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagom\'e lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagom\'e metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagom\'e lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09316v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |

However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120{\deg}, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Connecting such bosonic $\pi$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $\pi$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04601v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</p></details> |  |

Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+3 p...</summary><p>9+3 pages, 10 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect. The present theory predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity, which is significant to understand the cascade of quantum electron states in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

However, to our best knowledge, unconventional magnetic states driven by van Hove singularities--like spin-density waves--have not been observed experimentally in kagome metals. Here, we report the magnetic and electronic structure of the layered kagome metal CeTi3Bi4, where Ti kagome electronic structure interacts with a magnetic sublattice of Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments. Neutron diffraction reveals an incommensurate spin-density wave ground state of the Ce3+ moments, coexisting with commensurate antiferromagnetic order across most of the temperature-field phase diagram. The commensurate component is preferentially suppressed by thermal fluctuations and magnetic field, yielding a rich phase diagram involving an intermediate single-Q spin-density wave phase. First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy identify van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, with the observed magnetic propagation vectors connecting their high density of states, strongly suggesting a van Hove singularity-assisted spin-density wave. These findings establish kagome metals LnTi3Bi4 as a model platform where the characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice plays a pivotal role in magnetic order.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, SI not included</p></details> |

Weak-coupling analyses and mean field calculations have demonstrated that nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_2$ drives, respectively, real and imaginary bond-ordered CDW, with the latter corresponding to time-reversal symmetry breaking loop current CDW. It is important to understand the inter-layer correlation of these bond-ordered CDWs and its consequences in the bulk kagom\'e materials. To provide physical insights, we investigate in this paper the $c$-axis stacking of them, loop current CDW in particular, on the minimal bilayer kagom\'e lattice. The bare susceptibilities for stacking of real and imaginary bond orders are calculated for the free electrons on the bilayer kagom\'e lattice with inter-layer coupling $t_\perp=0.2t$, which splits the van Hove filling to $n_{+\text{vH}}=4.64/12$ and $n_{-\text{vH}}=5.44/12$. While real and imaginary bond-ordered CDWs are still favored, respectively, by $V_1$ and $V_2$, their inter-layer coupling is sensitive to band filling $n$. They tend to stack symmetrically near $n_{\pm\text{vH}}$ with identical bond orders in the two layers and give rise to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 1c_0$ CDW. On the other hand, they prefer to stack antisymmetrically around $n_\text{vH}$ with opposite bond orders in the two layers and lead to a $2a_0 \times 2a_0 \times 2c_0$ CDW. The concrete bilayer $t$-$t_\perp$-$V_1$-V$_2$ model is then studied. We obtain the mean-field ground states and determine the inter-layer coupling as a function of band filling at various interactions.

The estimated magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 10$a$ ($a$ is the lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) above the surface could be in the order of 100mT; thus, they may be detectable by currently available detection methods. Next, we investigate the use of them as qubits (the ``SVILC qubits'') in an architecture composed of three nano-islands of the thin film; and consider the use of the detection of the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs as the qubit readout. We show there are a number of energy levels suitable for qubit states that can be manipulated by external current feeding, and the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs is large enough to be used for the readout.</p></details> |  |

Theoretical analyses propose a topologically nontrivial loop current phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry as the favorable CDW ground state. However, spectroscopic insights into the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds are still missing and conflicting experimental results question the presence of a loop current phase. We employed individual magnetic atoms as local quantum sensors to examine the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Our spectroscopic measurements show that the magnetic moment of Co induces a spatially-localized low-energy state in the CDW phase. The distinct spectral signatures of this state are consistent with theoretical expectations for the quasiparticle excitation of a loop current order parameter, while control experiment rule out alternative scenario. Our work provides unique insights into the ground state of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and introduces a novel method to examine other topological states, such as the fractional Chern insulators, with the STM.</p></details> |  |

A key feature of this CDW phase is a non-monotonic Hall effect at low fields, often attributed to TRS breaking. However, its origin remains unclear. Here, we conduct comprehensive magnetotransport measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and, through mobility spectrum analysis, identify the formation of tiny Fermi pockets with extremely high mobility below the CDW transition. Furthermore, electron irradiation experiments reveal that the non-monotonic Hall effect is significantly suppressed in samples with reduced mobility, despite no substantial change in the electronic structure. These results indicate that the non-monotonic Hall effect originates from these tiny Fermi pockets with high mobility carriers rather than anomalous Hall mechanisms, providing new insights into understanding the Hall anomaly in this kagome system.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, Supplemental Material</p></details> |
| **[Origin of switchable quasiparticle-interference chirality in loop-current phase of kagome metals measured by scanning-tunneling-microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07015v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The chiral loop-current (LC) phase in kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K) has attracted considerable attention as a novel quantum state driven by electron correlations. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments have provided strong evidence for the chiral LC phase through the detection of chirality in the quasiparticle interference (QPI) signal. However, the fundamental relationship between ``QPI chirality'' and ``LC chirality'' remains unexplored. For instance, the QPI signal is unchanged even when all LC orders are inverted. Furthermore, only the chiral LC order cannot induce QPI chirality. At present, the true essence of kagome metals that we should learn from the remarkable QPI experiments remains elusive. To address this, we investigate the origin of the QPI signal in the LC phase using a large unit-cell tight-binding model for kagome metals. The LC phase gives rise to a $Z_3$ nematic phase, characterized by three distinct directors, under the Star-of-David bond order. Our findings demonstrate that the QPI chirality induced by a single impurity at site Z, denoted as $\chi_Z$, can take values of $\pm1$ (chiral) or 0 (achiral), depending on the direction of the $Z_3$ nematic order. Prominent QPI chirality originates from extremely dilute impurities ($\lesssim$0.1%) in the present mechanism. Notably, $\chi_Z$ ($=\pm1$, 0) changes smoothly with minimal free-energy barriers by applying a small magnetic field $B_z$, accompanied by a switching of the $Z_3$ nematic director. This study provides a comprehensive explanation for the observed ``$B_z$-switchable QPI chirality'' in regions with dilute impurities, offering fundamental insight into the chiral LC in kagome metals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Symmetry-Broken Kondo Screening and Zero-Energy Mode in the Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20733v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum states of matter reorganize themselves in response to defects, giving rise to emergent local excitations that imprint unique characteristics of the host states. While magnetic impurities are known to generate Kondo screening in a Fermi liquid and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states in a conventional superconductor, it remains unclear whether they can evoke distinct phenomena in the kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (where A is K, Rb or Cs), which may host an orbital-antiferromagnetic charge density wave (CDW) state and an unconventional superconducting state driven by the convergence of topology, geometric frustration and electron correlations. In this work, we visualize the local density of states induced near various types of impurities in both the CDW and superconducting phases of CsV3-xMxSb5 (M = Ta, Cr) using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe Kondo resonance states near magnetic Cr dopants. Notably, unlike in any known metal or CDW compound, the spatial pattern of Kondo screening breaks all in-plane mirror symmetries of the kagome lattice, suggesting an electronic chirality due to putative orbital loop currents. While Cooper pairs show relative insensitivity to nonmagnetic impurities, native V vacancies with weak magnetic moments induce a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). This ZBCP coexists with trivial YSR states within the superconducting gap and does not split in energy with increasing tunneling transmission, tending instead to saturate. This behavior is reminiscent of signature of Majorana zero modes, which could be trapped by a sign-change boundary in the superconducting order parameter near a V vacancy, consistent with a surface topological superconducting state. Our findings provide a new approach to exploring novel quantum states on kagome lattices.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Anomalous spin-optical helical effect in Ti-based kagome metal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19589v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice stands as a rich platform for hosting a wide array of correlated quantum phenomena, ranging from charge density waves and superconductivity to electron nematicity and loop current states. Direct detection of loop currents in kagome systems has remained a formidable challenge due to their intricate spatial arrangements and the weak magnetic field signatures they produce. This has left their existence and underlying mechanisms a topic of intense debate. In this work, we uncover a hallmark reconcilable with loop currents: spin handedness-selective signals that surpass conventional dichroic, spin, and spin-dichroic responses. We observe this phenomenon in the kagome metal CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and we call it the anomalous spin-optical helical effect. This effect arises from the coupling of light' s helicity with spin-orbital electron correlations, providing a groundbreaking method to visualize loop currents in quantum materials. Our discovery not only enriches the debate surrounding loop currents but also paves the way for new strategies to exploit the electronic phases of quantum materials via light-matter interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12141v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal symmetry, have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying a small magnetic field as well as a tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% with the introduction of 1% impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The resulting giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originates from the nonlocal contribution of the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation of why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to dilute impurities.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

| **[Learning the non-Markovian features of subsystem dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14133v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Tensor network algorithm to solve polaron impurity problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05580v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The polaron problem is a very old problem in condensed matter physics that dates back to the thirties, but still remain largely unsolved today, especially when electron-electron interaction is taken into consideration. The presence of both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the problem invalidates most existing numerical methods, either computationally too expensive or simply intractable. The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii) measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC. We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future method developments.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Scalable tensor network algorithm for quantum impurity problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12722v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Higher Structures on Boundary Conformal Manifolds: Higher Berry Phase and Boundary Conformal Field Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12525v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the notion of higher Berry connection and curvature in the space of conformal boundary conditions in (1+1)d conformal field theories (CFT), related to each other by exactly marginal boundary deformations, forming a "boundary conformal manifold." Our definition builds upon previous works on tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS), where the triple inner product or multi-wavefunction overlap plays the key geometric role. On the one hand, our boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) formulation of higher Berry phase provides a new analytic tool to study families of invertible phases in condensed matter systems. On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.</p></details> | 63 pages |
| **[Critical spin models from holographic disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17235v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete models of holographic dualities, typically modeled by tensor networks on hyperbolic tilings, produce quantum states with a characteristic quasiperiodic disorder not present in continuum holography. In this work, we study the behavior of XXZ spin chains with such symmetries, showing that lessons learned from previous non-interacting (matchgate) tensor networks generalize to more generic Hamiltonians under holographic disorder: While the disorder breaks translation invariance, site-averaged correlations and entanglement of the disorder-free critical phase are preserved at a plateau of nonzero disorder even at large system sizes. In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a "dual" bulk hyperbolic tiling. Our results therefore suggest the existence of a whole class of critical phases whose symmetries are derived from models of discrete holography.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

This paper introduces a novel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with quantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle increasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN, TD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for optimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively increases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging parameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning efficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are augmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show that quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a 2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with ~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400). In the more complex 3-qubit setting, PERQDDQN and PERQTD3 reach success probabilities of ~0.47, with optimal success counts of ~3,800 and ~3,600, respectively, outperforming their classical counterparts. Additionally, we apply our QAS-QTN approach to a classification problem, where the optimized quantum circuit achieves an accuracy of 90.33\%, outperforming quantum models consisting of random ansatz. This hybrid classical-quantum approach leads to faster convergence and more efficient quantum circuit designs, demonstrating its potential for advancing automated quantum architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures.

In this work, we investigate how the choice of mapping from a two-dimensional lattice to a one-dimensional path affects the accuracy of the two-dimensional Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. We systematically evaluate all mappings corresponding to a subset of the Hamiltonian paths of the $N \cross N$ grid graphs up to $N=8$ and demonstrate that the fractal space-filling curves generally lead to faster convergence in ground state searches compared to the commonly used ``snake" path. To explain this performance gain, we analyze various locality metrics and propose a scalable method for constructing high-performing paths on larger lattices by tiling smaller optimal paths. Our results show that such paths consistently improve simulation convergence, with the advantage increasing with system size.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

This method provides an exact and explicit equation for these problems. Our algorithms are based on the simulation of a state that undergoes imaginary time evolution and a Half partial trace. In addition, we address the degenerate case and evaluate the polynomial complexity of the algorithm, also providing a parallelized version. We implemented and tested them with other well-known classical algorithms and observed an improvement in the quality of the results.

Here, we classically simulate various physically-motivated circuits using 2D tensor network ans\"atze for the many-body wavefunction which match the geometry of the underlying quantum processor. We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths. Our results underscore the role the geometry of the quantum processor plays in classical simulability.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Here we investigate the intriguing interplay between Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization in a two-orbital model for bilayer nickelates, using a comprehensive tensor network approach: density matrix renormalization group for finite-size systems, infinite projected entangled-pair states in the thermodynamic limit, and thermal tensor networks for finite-temperature properties. We explain the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity observed in experiment, by identifying three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\mathrm{SC}}$. However, the former exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$, below which the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\mathrm{SC}}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\mathrm{SC}}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances with pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 4+5 figures</p></details> |

This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.</p></details> | 14 pages, 15 figures |

Conventional DMRG and MPS methods frequently encounter limitations when dealing with subtle quantum correlations and entanglement structures near critical points, avoided crossings, and topologically ordered phases. By integrating the dynamical Uhlmann gauge potential and its categorical extensions into the numerical optimization and truncation procedures, our approach substantially improves coherence stability and accuracy. Through illustrative applications in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum dynamics, we demonstrate significant enhancements in precision and reliability, underscoring the broad potential of Uhlmann gauge-enhanced computational methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural super-orbitals representation of many-body operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10690v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators, defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated with a vectorized operator. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We propose a method to obtain unbiased estimators of multiple observables with low statistical error by post-processing informationally complete measurements using tensor networks. Compared to other observable estimation protocols based on classical shadows and measurement frames, our approach offers several advantages: (i) it can be optimised to provide lower statistical error, resulting in a reduced measurement budget to achieve a specified estimation precision; (ii) it scales to a large number of qubits due to the tensor network structure; (iii) it can be applied to any measurement protocol with measurement operators that have an efficient tensor-network representation. We benchmark the method through various numerical examples, including spin and chemical systems, and show that our method can provide statistical error that are orders of magnitude lower than the ones given by classical shadows.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures.

Quantum computing and quantum-inspired methods offer a promising avenue for efficiently simulating such phenomena. In this work, we investigate meson scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with staggered fermions. We develop a quantum subspace expansion technique to construct high-fidelity meson creation operators across a broad range of masses and momenta. Using Tensor Networks simulations, we study both elastic and inelastic scattering and provide a detailed analysis of energy transfer, entanglement entropy, and new particle production during the dynamics. In addition, we design an efficient quantum circuit for meson wave packet preparation using Givens rotations, significantly reducing the circuit depth compared to existing methods. Our work provides a non-variational and scalable framework for simulating meson scattering on near-term quantum devices, and provides a concrete strategy for quantum simulation to analyze non-perturbative dynamical processes in confining gauge theories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01699v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers are expected to enable fast solving of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, their limitations in fidelity and the number of qubits prevent them from handling real-world problems. Recently, a quantum-inspired solver using tensor networks has been proposed, which works on classical computers. Particularly, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. We showed mathematically that such feasible tensor networks can be constructed to accommodate various types of constraints. For the principle verification, we numerically constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem, to find much faster construction than conventional methods. Then, by performing imaginary time evolution, feasible solutions were always obtained, ultimately leading to the optimal solution.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |

Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figures.

We develop a unification framework that takes an arbitrary graphical model with loops and provides message passing update rules and inference equations. We show that recent state-of-the-art methods regarding tensors and BP, like block belief propagation and tensor network message passing, are special instances of our framework. From a practical perspective, we discuss how our framework can be useful in order to understand the benefits of scheduling in BP, and show how it can be used for decoding purposes in quantum error correction. Lastly, to numerically support our claims, we show that our framework can achieve an accuracy improvement of more than ten orders of magnitude over tensor network BP when computing the trace of a tensor network consisting of a chain of connected triangles with periodic boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312v5)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</p></details> | <details><summary>37+25...</summary><p>37+25 pages, 16 figures, 7 tables.

In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor network algorithm to solve polaron impurity problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05580v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The polaron problem is a very old problem in condensed matter physics that dates back to the thirties, but still remain largely unsolved today, especially when electron-electron interaction is taken into consideration. The presence of both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the problem invalidates most existing numerical methods, either computationally too expensive or simply intractable. The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii) measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC. We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future method developments.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Robustness of Magic in the quantum Ising chain via Quantum Monte Carlo tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12902v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Dynamics Simulation of Arbitrary Non-Hermitian Systems Based on Quantum Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11675v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit unique properties and hold significant promise for diverse applications, yet their dynamical simulation poses a particular challenge due to intrinsic openness and non-unitary evolution. Here, we introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm based on Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for simulating the dynamics of arbitrary time-dependent non-Hermitian systems. Notably, this approach constitutes a natural extension of the quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) algorithm. This algorithm combines the advantages of both classical and quantum computation and exhibits good applicability and adaptability, making it promising for simulating arbitrary non-Hermitian systems such as PT-symmetric systems, non-physical processes, and open quantum systems. To validate the algorithm, we applied it to the dynamic simulation of open quantum systems and achieved the desired results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable tensor network algorithm for quantum impurity problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12722v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Self-learning Monte Carlo Method: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12554v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Self-Learning Monte Carlo (SLMC) method is a Monte Carlo approach that has emerged in recent years by integrating concepts from machine learning with conventional Monte Carlo techniques. Designed to accelerate the numerical study of interacting many-body systems, SLMC significantly improves sampling efficiency by constructing an effective model -- via machine learning methods -- based on configurations generated by conventional Monte Carlo methods and then proposes global updates based on the effective model. This enhancement leads to a substantial reduction in autocorrelation time, especially near the critical region, where traditional methods typically suffer from critical slowing down and increased computation complexity. Moreover, SLMC maintains statistical accuracy by implementing a cumulative update scheme that rigorously satisfies the detailed balance condition. And more recent applications have extended the SLMC to convolutional neural networks with applications not only in condensed matter physics but also high-energy physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum simulations. The generic applicability and high computational efficiency make SLMC a powerful and scalable framework for quantum Monte Carlo simulations of strongly correlated electron systems, extending the reach of numerical investigations beyond the limitations of conventional techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages,10 figures, invited book chapter</p></details> |
| **[Internal dynamics and dielectric screening of confined multiexciton states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11087v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that biexcitons (BX) confined in large CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals experience reduced dielectric screening as compared to excitons (X) and trions (X$^*$). Here we provide a physical rationale to explain such a behavior. A characteristic frequency is introduced, which describes the internal dynamics of an exciton within the excitonic complex. By means of effective mass--variational Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that, in large nanocrystals, the frequency is similar for X and X$^*$, but smaller for BX. Because the frequencies exceed that of the bulk longitudinal optical phonon, this leads to a reduced dielectric constant for BX, which is in contrast with the behavior of strongly confined nanocrystals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum algorithm for solving McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10926v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Monte Carlo integration, a quantum algorithm for calculating expectations that provides a quadratic speed-up compared to its classical counterpart, is now attracting increasing interest in the context of its industrial and scientific applications. In this paper, we propose the first application of QMCI to solving McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs), a nonlinear class of SDEs whose drift and diffusion coefficients depend on the law $\mu_t$ of the solution $X_t$ -- appearing in fields such as finance and fluid mechanics. We focus on the problem setting where the coefficients depend on $\mu_t$ through expectations of some functions $\mathbb{E}[\varphi_k(X_t)]$, and the goal is to compute the expectation of a function $\mathbb{E}[\phi(X_T)]$ at a terminal time $T$. We devise a quantum algorithm that leverages QMCI to compute these expectations, combined with a high-order time discretization method for SDEs and extrapolation of the expectations in time. The proposed algorithm estimates $\mathbb{E}[\phi(X_T)]$ with accuracy $\epsilon$, making $O(1/\epsilon^{1+2/p})$ queries to the quantum circuit for time evolution over one step, where $p\in(1,2]$ is the weak order of the SDE discretization method. This demonstrates the speed-up over the well-known classical algorithm called the particle method with complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^3)$. We conduct a numerical demonstration of our quantum algorithm applied to an example of MVSDEs, with some parts emulated classically, and observe that the accuracy and complexity behave as expected.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory for the pseudogap and the transition to $d$-wave superconductivity in the cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05336v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits "Fermi arcs", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Neural Wavefunction Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10835v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for the design and analysis of optimization algorithms in variational quantum Monte Carlo, drawing on geometric insights into the corresponding function space. The framework translates infinite-dimensional optimization dynamics into tractable parameter-space algorithms through a Galerkin projection onto the tangent space of the variational ansatz. This perspective unifies existing methods such as stochastic reconfiguration and Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton, provides connections to classic function-space algorithms, and motivates the derivation of novel algorithms with geometrically principled hyperparameter choices. We validate our framework with numerical experiments demonstrating its practical relevance through the accurate estimation of ground-state energies for several prototypical models in condensed matter physics modeled with neural network wavefunctions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15428v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials could, in principle, be coupled with other materials to produce a more robust superconducting state. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed-configuration approximation for multi-orbital systems out of equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10717v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a mixed-configuration approximation based on single-band impurity solvers to efficiently study nonequilibrium multi-orbital systems at moderate computational cost. In this work, we merge the approach with the so-called auxiliary master equation approach. As benchmark, we first show that our approach reproduces the results of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for two-orbital impurity models at equilibrium with overall good accuracy, especially for non-degenerate orbitals. We then use our approach as impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to address the case of a two-orbital, realistic layered structure, recovering the strong crystal-field-driven charge polarization observed by solving the DMFT self-consistent cycle with QMC, albeit slightly reduced. Finally, we address a prototype nonequilibrium setup by sandwiching this layer between metallic contacts subject to a bias voltage described by different chemical potentials. This simplified model demonstrates out method's potential to access nonequilibrium steady-state behavior of multi-orbital, realistic materials. These findings provide a first-step basis for theoretical studies of nonequilibrium properties of multi-orbital compounds directly in the real frequency domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures.

Employing the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) technique, we can determine the magnetic ground states accurately and compare them to mean-field predictions to highlight the effects of quantum fluctuations. At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spin-triplet pairing instability in a two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09295v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model, from an unbiased numerical perspective.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures and appendix</p></details> |

The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages + appendix, 8 figures</p></details> |

NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ans\"atze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recent progress has shown that a broad class of highly correlated wavefunctions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.</p></details> |  |

This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</p></details> |  |

Expressing the bosonized Hamiltonian as a path integral over a scalar field enables the application of Monte Carlo algorithms developed for classical systems. Specifically, we focus on a dissipative XXZ spin chain, exhibiting critical slowing down, minima degeneracy and long-range interactions. Addressing all three bottlenecks, we design an algorithm that combines local persistent Event-Chain Monte Carlo moves with global cluster moves, in a O(1)-complexity implementation. Through systematic performance analysis, we show that such an algorithm outperforms traditional Metropolis algorithms by more than a magnitude factor and is competitive with current state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. We then use this approach to determine the dissipative spin chain's phase diagram, thereby reinforcing prior analytical predictions.</p></details> | fiexd typos |

| **[Superconducting properties of Fibonacci chains with enhanced superconducting pairing at the boundaries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02900v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the superconducting properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals have attracted considerable attention. By numerically solving the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for an $s-$wave superconducting Fibonacci chain, we find that the system exhibits universal end superconductivity, where the pair potential at the chain ends can persist at higher temperatures compared to the bulk critical temperature ($T_{cb}$) of the condensate in the chain center. Furthermore, our study reveals two distinct critical temperatures at the left ($T_{cL}$) and right ($T_{cR}$) ends of the chain. This complex behavior arises from the competition between topological bound states and critical states, a characteristic of quasicrystals. With the chosen parameters, the maximal enhancement of $T_{cR}$ reaches up to $66\%$ relative to $T_{cb}$, while $T_{cL}$ can increase by up to $31\%$. Our study sheds light on the phenomenon of end superconductivity in Fibonacci quasicrystals, pointing to alternative pathways for increasing the superconducting critical temperature.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in a Chern band: effect of time-reversal-symmetry breaking on superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16508v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-reversal-symmetry breaking is generally understood to be detrimental for superconductivity. However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $κ_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fragile superconductivity in a Dirac metal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01976v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying superconductivity in Dirac semimetals is an important step in understanding quantum matter with topologically non-trivial order parameters. We report on the properties of the superconducting phase in single crystals of the Dirac material LaCuSb2 prepared by the self-flux method. We find that chemical and hydrostatic pressure drastically suppress the superconducting transition. Furthermore, due to large Fermi surface anisotropy, magnetization and muon spin relaxation measurements reveal Type-II superconductivity for applied magnetic fields along the $a$-axis, and Type-I superconductivity for fields along the $c$-axis. Specific heat confirms the bulk nature of the transition, and its deviation from single-gap $s$-wave BCS theory suggests multigap superconductivity. Our tight-binding model points to an anisotropic gap function arising from the spin-orbital texture near the Dirac nodes, providing an explanation for the appearance of an anomaly in specific heat well below $T_c$. Given the existence of superconductivity in a material harboring Dirac fermions, LaCuSb2 proves an interesting material candidate in the search for topological superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 5 main figures, supplemental information attached</p></details> |
| **[From superconductivity to non-superconductivity in LiPdH: a first principle approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02252v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The layered structure of LiPdH was theoretically suggested to be a superconductor as a result of its larger electron-phonon coupling constant compared to that of PdH. However, the experimental results reported contrary findings, with no trace of superconductivity. We study the electronic, vibrational, and superconducting properties of the ambient pressure tetragonal phase of LiPdH ($P4/mmm$) within first principles density functional theory methods, both in the harmonic and anharmonic approximations for the lattice dynamics, and conclude that it does not show any superconducting behavior. High-pressure crystal structure prediction calculations indicate that no structural transition is expected to occur under pressure up to 100 GPa in LiPdH. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that increasing pressure reduces the density of states at the Fermi surface and consequently weakens electron-phonon interactions, leading to a further suppression of the superconducting critical temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnonic Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14756v4)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We uncover a new superconducting state with partial spin polarization induced by a magnetic field. This state, which we call "magnonic superconductor", lacks a conventional pairing order parameter, but is characterized instead by a composite order parameter that represents the binding of electron pairs and magnons. We rigorously demonstrate the existence of magnonic superconductivity with high transition temperature in one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models with repulsive interaction. We further show that magnonic Cooper pairs can attract to form higher-charge bound states, which can give rise to charge-$6e$ superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Nonreciprocal superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01681v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the notion of nonreciprocal superconductors where inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, giving rise to an asymmetric energy dispersion. We demonstrate that nonreciprocal superconductivity can be detected by Andreev reflection. In particular, a transparent junction between a normal metal and a nonreciprocal superconductor generally exhibits an asymmetric current-voltage characteristic, which serves as a defining feature of nonreciprocal superconductivity. Unlike the superconducting diode effects, our detection scheme has the advantage of avoiding large critical currents that turn the superconducting state to normal. Finally, we discuss candidates for nonreciprocal superconductivity, including graphene, UTe2, as well as engineered platforms.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in metallic hydrogen](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05554v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity, the lossless flow of electric current, occurs typically at very low temperatures. A possible exception is highly pressurized hydrogen, for which room temperature superconductivity has been predicted. However, as a result of various approximations used, conflicting theoretical predictions exist for the temperatures where superconductivity is expected to occur in highly pressurized hydrogen. Here we avoid those approximations and exploit the ``jellium'' model proposed in 1966 by De Gennes, where superconductivity involves the combination of Coulomb repulsion between the electrons and Coulomb attraction between the protons and the electrons. We confirm that metallic hydrogen should indeed exhibit superconductivity, but this is limited to temperatures far below previous estimates. We also find that the superconducting order develops over an energy range significantly exceeding the characteristic phonon energy, and that the phase of the order parameter flips 180 degrees at the characteristic phonon energy above and below the Fermi energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Emergence of Surface Superconductivity through Interference in Superconducting-proximity Topological Insulators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06232v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting-proximity topological insulators (STIs) have garnered significant research attention over the past two decades. In this Letter, we demonstrate that a low-dimensional STI in the topological-nontrivial phase (TP) exhibits an interference-induced surface (boundary) superconductivity with the surface critical temperature $T_{cs}$ significantly higher than the bulk one $T_{cb}$. Such a surface superconductivity is built due to the interference of the scattering quasiparticle states, rather than due to the presence of the topological bound states (TBSs). As the system goes deeper into the TP, the surface exhibits a crossover from the interference- to TBS-induced phase, where the surface enhancement of superconductivity is governed by the TBSs. Our study unveils a substantial variation in the maximal $T_{cs}$ along this crossover, attaining values being twice the maximal bulk critical temperature of the STI. Beyond shedding light on the nature of surface superconductivity in STIs, our study introduces a tangible method for experimentally manipulating their critical superconducting temperatures.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconducting nanowire diode](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11935v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiconducting diode with nonreciprocal transport effect underlies the cornerstone of contemporary integrated circuits (ICs) technology. Due to isotropic superconducting properties and the lack of breaking of inversion symmetry for conventional s-wave superconductors, such a superconducting peer is absent. Recently, a series of superconducting structures, including superconducting superlattice and quantum-material-based superconducting Josephson junction, have exhibited a superconducting diode effect in terms of polarity-dependent critical current. However, due to complex structures, these composite systems are not able to construct large-scale integrated superconducting circuits. Here, we demonstrated the minimal superconducting electric component-superconducting nanowire-based diode with a nonreciprocal transport effect under a perpendicular magnetic field, in which the superconducting to normal metallic phase transition relies on the polarity and amplitude of the bias current. Our nanowire diodes can be reliably operated nearly at all temperatures below the critical temperature, and the rectification efficiency at 2 K can be more than 24%. Moreover, the superconducting nanowire diode is able to rectify both square wave and sine wave signals without any distortion. Combining the superconducting nanowire-based diodes and transistors, superconducting nanowires hold the possibility to construct novel low-dissipation superconducting ICs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12298v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper serves as a primer on superconductivity, inviting students for further investigation. Although the theory of superconductivity is a many-body quantum theory, here we take a more didactic route based on thermodynamics and symmetry. We briefly survey the more than a century-old field and provide a one-sentence definition of a superconductor. Surprisingly, many textbooks lack such a definition, usually introducing superconductors through their properties rather than by definition. We explain the concept of an order parameter, symmetry, and symmetry breaking. Based on this, we clarify the difference between conventional and unconventional superconductors, which is frequently a confusing topic for newcomers. We provide the reader with a taste of a current research topic in the field of unconventional superconductivity and magnetism. For this, we explain the concept of time-reversal symmetry breaking in condensed matter physics, which is usually associated with a form of magnetism. Here, we show that time-reversal symmetry might be broken in superconductors, leading to magnetic properties due to superconductivity itself. For this purpose, we utilize the method of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for phase transitions. We discuss the field of chiral superconductivity and guide the interested reader to further study.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Superconducting Arcs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02900v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An essential ingredient for the production of Majorana fermions that can be used for quantum computing is the presence of topological superconductivity. As bulk topological superconductors remain elusive, the most promising approaches exploit proximity-induced superconductivity making systems fragile and difficult to realize. Weyl semimetals due to their intrinsic topology belong to potential candidates too, but search for Majorana fermions has always been connected with the superconductivity in the bulk, leaving the possibility of intrinsic superconductivity of the Fermi surface arcs themselves practically without attention, even from the theory side.Here, by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations, we unambiguously identify topological Fermi arcs on two opposing surfaces of the non-centrosymmetric Weyl material PtBi2. We show that these states become superconducting at different temperatures around 10K. Remarkably, the corresponding coherencepeaks appear as the strongest and sharpest excitations ever detected by photoemission from solids, suggesting significant technological relevance. Our findings indicate that topological superconductivity in PtBi2 occurs exclusively at the surface, which not only makes it an ideal platform to host Majorana fermions, but may also lead to a unique quantum phase - an intrinsic topological SNS Josephson junction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures and Supplementary Information</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity in the Fibonacci Chain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06157v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity was recently reported in several quasicrystalline systems. These are materials which are structurally ordered, but since they are not translationally invariant, the usual BCS theory does not apply. At the present time, the underlying mechanism and the properties of the superconducting phase are insufficiently understood. To gain a better understanding of quasiperiodic superconductors, we consider the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci chain, and examine its low-temperature superconducting phase in detail using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field approach. We obtain superconducting solutions as a function of the parameters controlling the physical properties of the system: the strength of the Hubbard attraction $U$, the chemical potential $μ$, and the strength of the modulation of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, $w$. We find that there is a bulk transition at a critical temperature that obeys a power law in $U$. The local superconducting order parameter is self-similar both in real and perpendicular space. The local densities of states vary from site to site, however, the width of the superconducting gap is the same on all sites. The interplay between the Hubbard attraction and the intrinsic gaps of the Fibonacci chain results in a complex zero-temperature $μ$-$U$ phase diagram with insulating domes surrounded by superconducting regions. Finally, we show that tuning $w$ from weak to strong quasicrystalline modulation gives rise to qualitatively different thermodynamic behaviors as could be observed by measuring the specific heat.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curvature-induced superconductivity enhancement for ultra-thin superconducting films](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14373v3)** | 2023-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive the linearized Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation for an ultra-thin superconducting film with curvature in a magnetic field. By introducing a novel transverse order parameter that varies slowly along the film, and applying the superconducting/vacuum boundary condition, we decouple the linearized GL equation into a transverse part and a surface part that includes the superconducting geometric potential (GP). The nucleation of the superconducting state in curved thin superconducting films can be equivalently described by the surface part equation. In the equivalent GL free energy of a curved superconducting film, the superconducting GP enables the film to remain in the superconducting state even when the superconducting parameter $ α$ turns positive by further reducing the quadratic term of the order parameter. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the phase transition of a rectangle thin superconducting film bent around a cylindrical surface. Our numerical results show that the superconducting GP enhances the superconductivity of the curved film by weakening the effect of the magnetic field, and the increase of the critical temperature, in units of the bulk critical temperature, is equal to the product of the negative superconducting GP and the square of the zero-temperature coherence length, which agrees with our theoretical predictions.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Orphan High Field Superconductivity in Non-Superconducting Uranium Ditelluride](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12392v1)** | 2023-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reentrant superconductivity is a phenomenon in which the destructive effects of magnetic field on superconductivity are mitigated, allowing a zero-resistance state to survive under conditions that would otherwise destroy it. Typically, the reentrant superconducting region derives from a zero-field parent superconductor. Here, we show that in specifically-prepared UTe$_2$ crystals, extremely large magnetic field gives rise to an unprecedented high field superconductor that lacks a zero-field parent phase. This orphan superconductivity exists at fields between 37 T and 52 T, over a smaller angular range than observed in superconducting UTe$_2$. The stability of field-induced orphan superconductivity is a challenge to existing theoretical explanations, and underscores the likelihood of a field-induced modification of the electronic structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Type III superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14673v1)** | 2023-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity remains one of most fascinating quantum phenomena existing on a macroscopic scale. Its rich phenomenology is usually described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory in terms of the order parameter, representing the macroscopic wave function of the superconducting condensate. The GL theory addresses one of the prime superconducting properties, screening of the electromagnetic field because it becomes massive within a superconductor, the famous Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Here we describe another widely-spread type of superconductivity where the Anderson-Higgs mechanism does not work and must be replaced by the Deser-Jackiw-Templeton topological mass generation and, correspondingly, the GL effective field theory must be replaced by an effective topological gauge theory. These superconductors are inherently inhomogeneous granular superconductors, where electronic granularity is either fundamental or emerging. We show that the corresponding superconducting transition is a three-dimensional (3D) generalization of the 2D Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) vortex binding-unbinding transition. The binding-unbinding of the line-like vortices in 3D results in the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) scaling of the resistance near the superconducting transition. We report experimental data fully confirming the VFT behavior of the resistance.</p></details> |  |

A superconducting transformer (SCT) is a suitable choice as a high DC current source for testing superconducting cables. In this work, we will present our experimental results of a SCT up to output current of 45 kA. The properties of this SCT is characterized at 4.2 K. Its behaviors during quenches at different current levels are studied.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Topologically enabled superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05360v2)** | 2022-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Majorana zero modes are a much sought-after consequence of one-dimensional topological superconductivity. Here, we show that, in turn, zero modes accompanying dynamical instanton events strongly enhance -- in some cases even enable -- superconductivity. We find that the dynamics of a one-dimensional topological triplet superconductor is governed by a $θ$ term in the action. For isotropic triplets, this term enables algebraic charge-$2e$ superconductivity, which is destroyed by fluctuations in nontopological superconductors. For anisotropic triplets, zero modes suppress quantum phase slips and stabilize superconductivity over a large region of the phase diagram. We present predictions of correlation functions and thermodynamics for states of topologically enhanced superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures; Accepted and revised version: the structure has been revised, the discussion of the anisotropic case has mostly been relegated to the appendix.

| **[Superconductivity in silicon: a review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03031v2)** | 2022-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Silicon, one of the most abundant elements found on Earth, has been an excellent choice of the semiconductor industry for ages. Despite it's remarkable applications in modern semiconductor-based electronic devices, the potential of cubic silicon in superconducting electronics remained a challenge because even heavily doped silicon crystals do not superconduct under normal conditions. It is apparent that if superconductivity can be introduced in cubic silicon, that will bring a breakthrough in low-dissipation electronic circuitry. Motivated by this, attempts have been made by several research groups to induce superconductivity in silicon through a number of different routes. Some of the other structural phases of silicon like $β$-Sn and simple hexagonal are, however, known to display superconductivity. In the present review article, various theoretical and experimental aspects of superconductivity in silicon are discussed. Superconductivity in different phases and different structural forms of silicon are also reviewed. We also highlight the potential of superconducting phases of silicon for technological applications in super-conducting nano-electronics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Nodal superconducting exchange coupling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07911v1)** | 2022-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting equivalent of giant magnetoresistance, involves placing a thin-film superconductor between two ferromagnetic layers. A change of magnetization-alignment in such a superconducting spin-valve from parallel (P) to antiparallel (AP) creates a positive shift in the superconducting transition temperature (ΔTc) due to an interplay of the magnetic exchange energy and the superconducting condensate. The magnitude of ΔTc scales inversely with the superconductor thickness (dS) and is zero when dS exceeds the superconducting coherence length (ξ) as predicted by de Gennes. Here, we report a superconducting spin-valve effect involving a different underlying mechanism that goes beyond de Gennes in which magnetization-alignment and ΔTc are determined by the nodal quasiparticle-excitation states on the Fermi surface of the d-wave superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-δ (YBCO) grown between insulating layers of ferromagnetic Pr0.8Ca0.2MnO3. We observe ΔTc values that approach 2 K with ΔTc oscillating with dS over a length scale exceeding 100 ξ and, for particular values of dS, we find that the superconducting state reinforces an antiparallel magnetization-alignment. These results pave the way for all-oxide superconducting memory in which superconductivity modulates the magnetic state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physical Mechanism of Superconductivity Part II Superconductivity and Superfluidity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07607v2)** | 2022-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transition mechanism of metal-insulator in metal oxides is discussed in detail, which is a part of the mechanism of superconductivity. Through the study of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene superconductor and other new findings on superconductivity, we further demonstrate that the physical mechanism of superconductivity proposed in Part I is the only correct way to handle the properties of superconductivity in various materials. We propose that superfluid helium consists of normal liquid helium mixed with high-energy helium atoms. Based on this new model, all peculiar features discovered in superfluid helium can be truly understood, such as the climb of superfluid helium on the container's wall, the fountain effect, the discontinuity of specific heat capacity at phase transition point, and the maintaining mass current in a ring-shaped container. We demonstrate that the high-energy particles play a driving force role in both superconductors and superfluid helium, and therefore dominate their properties.</p></details> | 29 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Lieb's Theorem for Bose Hubbard Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10319v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary finite-size lattice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of generalized Hubbard models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10314v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |
| **[$η$-pairing states in the Hubbard model with non-uniform Hubbard interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19786v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existence of $η$-pairing eigenstates in the fermionic Hubbard model is fundamentally rooted in the $η$-pairing symmetry, which may hold for systems with non-uniform Hubbard interaction $U$. In this work, we present a generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $η$-pairing symmetry. This allows us to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $η$% -pairing eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that the same quasi-$η$-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a way of the control of an $η$-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mott-Hubbard exciton in the optical conductivity of YTiO3 and SmTiO3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0608531v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Mott-Hubbard insulators YTiO3 and SmTiO3 we study optical excitations from the lower to the upper Hubbard band, d^1d^1 -> d^0d^2. The multi-peak structure observed in the optical conductivity reflects the multiplet structure of the upper Hubbard band in a multi-orbital system. Absorption bands at 2.55 and 4.15 eV in the ferromagnet YTiO3 correspond to final states with a triplet d^2 configuration, whereas a peak at 3.7 eV in the antiferromagnet SmTiO3 is attributed to a singlet d^2 final state. A strongly temperature-dependent peak at 1.95 eV in YTiO3 and 1.8 eV in SmTiO3 is interpreted in terms of a Hubbard exciton, i.e., a charge-neutral (quasi-)bound state of a hole in the lower Hubbard band and a double occupancy in the upper one. The binding to such a Hubbard exciton may arise both due to Coulomb attraction between nearest-neighbor sites and due to a lowering of the kinetic energy in a system with magnetic and/or orbital correlations. Furthermore, we observe anomalies of the spectral weight in the vicinity of the magnetic ordering transitions, both in YTiO3 and SmTiO3. In the G-type antiferromagnet SmTiO3, the sign of the change of the spectral weight at T_N depends on the polarization. This demonstrates that the temperature dependence of the spectral weight is not dominated by the spin-spin correlations, but rather reflects small changes of the orbital occupation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Stron...</summary><p>Strongly extended version; new data of SmTiO3 included; detailed discussion of temperature dependence included</p></details> |

| **[Hubbard parameters for programmable tweezer arrays](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03019v3)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The experimental realization of Fermi-Hubbard tweezer arrays opens a new stage for engineering fermionic matter, where programmable lattice geometries and Hubbard model parameters are combined with single-site imaging. In order to use these versatile experimental Fermi-Hubbard models as quantum simulators, it is crucial to know the Hubbard parameters describing them. Here we develop methods to calculate the Hubbard model parameters of arbitrary two-dimensional lattice geometries: the tunneling $t$, on-site potential $V$, and interaction $U$, for multiple bands and for both fermions and bosons. We show several examples. One notable finding is that a finite array of equally strong and separated individual tweezer potentials actually sums to give a non-periodic total potential and thus spatially non-uniform Hubbard parameters. We demonstrate procedures to find trap configurations that equalize these parameters. More generally, these procedures solve the inverse problem of calculating Hubbard parameters: given desired Hubbard parameters, find trap configurations to realize them. These methods will be critical tools for using tunnel-coupled tweezer arrays.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

The simplest model that one can investigate is an anyonic version of the bosonic Josephson junction, the repulsive anyon-Hubbard dimer. In the following we find an exact duality relation to the Bethe-solvable Bose-Hubbard dimer, which is well known from quantum optics and information theory and has interesting connections to spin squeezing and entangled coherent states. Conversely, we show that the anyonic Hubbard dimer has nontrivial coherence properties that emerge from the anyonic statistics. In particular, we find that coherences can be suppressed and amplified and show that these features are remarkably robust against additional repulsive on-site interactions highlighting the distinct nature of anyons.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, for more information and latest version see https://www.physik.uni-kl.de/eggert/papers/</p></details> |

Due to the absence of Umklapp cattering, the phase diagram displays finite regions for the three generic phases, namely, a Luttinger liquid metal for weak interactions, a Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant Hubbard interactions, and a charge-density-wave insulator for dominant nearest-neighbor interactions. Up to moderate interactions strengths, the quantum phase transitions between the metallic and insulating phases are continuous, i.e., the gap opens continuously as a function of the interaction strength. We conclude that generic short-range interactions do not change the nature of the Mott transition qualitatively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |

We consider the standard Hubbard model within DMFT approximation. As a typical case we consider the partially filled (hole doping) lower Hubbard band. We calculate the doping dependence of both the Hall coefficient and Hall number and determine the value of carrier concentration, where Hall effect changes its sign. We obtain a significant dependence of Hall effect parameters on temperature. Disorder effects are taken into account in a qualitative way.We also perform a comparison of our theoretical results with some known experiments on doping dependence of Hall number in the normal state of YBCO and Nd-LSCO, demonstrating rather satisfactory agreement of theory and experiment. Thus the doping dependence of Hall effect parameters obtained within Hubbard model can be considered as an alternative to a popular model of the quantum critical point.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, extended paper, short communication appeared as arXiv:2203.00542</p></details> |

Despite its simplicity, it exhibits a strikingly rich phenomenology which is reminiscent of that observed in quantum materials. Nevertheless, much of its phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we review a subset of what is known about the Hubbard model, based on exact results or controlled approximate solutions in various limits, for which there is a suitable small parameter. Our primary focus is on the ground state properties of the system on various lattices in two spatial dimensions, although both lower and higher dimensions are discussed as well.

Programmable potentials are highly flexible, with the ability to control the depth and shape of individual sites in the optical lattice dynamically. Quantum simulators of Hubbard models with (1) arbitrary basis are required to represent many real materials of contemporary interest, (2) broken translational symmetry are needed to study impurity physics, and (3) dynamical lattices are needed to investigate strong correlation out of equilibrium. We derive analytic expressions for Hubbard Hamiltonians in programmable potential systems. We find experimental parameters for quantum simulation of Hubbard models with arbitrary basis, concluding that programmable optical lattices are suitable for this purpose. We discuss how programmable optical lattices can be used for quantum simulation of dynamical multi-band Hubbard models that represent complicated compounds, impurities, and non-equilibrium physics.</p></details> |  |

Anyons can be considered to be a general category of particles that interpolate between fermions and bosons. We determined the position of the critical points of the one-dimensional anyon-Hubbard model, which was mapped to a modified Bose-Hubbard model where the tunneling depends on the local density and the interchange angle. We studied the latter model by using the density matrix renormalization group method and observed that gapped (Mott insulator) and gapless (superfluid) phases characterized the phase diagram, regardless of the value of the statistical angle. The phase diagram for higher densities was calculated and showed that the Mott lobes increase (decrease) as a function of the statistical angle (global density). The position of the critical point separating the gapped and gapless phases was found using quantum information tools, namely the block von Neumann entropy. We also studied the evolution of the critical point with the global density and the statistical angle and showed that the anyon-Hubbard model with a statistical angle $θ=π/4$ is in the same universality class as the Bose-Hubbard model with two body interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures.

As a paradigm, we consider a quarter filled square lattice Hubbard model whose free part is the $π$ flux state with topologically nontrivial and nearly-flat electron bands, which can realize either the Chern or $Z_2$ Hubbard model. By using the numerical exact diagonalization method with a projection onto the nearly-flat band, we obtain the ferromagnetic spin-1 excitation spectra for both the Chern and $Z_2$ Hubbard models, consisting of spin waves and Stoner continuum. The spectra exhibit quite distinct dispersions for both cases, in particular the spin wave is gapless for the Chern Hubbard model, while gapped for the $Z_2$ Hubbard model. Remarkably, in both cases, the nonflatness of the free electron bands introduces dips in the lower boundary of the Stoner continuum. It significantly renormalizes the energies of the spin waves around these dips downward and leads to roton-like spin excitations. We elaborate that it is the softening of the roton-like modes that destabilizes the ferromagnetic phase, and determine the parameter region where the ferromagnetic phase is stable.</p></details> | Accepted by PRB |

It targets, in principle exactly, the spectral function in addition to the electronic density. Here we examine the spectral potential in one of the simplest solvable models exhibiting a non-trivial interplay between electron-electron interaction and inhomogeneity, namely the asymmetric Hubbard dimer. We discuss a general strategy to introduce approximations, which consists in calculating the spectral potential in the homogeneous limit (here represented by the symmetric Hubbard dimer) and importing it in the real inhomogeneous system through a suitable "connector". The comparison of different levels of approximation to the spectral potential with the exact solution of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer gives insights about the advantages and the difficulties of this connector strategy for applications in real materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>Contr...</summary><p>Contribution to the Topical Issue "Special issue in honor of Hardy Gross", edited by C.A.

We employ dynamical mean field theory and study the paramagnetic metal-insulator transition, which has a very different nature for the two limiting models. Our results indicate that the metal-insulator transition rather resembles that of the Hubbard model as soon as a tiny hopping between the more localized fermions is switched on. At low temperatures we observe a first-order metal-insulator transition and a three peak structure. The width of the central peak is the same for the more and less mobile fermions when approaching the phase transition, which agrees with our expectation of a common Kondo temperature and phase transition for the two species.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Ferromagnetism in Hubbard Models: Low Density Route](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9502104v1)** | 2016-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thirty years ago the Hubbard model was introduced by Gutzwiller, Hubbard and Kanamori with the main purpose of mimicking the ferromagnetism of transition metals. Soon after, Nagaoka and Thouless pointed out a basic mechanism for ferromagnetism in strongly correlated electron systems by studying the motion of a single hole in a half--filled Hubbard model. This important work was hoped to shed light onto metallic ferromagnetism from the low doping regime. Unfortunately, this low doping route towards ferromagnetism has not been successful as far as rigorous results for finite doping concentrations are concerned. In the work presented here, we start from the opposite limit of low particle concentrations. In this limit we provide the first proof of a fully polarized metallic ground state for a Hubbard model. The proof proceeds by mapping Hubbard ``zigzag'' chains onto a continuum model with an additional degree of freedom and local first Hund's rule coupling. For this model the maximum total spin multiplet is shown to be the unique ground state for infinite Hubbard coupling. Our proof may open a low density route towards the understanding of the ferromagnetism of Hubbard models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, latex, in press in J.

This propagator is compared against the quantum Monte Carlo data obtained by Aimi and Imada [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 76}, 113708 (2007)] in the limit of strong electron-electron interaction. The Hubbard-I predictions are in a good qualitative agreement with the Monte Carlo results. In particular, $d$-wave correlations decay as $c r^{-3}$ ("free electron" behaviour), if separation $r$ exceeds 2-3 lattice constants. However, the Hubbard-I approximation underestimates coefficient $c$ by a factor of about three. We conclude that the Hubbard-I approximation, despite its simplicity and artefacts, captures the qualitative behaviour of the two-particle propagator for the Hubbard model, at least for moderate values of $r$.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures; the text is reorganized somewhat as compared to the preprint's previous version; an extra figure is added; some figures are re-drawn for different parameter values; typeset with IOP style</p></details> |

In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($δ\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

We argue that such random models capture qualitatively the strong local correlations needed to describe the cuprates and related compounds, while avoiding lattice space group symmetry breaking orders. The previously known spin glass ordered phase in the insulator at doping $p=0$ extends to a metallic spin glass phase up to a transition $p=p_c \approx 1/3$. The dynamic spin susceptibility shows signatures of the spectrum of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models near $p_c$. We also find signs of the phase transition in the entropy, entanglement entropy and compressibility, all of which exhibit a maximum near $p_c$. The electron energy distribution function in the metallic phase is consistent with a disordered extension of the Luttinger-volume Fermi surface for $p>p_c$, while this breaks down for $p<p_c$.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |
| **[Evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity in a bilayer $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07545v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $δ= 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $δ= 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15270v4)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06322v4)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $χ_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^α$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 4+12 figures</p></details> |
| **[Competing pair density wave orders in the square lattice $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19218v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last two decades, the competing orders in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates have been intensely studied, such as pseudogap phase, charge density waves (CDW), and pair density waves (PDW), which are thought to play a crucial role in high-temperature superconductivity. Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, we first explicitly identify a new sign structure in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the square lattice that replaces the conventional Fermi statistics for weakly interacting electrons. Then we show that the singular, i.e., the phase-string part of the sign structure in the partition function can be precisely turned off in a modified model. The density matrix renormalization group method is then employed to study these two models comparatively on finite-size systems, which is designed to unveil the consequences of the phase-string component. We find that the hole pairing is present not only in the quasi-long-range superconducting phase but also in the stripe phase of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model. However, once the phase-string is switched off, both the superconducting and stripe orders together with the underlying hole pairing disappear. The corresponding ground state reduces to a trivial Fermi-liquid-like state with small hole Fermi pockets that is decoupled from the antiferromagnetic spin background. It is in sharp contrast to the original $t$-$t'$-$J$ model where large Fermi surfaces can be restored in the stripe phase found at $t'/t<0$ or the superconducting phase at $t'/t>0$ in the six-leg ladder calculation. Our study clearly demonstrates that the strong correlation effect in doped Mott insulator should be mainly attributed to the long-range quantum entanglement between the spin and charge, which is, non-perturbatively, beyond a simple spin-charge separation under the no double occupancy constraint.</p></details> | 19 pages, 16 figures |

In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</p></details> | 5 + 5 pages |

Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

Based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify the ground-state phase diagram across varying inter-site interactions $V$ and doping concentration $δ$. We find that the phase diagram with finite inter-site interactions $2\lesssim V/J\lesssim3$ offers a more accurate description of electron-doped cuprates than the conventional Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models. Moreover, we reveal the role of inter-site interactions $V$ at varying doping levels: at light doping, inter-site interactions favor Néel antiferromagnetic order, and suppress both superconductivity and charge density wave; around optimal doping, these interactions support a pseudogap-like phase while suppressing superconductivity, and we further perform the slave boson mean-field analysis to understand the numerical results microscopically; at higher doping, the effects of inter-site interactions become insignificant, with our numerical predictions suggesting the emergence of incommensurate spin density wave phase. Our specific focus around optimal doping with various inter-site interactions identifies successive phases including phase separation, uniform $d$-wave SC and a pseudogap-like phase, and reveals a relative insensitivity of charge density wave to superconductivity. Our study suggests the $t$-$J$-$V$ model as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+9 p...</summary><p>7+9 pages, 6+10 figures</p></details> |

Using density functional theory calculations, we elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ by comprehensively analyzing structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics. Consistent with recent scanning transmission electron microscopy observations, we find an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at $-0.9\%$ strain, preceding superconductivity onset. Electronic analysis shows compressive strain lowers Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital energy levels, while interfacial Sr diffusion effectively reconstructs the $d_{z^2}$ pockets, quantitatively matching angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. The interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\perp$ under pressure or strain closely tracks experimental superconducting $T_c$ variation. The dome-shaped pressure dependence and monotonic strain dependence of $J_\perp$ mainly arise from modulations in the apical oxygen $p_z$ energy levels. Moreover, compressive strain suppresses both charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities analogous to pressure effects, with SDW vanishing concurrently with the structural transition and CDW disappearing at $\sim-3.3\%$ strain. Our results indicate that suppressed density waves and enhanced $J_\perp$ are crucial for both strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity. Accordingly, we propose several candidate substrates capable of achieving greater compressive strain, thereby potentially increasing $T_c$.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors.

In this respect, Sr-Ni-O RP-type phases represent alternative systems that exist with partial cation substitution. We demonstrate that by Y-doping in Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (SNAO), as Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (YSNAO), the drawback of an insulating ground state is overcome, and a significant decrease in resistivity is achieved with crystals exhibiting semiconducting behavior. We employ optical floating zone (OFZ) growth at 10 bar oxygen partial pressure to explore the phase formation in a narrow region of Y-Sr-Ni-Al-O and investigate via DFT the general stability of the pure Sr-Ni-O scenario. Using extensive diffraction and spectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the structural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and reduced compounds were investigated. The optimal growth of YSNAO allows for large high quality crystals suitable for neutron studies. In the Al-free growth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-δ}$, from which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed, opening the door for future exploration of \textit{A}-site substituted RP-type phases without Ni-site disorder.</p></details> |  |

Here, we address this by synthesizing high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$) with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice, particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$ rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm 2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the $c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/Å, demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Temperature dependent resistivity shows an upturn at low temperatures, but some clear instabilities, either due to structure or the releasing of strain between the film and substrate, occur at high temperatures. After annealing the films under high pressure of oxygen atmosphere, the upturn at low temperatures is strongly suppressed; the high temperature instability is completely removed. Hall effect measurements show a clear hole-charge carrier behavior with the carrier density of an order of magnitude higher compared with the undoped films. Surprisingly, it is found that the Hall coefficient is almost temperature independent in the whole temperature region, indicating the absence of multiband effect and suggesting the decoupling of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. This is contradicting to the rigid band picture of a bonding $d_{z^2}$ band just below the Fermi energy in the pristine sample.</p></details> |  |

Here we propose to broadly expand the choices of materials platforms to achieve high-Tc superconducting La3Ni2O7 films by proposing designer substrates of Ba1-xSrxO (x = 0 - 1) that allow to continuously tune the strain in the films from being tensile to compressive. Our systematic study of the structural and electronic reconstructions of the strained La3Ni2O7 bilayer film leads to the central finding that at the optimal tensile strain of ~2% (x ~0.25), the spectral weight of the Ni dz2 orbital is peaked right at the Fermi level, and its hybridization with the Ni dx2-y2 orbital is substantially enhanced. Consequently, the expected Tc should be unprecedentedly high, at least substantially higher than those achieved in the compressive regime. Furthermore, our detailed thickness-dependent energetic analyses show that such films can be stably grown for thicknesses equal to or beyond the bilayer regime, and predict that the SrO-terminated SrTiO3 should also be able to stabilize the films with optimal tensile strain and higher Tc's.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the superconducting gap amplitude and symmetry, the key parameters to characterize a superconductor, remain elusive due to the overwhelming challenges of gap studies under high pressure. Here, we introduce in situ directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation, differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors.

Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_2$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have reported superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-delta under pressure, with zero-resistance near 80 K, though the Meissner effect remains debated due to low superconducting volume fractions and limited high-pressure magnetic measurement techniques. In this work, we use diamond quantum sensors and four-probe detection to observe both zero resistance and the Meissner effect in the same La3Ni2O7-delta single crystal. By mapping the Meissner effect, we visualized superconducting regions and revealed sample inhomogeneities. Our combined magnetic and electrical measurements on the same crystal provide dual evidence of superconductivity, supporting the high-temperature superconductivity of La3Ni2O7-delta.

However, whether superconducting nickelate single crystals can be prepared at ambient pressure remains elusive. Here we report signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown from potassium carbonate flux at ambient pressure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations re-vealed high-quality single crystals with perfect stacking of trilayers. Resistivity measurements indicate that the metal-to-metal transition observed at ambient pressure was suppressed under high pressure, and a sharp drop occurred at ~30 K at 77.9 GPa, consistent with superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10 single crystals grown by the floating zone method at an oxygen pressure of >18 bar. Our results not only provide an important path to prepare high-quality nickelate single crystals but also support superconductivity in nickelates under high pressure, promoting more systematic and in-depth research in this compelling field.</p></details> | 3 figures |

Our numerical calculations indicate that interlayer pairing is dominant, resulting in an $s_\pm$-wave symmetry. We propose employing perpendicular electric fields, a practical method in thin film systems, to verify the pairing symmetry. Our calculations predict that such fields will induce Fermi arcs or nodal points and significantly modulate the gap near the diagonal, with the modulated region overlapping the area probed by ARPES. This approach provides an effective tool for probing pairing symmetry in bilayer nickelate thin films, especially given current limitations in experimental techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, including the supplemental material</p></details> |

Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule. These results suggest that the normal state of La3Ni2O7 to be a multiband metallic nature.</p></details> |  |

However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.</p></details> |  |

La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K under I4/mmm space group. The susceptibility measurements confirm bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Our research provides a new platform for the investigation of the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in Ruddlesden-Popper trilayer perovskite nickelates.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity. Our findings indicate that interlayer Coulomb interactions are crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, while zero resistance state has been observed, experimental characterization of the superconducting properties of pressurized nickelates is still limited and experimentally challenging. Here, we present the first full temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 measurement in La4Ni3O10 single crystal, achieved by combining high magnetic field and high-pressure techniques. Remarkably, the Hc2 of La4Ni3O10 is nearly isotropic, with the anisotropic parameter monotonically increasing from 1.4 near Tc to 1 at lower temperatures. By analyzing the Hc2 using the two-band model, we uncover that the anisotropic diffusivity of the bands, primarily originating from d(z2 ) and d(x2-y2 ) orbitals, is well compensated, resulting in an unusually isotropic superconducting state. These findings provide critical experimental evidence that underscores the significant role of the d(z2 ) orbital in enabling superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

It is believed that the density wave (DW) at ~150 K plays an important role in SC emergence, but its nature remains largely underexplored. Here, we utilized temperature-dependent in-situ Ni K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to probe the Ni-3d/4p electronic states of La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta samples down to 4.8 K, enabling us to witness the evolution of both in-plane d_(x^2-y^2)/p_x (p_y) and out-of-plane d_(3z^2-r^2)/p_z orbitals of NiO6 octahedron across the DW transition. Main edge energy associated with Ni 4p orbital shows an anomalous decline near DW transition, signifying the occurrence of lattice distortions as a hallmark of charge density wave. Below DW transition, the enlarged crystal field splitting (CFS) indicates an enhanced NiO6 octahedral distortion. Intriguingly, magnetic Pr substituents could activate the mutual interplay of d_(x^2-y^2) and d_(3z^2-r^2) orbitals. We discussed its relevance to the favored bulk SC in the pressurized polycrystalline La2PrNi2O7-delta than pristine.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

An important aspect of investigating electronic structures is discerning the extent to which the electronic ground state of La3Ni2O7-δ resembles the parent state of the cuprate superconductor, a charge transfer insulator with long-range antiferromagnetism. Through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we have uncovered the crucial influence of oxygen ligands on the electronic ground states of the Ni ions, displaying a charge transfer nature akin to cuprate but with distinct orbital configurations. Both in-plane and out-of-plane Zhang-Rice singlets associated with Ni d_(x^2-y^2 ) and d_(z^2) orbitals are identified, together with a strong interlayer coupling through inner apical oxygen. Additionally, in La3Ni2O7-δ films, we have detected a superlattice reflection (1/4, 1/4, L) at the Ni L absorption edge using resonant X-ray scattering measurements. Further examination of the resonance profile indicates that the reflection originates from the Ni d orbitals. By evaluating the reflection's azimuthal angle dependence, we have confirmed the presence of collinear antiferromagnetic spin ordering and charge-like anisotropy ordered with the same periodicity. Notably, our findings reveal a microscopic relationship between these two components in the temperature dependence of the scattering intensity of the reflection. This investigation enriches our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-δ under high pressure.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15322v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $χ^b > χ^a > χ^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $χ^a > χ^c > χ^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

This heavy-fermion paramagnet was rapidly identified as a reference compound to study the interplay between magnetism and unconventional superconductivity with multiple degrees of freedom. The proximity to a ferromagnetic quantum phase transition was initially proposed as a driving force to triplet-pairing superconductivity. However, we find here that long-range incommensurate antiferromagnetic order is established under pressure. The propagation vector km = (0.07,0.33,1) of the antiferromagnetic phase is close to a wavevector where antiferromagnetic fluctuations have previously been observed at ambient pressure. These elements support that UTe2 is a nearly-antiferromagnet at ambient pressure. Our work appeals for theories modelling the evolution of the magnetic interactions and electronic properties, driving a correlated paramagnetic regime at ambient pressure to a long-range antiferromagnetic order under pressure. A deeper understanding of itinerant-f-electrons magnetism in UTe2 will be a key for describing its unconventional superconducting phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article: 17 pages, 4 figures, 64 references Supplementary Information: 6 pages, 6 figures, 7 references</p></details> |

In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band (TSB), which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor, and also distinguish a chiral from non-chiral $Δ_k$ via enhanced s-wave proximity. Here we employ s-wave superconductive scan-tips and detect intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging reveals sub-gap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a-axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity, signifies that $Δ_k$ of UTe2 is a non-chiral state: B1u, B2u or B3u. However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a-axis is internodal, then a non-chiral B3u state is the most consistent for UTe2.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 figures, to appear in Science (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Anisotropic field-induced changes in the superconducting order parameter of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04938v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UTe2 is a newly discovered unconventional superconductor, where electron Cooper pairs combine into a spin-triplet ground state. Here we report the specific heat C(H,T) of a high-quality single crystal of UTe2 with a single specific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition temperature T_c {\approx} 2 K and a small zero-field residual Sommerfeld coefficient γ_0 = C/T (T=0) = 10 mJ/mol-K^2. We applied magnetic field up to 12 T along the three principal crystallographic axes of UTe2 to probe the nature of the superconducting state. The evolution of the residual Sommerfeld coefficient as a function of magnetic field, γ_0 (H), is highly anisotropic and reveals distinct regions. In magnetic field up to 4 T applied along a, b, and c axes, we find γ_0{\approx}α_i {\square}H, with i=a,b,c, as expected for an unconventional superconductor with nodes (zeros) of the superconducting order parameter on the Fermi surface. A pronounced kink in γ_0(H), however, is observed at roughly 4 T for field applied along both a and b axes, whereas a smooth change from square-root to linear behaviour is observed at 4 T for H//c. These results strongly indicate that a zero-field ground state is stable up to 4 T and undergoes a field-induced evolution above 4 T. {α_c} > {α_a} > {α_b}, indicating that the nodes in the low-field state are predominantly located in the vicinity of the a-b plane. The modification of the order parameter is strongest when field is applied in the a-b plane, which causes nodes to move away from the direction of the applied field. Both d_(B_2u)+id_(B_1u) and d_(B_2u)+id_(A_u) two-component order parameters can account for our observations, with d_(B_2u)+id_(B_1u) a more likely candidate. In either scenario, our measurements indicate that B_2u is the primary superconducting order parameter in UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Yin-Yang vortex on UTe2 (011) surface](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21506v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UTe2 is a promising candidate for spin-triplet superconductor, yet its exact superconducting order parameter remains highly debated. Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Electronic dimensionality of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15435v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in the heavy-fermion metal UTe2 survives the application of very high magnetic fields, presenting both an intriguing puzzle and an experimental challenge. The strong, non-perturbative influence of the magnetic field complicates the determination of superconducting order parameters in the high-field phases. Here, we report electronic transport anisotropy measurements in precisely aligned microbars in magnetic fields to 45 T applied along the b-axis. Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter. A pair-density-wave-like state at high fields could naturally induce a layered modulation of the superfluid density, forming planar structures that confine vortices and guide their sliding in the flux-flow regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surface charge density wave in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12505v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</p></details> |  |

The pairing symmetry of recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor UTe2 featuring an exceedingly large upper critical field has attracted a great deal of attention. Even though it is widely believed that UTe2 possesses an odd-parity, spin-triplet pairing symmetry, direct evidence for it is lacking, especially at zero or low magnetic fields. We report here the selection-rule results of Josephson coupling between In, an s-wave superconductor, and UTe2. The orientation dependence of the Josephson coupling suggests very strongly that UTe2 possess an odd-parity pairing state of B_1u in zero magnetic fields. We also report the formation of Andreev surface bound states on the (1-10) surface of UTe2.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In Kondo lattice systems, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon Knight shift have proven to be particularly sensitive to the properties of the developing heavy-electron fluid. Here we report muon Knight shift measurements on high-quality UTe2 single crystals grown by a molten salt-flux method. Together with previous data from a single crystal grown by a chemical-vapor transport method, our results show the contribution of the heavy-electron liquid to the muon Knight shift increases below a crossover temperature T* ~ 30 K in accord with a universal scaling function of T/T* for heavy-fermion materials. An observed departure from this universal scaling below a temperature T ~ 12 K at certain muon stopping sites signifies a reversal of the Kondo hybridization and a relocalization of U 5f moments with an antiferromagnetic coupling. The preservation of universal scaling at a different muon site demonstrates a coexistence of itinerant and localized 5f electron states preceding the superconducting phase transition.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[High Field Superconducting Phases of Ultra Clean Single Crystal UTe2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21689v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the magnetoresistance of high-quality single crystals of UTe2 with Tc=2.1K in high magnetic fields up to 36T, with the field direction between the b and c-axes. From the angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2, we found that the field-reentrant superconducting phase near H // b-axis extends up to a field angle (24 deg) from the b to c-axis, where another field-reentrant superconducting phase begins to appear above the metamagnetic transition field, Hm. Our results suggest that the field-reentrant superconductivity below Hm near the b-axis is closely related to the superconductivity above Hm when the field is tilted toward the c-axis. Superconductivity appears to be robust when the field direction is maintained perpendicular to the magnetization easy axis, implying that fluctuations boosting superconductivity may persist. At first glance, these findings resemble the field-reentrant (reinforced) superconductivity observed in ferromagnetic superconductors URhGe and UCoGe, where Ising-type ferromagnetic fluctuations play a crucial role. However, in UTe2, the fluctuations are more complex. The angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 contrasts with that of the initial slope of Hc2 near Tc, revealing the anisotropic field response of fluctuations. Thanks to the high-quality samples, quantum oscillations were detected for field directions close to the c-axis using magnetoresistance (Shubnikov-de Haas effect) and torque (de Haas-van Alphen effect) measurements. The angular dependence of frequencies is in good agreement with those observed previously using the field-modulation technique, confirming quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in J.

| **[Absence of a Bulk Thermodynamic Phase Transition to a Density Wave Phase in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14714v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competing and intertwined orders are ubiquitous in strongly correlated electron systems, such as the charge, spin, and superconducting orders in the high-Tc cuprates. Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements provide evidence for a charge density wave (CDW) that coexists with superconductivity in the heavy Fermion metal UTe2. This CDW persists up to at least 7.5 K and, as a CDW breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice, its disappearance is necessarily accompanied by thermodynamic phase transition. Here, we report high-precision thermodynamic measurements of the elastic moduli of UTe2. We observe no signature of a phase transition in the elastic moduli down to a level of 1 part in 10^7, strongly implying the absence of bulk CDW order in UTe2. We suggest that the CDW and associated pair density wave (PDW) observed by STM may be confined to the surface of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

Though UTe2 is considered to be a heavy fermion material, only light-electron Fermi surfaces have been compellingly identified, while a possible heavy electron Fermi surface near the momentum space Z-point has been the subject of more speculative and incongruent interpretations based on density functional theory (DFT+U) and experimental measurements. Here we explore the DFT+U band structure within a tight binding model framework to identify emergence mechanisms for heavy fermion Fermi surfaces. Applying a Gutzweiller-like renormalization term to f-electron kinetics is found to distort the lowest energy f electron band from a saddle point to a local minimum at the Z-point, introducing a shallow Fermi pocket and greatly improving compatibility with recent experiments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Understanding how these density waves emerge, or conversely get suppressed by external parameters, provides an important insight into their nature. Here we use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study the evolution of density waves in the heavy fermion spin-triplet superconductor UTe2 as a function of temperature and magnetic field. We discover that charge modulations, composed of three different wave vectors gradually weaken but persist to a surprisingly high temperature T_CDW ~ 10-12 K. By tracking the local amplitude of modulations, we find that these modulations become spatially inhomogeneous, and form patches that shrink in size with higher temperature or with applied magnetic field. Interestingly, one of the density wave vectors along the mirror symmetry has a slightly different temperature onset, thus revealing an unexpected decoupling of the three-component CDW state. Importantly, T_CDW determined from our work matches closely to the temperature scale believed to be related to magnetic fluctuations, providing the first possible connection between density waves observed by surface probes and bulk measurements. Combined with magnetic field sensitivity of the modulations, this could point towards an important role of spin fluctuations or short-range magnetic order in the formation of the primary charge density wave.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molten Salt Flux Liquid Transport Method for Ultra Clean Single Crystals UTe2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12740v2)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various single crystal growth techniques are presented for the unconventional superconductor UTe2. The molten salt flux liquid transport (MSFLT) method is employed to grow high-quality and large single crystals, exhibiting a high residual resistivity ratio (RRR = 200-800). On the other hand, the Te self-flux and chemical vapor transport (CVT) method produces samples of lower quality. The MSFLT method is a hybrid approach that combines the molten salt flux (MSF) and CVT methods. One significant advantage is that the materials gradually crystallize at the relatively low temperature which is fixed during the main process. This might be crucial for preventing U deficiency and obtaining high-quality and large single crystals of UTe2. Many different single crystals obtained by different technique were characterized by resistivity, specific heat measurements. The superconducting transition temperature decreases with the residual resistivity, followed by the Abrikosov-Gor'kov pair breaking theory. The highest quality sample reaches Tc=2.1K. The residual gamma-value of specific heat for the highest quality sample is only 3 percents of the normal state gamma-value. The specific heat jump, Delta C/(gamma Tc) reaches about 2.7 for high quality samples, indicating a strong coupling superconductor.

Braithwaite et al., Commun. Phys. 2, 147 (2019)]. The clarification of pairing mechanisms and symmetries of gap functions are essentially important for understanding the multiple-phase diagram. Since the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations with Ising-like anisotropy is suggested from measurements of magnetic susceptibilities and neutron scattering measurements, it is expected that the interplay between these spin fluctuations plays a crucial role in the emergence of the multiple superconducting phases. Motivated by these observations, we examine the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing mechanism, analyzing the linearized Eliashberg equations for an effective model of f-electron bands. It is found that the Ising-like ferromagnetic fluctuations stabilize spin-triplet pairings in either the Au or B3u states, whereas Ising-like antiferromagnetic fluctuations stabilize spin-triplet pairings in the B1u state. These results provide a plausible scenario elucidating the multiple superconducting phases under pressure.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

These excitations originate from the U $5f^2$ configuration, which is unexpected since the short Te2-Te2 distances exclude Te2 being 2-. By utilizing the photoionization cross-section dependence of the photoemission spectra in combination with band structure calculations, we infer that the stabilization of the U $5f^2$ configuration is due to the U $6d$ bonding states in the U-dimers acting as a charge reservoir.

In contrast to previous muSR studies of UTe2 single crystals grown by a chemical vapour transport (CVT) method, we find no evidence of magnetic clusters or electronic moments fluctuating slow enough to cause a discernible relaxation of the zero-field muSR asymmetry spectrum. Consequently, our measurements on MSF-grown single crystals rule out the generation of spontaneous magnetic fields in the bulk that would occur near impurities or lattice defects if the superconducting state of UTe2 breaks time-reversal symmetry. This result suggests UTe2 is characterized by a single-component superconducting order parameter.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |

The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+3 p...</summary><p>9+3 pages, 10 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, experimental signatures of loop current order remain elusive. In this work, based on the mean-field free energy, we analyze the collective modes of unconventional CDW order in a Kagome lattice model. Furthermore, we point out that phase modes in the imaginary CDW (iCDW) order with loop current orders result in time-dependent stray fields.

| **[Loop-current order through the kagome looking glass](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16657v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In loop-current states, interacting electronic degrees of freedom collectively establish interatomic currents, in a rare example of magnetism in which spin degrees of freedom do not play the primary role. The main impact of such states on the electronic spectrum is not via the standard Zeeman term, but via the kinetic energy, in which hopping parameters develop non-trivial phases that break time-reversal symmetry. The recent proposal of loop-current states in kagome superconductors has stimulated renewed interest in this exotic type of magnetism. In this perspective, we use kagome materials as a scaffolding to frame the basic phenomenology of loop-current states. We provide an overview of the group-theoretical properties of loop currents, as well as of relevant microscopic models and ab initio methods. Particular emphasis is given to the comparison with spin-density waves in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, as well as to the anharmonic coupling with charge-density waves, which is present in systems with threefold rotational symmetry. We also provide a brief overview of the current status of loop-current order in kagome metals and discuss open challenges including their experimental detection and interplay with other orders.</p></details> | perspective paper |

We study eigenstates which are characterised by cyclic supercurrents per each triangular plaquette ("loop" states). For noninteracting systems we find at least three classes of loop eigenmodes: standard; chaotic and periodic. Standard modes are those inherited from the basic three-site ring of condensates with phase differences locked to $2π/3$. Standard modes become unstable in the interacting system but only when the interaction exceeds a certain critical value $u_c$. Chaotic modes are characterised by very different circular currents per plaquette, so that the usual symmetry of loop currents is broken. Circular supercurrents associated with chaotic modes become chaotic for any finite interaction, signalling the loss of coherence between the condensates. Periodic modes are described by alternating populations and two different phase differences. The modes are self-similar and are present in all generations of Sierpinski gasket. When the interaction is included, the circular current of such a mode becomes periodic in time with the amplitude growing linearly with the interaction. Above a critical interaction the amplitude saturates signalling a transition to a macroscopic self-trapping state originally known from a usual Bose Josephson junction. We perform a systematic analysis of this rich physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 16 figures, typos corrected, additional explanations added, additional figures</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity due to fluctuating loop currents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18019v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Orbital magnetism and the loop currents (LC) that accompany it have been proposed to emerge in many systems, including cuprates, iridates, and kagome superconductors. In the case of cuprates, LCs have been put forward as the driving force behind the pseudogap, strange-metal behavior, and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity. Here, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can cause unconventional superconductivity. For odd-parity LCs, we find that they are strongly repulsive in all pairing channels near the underlying quantum-critical point (QCP). For even-parity LCs, their fluctuations do give rise to unconventional pairing. However, this pairing is not amplified in the vicinity of the QCP, in sharp contrast to other known cases of pairing mediated by intra-unit-cell order parameters, such as spin-magnetic, nematic, or ferroelectric ones. Applying our formalism to the cuprates, we conclude that pairing mediated by fluctuating intra-unit-cell LCs is unlikely to yield $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity. We also show that loop currents, if relevant for the cuprates, must vary between unit cells and break translation symmetry.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

We confirm that they do not give rise to a Kac-Moody algebra (for $n\neq 2$), a result expected from the underlying lack of unitarity. By studying four-point functions in detail, we fully determine the current-current OPEs, and thus obtain several structure constants with physical meaning. We find in particular that the terms $:\!J\bar{J}\!:$ in the identity and adjoint channels vanish exactly, invalidating the argument made in \cite{car93-1} that adding orientation-dependent interactions to the model should lead to continuously varying exponents in self-avoiding walks. We also determine the residue of the identity channel in the $JJ$ two-point function, finding that it coincides both with the result of a transfer-matrix computation for an orientation-dependent correlation function in the lattice model, and with an earlier Coulomb gas computation of Cardy \cite{car93}. This is, to our knowledge, one of the first instances where the Coulomb gas formalism and the bootstrap can be successfully compared.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, v2: clarifications on a few points and improved presentation</p></details> |

The correlated disorder is introduced in site energies of the ring in the form of Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model. Simulating the quantum system within a tight-binding framework all the results are worked out based on the standard wave-guide theory. Unlike transport current, commonly referred to drain current, circular current in the loop conductor can get enhanced with increasing disorder strength. This enhancement becomes much effective when hopping dimerization is included which is taken following the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. The characteristic features of bias driven circular current are studied under different input conditions and we find the results are robust for wide range of physical parameters. Our analysis may provide a new insight in analyzing transport behavior in different disordered lattices in presence of additional restrictions in hopping integrals.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures (comments are welcome)</p></details> |
| **[Spin loop-current textures in Hubbard models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13557v2)** | 2023-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent experimental observations of loop current in Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7}$, and Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ have inspired a theoretical study that broadly redefines loop current as a manifestation of quantum liquid crystals. Using the density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the emergence of spin loop-current (sLC) textures in carrier-doped (i) excitonic insulators, (ii) orbital-selective Mott insulators, and (iii) two-dimensional Mott insulators, modeled by a two-orbital Hubbard model on a ladder lattice in (i) and (ii) and a single-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice in (iii). Calculating the spatial distribution of spin current around a bond to which a pinning field is applied, we find conditions for longer-ranged sLC correlations. In system (i), when using the model parameters employed to describe the excitonic condensation, we find that a sLC texture appears near half filling, associated with an excitonic condensation in a spin channel. In system (ii), using typical sets of model parameters for BaFe$_{2}$Se$_{3}$, we find that a sLC texture appears at electron fillings where a block-type antiferromagnetism develops. In system (iii), introducing a next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'\sim -0.25$ (in units of the nearest-neighbor hopping) suggested for high-$T_\text{c}$ cuprates, we find that an axial-sLC texture emerges at hole-carrier density $δ=0.125$, where the charge stripe simultaneously appears.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Local magnetic moments due to loop currents in metals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.05587v2)** | 2022-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Hartree-Fock calculations on a simple model to obtain the conditions of formation of local magnetic moments due to loop-currents $L_o$ and spin-loop currents $L_s$ and compare them to the conditions of formation of local spin-moments $M$ which were given long ago in a similar approximation by Anderson. A model with three degenerate orbitals sitting on an equilateral triangle, with on-site and nearest-neighbor repulsions $U$ and $V$ respectively, and inter-site kinetic energy, hybridizing with conduction electrons with a parameter $Δ$ is investigated. $L_o$ and $L_s$ are promoted by large $V/Δ$ and their magnitude is relatively unaffected by $U/Δ$. Spin-magnetic moments $M$ promoted by large $U/Δ$ on the other hand are adversely affected by $V/Δ$. In this model, $L_o$ for $V$ multiplied by the number of neighbors is approximately the same as the $M$ promoted by $U$ in Anderson's local model for $M$. $L_o$ and $L_s$ are degenerate if exchange interactions and Hund's rule are neglected but $L_o$ is favored when they are included. Many of the qualitative results are visible in an expression for the Hartree-Fock ground state energy derived as a function of small $L_o, L_s$ and $M$. Numerical minimization of the Hartree-Fock energy is presented for larger values. We also briefly discuss the connection and differences of the interaction generated orbital currents and spin-currents discussed here and generalized to a lattice with the topological states in metals and semi-conductors.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Polarized neutron diffraction experiments have provided compelling evidences supporting a new form of intra-unit-cell magnetism, emerging concomitantly with the so-called pseudogap state of these materials. This observation is currently interpreted as the magnetic hallmark of an intra-unit-cell loop current order, breaking both parity and time-reversal symmetries. More generally, this magneto-electric state is likely to exist in a wider class of quantum materials beyond superconducting cuprates.

| **[Splitting of energy levels of Spin-vortex Induced Loop Currents by feeding external currents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12537v1)** | 2021-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spin-vortex-induced loop current (SVILC) is a nano-sized loop current predicted to exist in the CuO$_2$ plane in the bulk of hole-doped cuprate superconductors. It is a persistent loop current protected by the topological winding number associated with the wave function. It exists around a spin-vortex created by the itinerant electrons with a doped hole at its center. The direction of each SVILC can be either clockwise (winding number is -1) or counterclockwise (winding number is +1) and the winding number with no current (winding number is zero) is forbidden by the singlevalued requirement of the wave function with respect to the electron coordinates. Recently, it has been demonstrated, theoretically, that this degree-of-freedom can be used for qubits. Coupling of neighboring qubits by external current feeding is confirmed to be realizable. This means that nano-sized couplers of SVILC qubits using feeding external currents are realizable. The size of couplers of SVILC qubits can be conparable or smaller than that of trapped ion qubits. Couper size of SVILC qubits is decided by the range of spin vortices in CuO$_2$ plane and current distribution, thus, this is tunable by feeding external current and substituting Cu atoms in barrier atoms. That of trapped ion qubits is limited by the distance that combined vibration occurs or laser range with respect to the coordinates. In the present work, We demonstrated splitting energy levels by external feeding current of three qubit system of SVILC qubits. This means that nano-sized qubit differentiator can be realized, and noise by static magnetic field can be cut off, and this may enable the realizing fully-fault tolerant quantum computers by SVILC qubits. Moreover, the possibility of downscaling of them is shown.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 16 figures, 2 table</p></details> |

Each current loop consists of an interlayer current flowing through the open AA stacked regions of the moiré created by rotation, which then flows back through the neighboring AB regions to form a circuit, with significant current strength even at small fields. Similar moiré ordered arrays of current loops are also shown to exist in non-equilibrium transport states, where they manifest as current back flowing against the applied bias in the device. Such current loops thus represent an intrinsic feature of the twist bilayer in conditions of broken time reversal symmetry, and exist both as a low field imprint of the moiré lattice on Landau physics, and as measurable moiré scale current configurations in transport states.</p></details> |  |

This effect is rooted on the glide-plane symmetry of these materials and on the existence of an atomic spin-orbit coupling that couples states at the $X$ and $Y$ points of the 1-Fe Brillouin zone. In the particular case in which the magnetic moments are aligned parallel to the magnetic ordering vector direction which is the moment configuration most commonly found in the iron-based superconductors these loop currents involve the $d_{xy}$ orbital and either the $d_{yz}$ orbital (if the moments point along the $y$ axis) or the $d_{xz}$ orbitals (if the moments point along the $x$ axis). We show that the two main manifestations of the orbital loop currents are the emergence of magnetic moments in the pnictide/chalcogen site and an orbital-selective band splitting in the magnetically ordered state, both of which could be detected experimentally. Our results highlight the unique intertwining between orbital and spin degrees of freedom in the iron-based superconductors, and reveal the emergence of an unusual correlated phase that may impact the normal state and superconducting properties of these materials.</p></details> |  |

This method integrates memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems. The method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the moments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as matrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively. Crucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved through an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the spectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the method to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all cases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG) benchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational efficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These findings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for simulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

We introduce two core operators derived from this framework: \emph{Tensor Attention}, which models complex token-mixing via data-dependent polynomial kernels, and Tensor Interaction, a novel mechanism for adaptive channel-mixing. We demonstrate that these operators are powered by second-order summaries that entirely bypass the formation of $n \times n$ matrices, enabling a causality-preserving streaming implementation with $O(d^2)$ per-token updates and $O(d^2)$ state. This efficiency rivals that of modern State Space Models while retaining an attention-like formulation. The Deep Tensor Network thus provides a principled and powerful new class of building blocks for next-generation sequence models, bridging the gap between scalable computation and rich, expressive interaction modeling.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</p></details> |  |

By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 Figures, submitted to Quantum Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Conventional DMRG and MPS methods frequently encounter limitations when dealing with subtle quantum correlations and entanglement structures near critical points, avoided crossings, and topologically ordered phases. By integrating the dynamical Uhlmann gauge potential and its categorical extensions into the numerical optimization and truncation procedures, our approach substantially improves coherence stability and accuracy. Through illustrative applications in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum dynamics, we demonstrate significant enhancements in precision and reliability, underscoring the broad potential of Uhlmann gauge-enhanced computational methods.</p></details> |  |

In addition, the method benefits from the reuse of intermediate calculations.

| **[Integrating Neural Networks and Tensor Networks for Computing Free Energy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12037v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing free energy is a fundamental problem in statistical physics. Recently, two distinct methods have been developed and have demonstrated remarkable success: the tensor-network-based contraction method and the neural-network-based variational method. Tensor networks are accu?rate, but their application is often limited to low-dimensional systems due to the high computational complexity in high-dimensional systems. The neural network method applies to systems with general topology. However, as a variational method, it is not as accurate as tensor networks. In this work, we propose an integrated approach, tensor-network-based variational autoregressive networks (TNVAN), that leverages the strengths of both tensor networks and neural networks: combining the variational autoregressive neural network's ability to compute an upper bound on free energy and perform unbiased sampling from the variational distribution with the tensor network's power to accurately compute the partition function for small sub-systems, resulting in a robust method for precisely estimating free energy. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted numerical experiments on spin glass systems with various topologies, including two-dimensional lattices, fully connected graphs, and random graphs. Our numerical results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method compared to existing approaches. In particular, it effectively handles systems with long-range interactions and leverages GPU efficiency without requiring singular value decomposition, indicating great potential in tackling statistical mechanics problems and simulating high-dimensional complex systems through both tensor networks and neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loop Series Expansions for Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03108v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Belief propagation (BP) can be a useful tool to approximately contract a tensor network, provided that the contributions from any closed loops in the network are sufficiently weak. In this manuscript we describe how a loop series expansion can be applied to systematically improve the accuracy of a BP approximation to a tensor network contraction, in principle converging arbitrarily close to the exact result. More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 6 pages, 5 figures.

This library provides almost an identical interface and syntax for both C++ and Python, allowing users to effortlessly switch between two languages. Aiming at a quick learning process for new users of tensor network algorithms, the interfaces resemble the popular Python scientific libraries like NumPy, Scipy, and PyTorch. Not only multiple global Abelian symmetries can be easily defined and implemented, Cytnx also provides a new tool called Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform tensor network contractions in an optimal order automatically. With the integration of cuQuantum, tensor calculations can also be executed efficiently on GPUs. We present benchmark results for tensor operations on both devices, CPU and GPU. We also discuss features and higher-level interfaces to be added in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compactifying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00627v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gauging tensor networks with belief propagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17837v5)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively compressing and optimizing tensor networks requires reliable methods for fixing the latent degrees of freedom of the tensors, known as the gauge. Here we introduce a new algorithm for gauging tensor networks using belief propagation, a method that was originally formulated for performing statistical inference on graphical models and has recently found applications in tensor network algorithms. We show that this method is closely related to known tensor network gauging methods. It has the practical advantage, however, that existing belief propagation implementations can be repurposed for tensor network gauging, and that belief propagation is a very simple algorithm based on just tensor contractions so it can be easier to implement, optimize, and generalize. We present numerical evidence and scaling arguments that this algorithm is faster than existing gauging algorithms, demonstrating its usage on structured, unstructured, and infinite tensor networks. Additionally, we apply this method to improve the accuracy of the widely used simple update gate evolution algorithm.</p></details> | 45 Pages. 11 Figures |
| **[Sign problem in tensor network contraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19023v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</p></details> | accepted version |
| **[Chemical master equation parameter exploration using DMRG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09692v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Well-mixed chemical reaction networks (CRNs) contain many distinct chemical species with copy numbers that fluctuate in correlated ways. While those correlations are typically monitored via Monte Carlo sampling of stochastic trajectories, there is interest in systematically approximating the joint distribution over the exponentially large number of possible microstates using tensor networks or tensor trains. We exploit the tensor network strategy to determine when the steady state of a seven-species gene toggle switch CRN model supports bistability as a function of two decomposition rates, both parameters of the kinetic model. We highlight how the tensor network solution captures the effects of stochastic fluctuations, going beyond mean field and indeed deviating meaningfully from a mean-field analysis. The work furthermore develops and demonstrates several technical advances that will allow steady-states of broad classes of CRNs to be computed in a manner conducive to parameter exploration. We show that the steady-state distributions can be computed via the ordinary density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm despite having a non-Hermitian rate operator with a small spectral gap, we illustrate how that steady-state distribution can be efficiently projected to an order parameter that identifies bimodality, and we employ excited-state DMRG to calculate a relaxation timescale for the bistability.</p></details> |  |

This formalism allows to use tensor network methods for fermionic lattice systems in a local way, avoiding the need of a Jordan-Wigner transformation or the explicit tracking of leg crossings by swap gates in 2D tensor networks. The graded Hilbert spaces can be readily integrated with other internal and lattice symmetries in tensor networks, and only require minor extensions to an existing tensor network software package. We review and benchmark the fermionic versions of common algorithms for matrix product states and projected entangled-pair states.</p></details> | 78 pages, 6 figures |

As we have recently demonstrated in the context of quantum many-body physics, computation costs can be further substantially reduced by imposing constraints on the canonical polyadic (CP) rank of the tensors in such networks [arXiv:2205.15296]. Here, we demonstrate how tree tensor networks (TTN) with CP rank constraints and tensor dropout can be used in machine learning. The approach is found to outperform other tensor-network-based methods in Fashion-MNIST image classification. A low-rank TTN classifier with branching ratio $b=4$ reaches a test set accuracy of 90.3\% with low computation costs. Consisting of mostly linear elements, tensor network classifiers avoid the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. The CP rank constraints have additional advantages: The number of parameters can be decreased and tuned more freely to control overfitting, improve generalization properties, and reduce computation costs. They allow us to employ trees with large branching ratios, substantially improving the representation power.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures; published version</p></details> |
| **[The resource theory of tensor networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07394v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide succinct representations of quantum many-body states and are an important computational tool for strongly correlated quantum systems. Their expressive and computational power is characterized by an underlying entanglement structure, on a lattice or more generally a (hyper)graph, with virtual entangled pairs or multipartite entangled states associated to (hyper)edges. Changing this underlying entanglement structure into another can lead to both theoretical and computational benefits. We study a natural resource theory which generalizes the notion of bond dimension to entanglement structures using multipartite entanglement. It is a direct extension of resource theories of tensors studied in the context of multipartite entanglement and algebraic complexity theory, allowing for the application of the sophisticated methods developed in these fields to tensor networks. The resource theory of tensor networks concerns both the local entanglement structure of a quantum many-body state and the (algebraic) complexity of tensor network contractions using this entanglement structure. We show that there are transformations between entanglement structures which go beyond edge-by-edge conversions, highlighting efficiency gains of our resource theory that mirror those obtained in the search for better matrix multiplication algorithms. We also provide obstructions to the existence of such transformations by extending a variety of methods originally developed in algebraic complexity theory for obtaining complexity lower bounds. The resource theory of tensor networks allows to compare different entanglement structures and should lead to more efficient tensor network representations and contraction algorithms.</p></details> | 66 pages |

One-dimensional tensor networks -- often referred to as tensor trains (TT) or matrix product states (MPS) -- are increasingly being used as a numerical ansatz for continuum functions by "quantizing" the inputs into discrete binary digits. Here we demonstrate the power of more general tree tensor networks for this purpose. We provide direct constructions of a number of elementary functions as generic tree tensor networks and interpolative constructions for more complicated functions via a generalization of the tensor cross interpolation algorithm. For a range of multi-dimensional functions we show how more structured tree tensor networks offer a significantly more efficient ansatz than the commonly used tensor train. We demonstrate an application of our methods to solving multi-dimensional, non-linear Fredholm equations, providing a rigorous bound on the rank of the solution which, in turn, guarantees exponentially scaling accuracy with the size of the tree tensor network for certain problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 11 Pages and 6 Figures</p></details> |

Furthermore, we show that scan-DMRG successfully captures the universal critical scaling when applied across the magnetic Wess-Zumino-Witten and non-magnetic Ising transitions in the frustrated Haldane chain. In addition, we report a universal scaling of the lowest excitation energy as a function of a gradient rate. Finally, we argue that the scan-DMRG approach has significantly lower computational cost compare to the conventional DMRG protocols to study quantum phase transitions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that integrates these two methods, inheriting their distinct features in efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states and overcoming their limitations. We first introduce non-stoquasticity indicators (NSIs) and their upper bounds, which measure the sign problem, the most notable limitation of QMC. We show that our algorithm could greatly mitigate the sign problem, which decreases NSIs with the assistance of quantum computing. Meanwhile, the use of quantum Monte Carlo also increases the expressivity of shallow quantum circuits, allowing more accurate computation that is conventionally achievable only with much deeper circuits. We numerically test and verify the method for the N$_2$ molecule (12 qubits) and the Hubbard model (16 qubits). Our work paves the way to solving practical problems with intermediate-scale and early-fault tolerant quantum computers, with potential applications in chemistry, condensed matter physics, materials, high energy physics, etc.</p></details> |  |

Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating non-linear functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al. (2021). The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors. A key innovation of our approach is a new sequence of multilevel Monte Carlo approximations specifically designed for quantum computing, which is central to the algorithm's improved performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages; v2: improved writing, changed title, and added lower bound</p></details> |

However, the explicit form of the underlying Fokker-Planck equation governing the walker population distribution has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation for AFQMC and propose a novel numerical scheme to solve it. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation reveals the wavefunction actually sampled by the AFQMC algorithm. Interestingly, we find that even when the exact ground state is used as a guiding wavefunction in constrained path AFQMC, contrary to the common assumption, the wavefunction sampled by AFQMC is not exact. Beyond clarifying several fundamental aspects of AFQMC, the availability of a Fokker-Planck equation formulation opens new avenues for systematically improving its accuracy, which we outline in this paper.</p></details> |  |

NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ansätze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recently it has been shown (Xiao et al, arXiv2505.18519) that a broad class of highly correlated wave-functions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we apply this approach and present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.</p></details> |  |

| **[Quantum-assisted variational Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20799v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Recent advancements in quantum hardware have opened new avenues for addressing this challenge. Inspired by the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) algorithm [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], which was originally designed for sampling the Boltzmann distribution of classical spin models using quantum computers, we introduce a quantum-assisted variational Monte Carlo (QA-VMC) algorithm for solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems by adapting QeMCMC to sample the distribution of a (neural-network) wave function in VMC. The central question is whether such quantum-assisted proposal can potentially offer a computational advantage over classical methods. Through numerical investigations for the Fermi-Hubbard model and molecular systems, we demonstrate that the quantum-assisted proposal exhibits larger absolute spectral gaps and reduced autocorrelation times compared to conventional classical proposals, leading to more efficient sampling and faster convergence to the ground state in VMC as well as more accurate and precise estimation of physical observables. This advantage is especially pronounced for specific parameter ranges, where the ground-state configurations are more concentrated in some configurations separated by large Hamming distances. Our results underscore the potential of quantum-assisted algorithms to enhance classical variational methods for solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems.</p></details> | 37 pages, 11 figures |

However, inchworm Monte Carlo is computationally expensive, converging as $1/\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of samples. We show that the imaginary time integration is amenable to quasi Monte Carlo, with enhanced $1/N$ convergence, by mapping the Sobol low-discrepancy sequence from the hypercube to the simplex with the so-called Root transform. This extends the applicability of the inchworm method to, e.g., multi-orbital Anderson impurity models with off-diagonal hybridization, relevant for materials simulation, where continuous time hybridization expansion Monte Carlo has a severe sign problem.</p></details> |  |

In a growing number of domains, the design of algorithms is progressively shifting towards the field of quantum computing, where theoretical speedups over their classical counterparts are expected. In some of these domains, Monte Carlo methods have already been converted to a quantum computing friendly setup where the expected and observed gain in complexity is quadratic. Surprisingly, particle transport has been left aside along the path and lacks an implementation on these new architectures. In this work, a numerical scheme for particle transport based on discrete-time quantum walks and its combination with the amplitude amplification routine are proposed to catch up with the promised speedups.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we conduct a thorough analysis of all systematic errors arising in the formulation of quantum Monte Carlo integration in order to better understand the resources required to encode various distributions such as a Gaussian, and to evaluate statistical quantities such as the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of an asset. Finally, we study the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo integration for fundamental financial use cases in terms of simulation-based optimisations, notably Mean-Conditional-Value-at-Risk (Mean-CVaR) and (risky) Mean-Variance (Mean-Var) optimisation problems. In particular, we study the Mean-Var optimisation problem in the presence of noise on a quantum device, and benchmark a quantum error mitigation method that applies to quantum amplitude estimation -- a key subroutine of quantum Monte Carlo integration -- showcasing the utility of such an approach.</p></details> |  |

| **[Quantum Dynamical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01775v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the open challenges in quantum computing is to find meaningful and practical methods to leverage quantum computation to accelerate classical machine learning workflows. A ubiquitous problem in machine learning workflows is sampling from probability distributions that we only have access to via their log probability. To this end, we extend the well-known Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to leverage quantum computation in a hybrid manner as a proposal function. Our new algorithm, Quantum Dynamical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QD-HMC), replaces the classical symplectic integration proposal step with simulations of quantum-coherent continuous-space dynamics on digital or analogue quantum computers. We show that QD-HMC maintains key characteristics of HMC, such as maintaining the detailed balanced condition with momentum inversion, while also having the potential for polynomial speedups over its classical counterpart in certain scenarios. As sampling is a core subroutine in many forms of probabilistic inference, and MCMC in continuously-parameterized spaces covers a large-class of potential applications, this work widens the areas of applicability of quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 + 4...</summary><p>6 + 4 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Floating block method for quantum Monte Carlo simulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11439v2)** | 2023-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Monte Carlo simulations are powerful and versatile tools for the quantum many-body problem. In addition to the usual calculations of energies and eigenstate observables, quantum Monte Carlo simulations can in principle be used to build fast and accurate many-body emulators using eigenvector continuation or design time-dependent Hamiltonians for adiabatic quantum computing. These new applications require something that is missing from the published literature, an efficient quantum Monte Carlo scheme for computing the inner product of ground state eigenvectors corresponding to different Hamiltonians. In this work, we introduce an algorithm called the floating block method, which solves the problem by performing Euclidean time evolution with two different Hamiltonians and interleaving the corresponding time blocks. We use the floating block method and nuclear lattice simulations to build eigenvector continuation emulators for energies of $^4$He, $^8$Be, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O nuclei over a range of local and non-local interaction couplings. From the emulator data, we identify the quantum phase transition line from a Bose gas of alpha particles to a nuclear liquid.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures + 4 pages, 1 figure (supplemental materials).

| **[Sign Problem in Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08777v2)** | 2023-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation appears to be an extremely hard yet interesting problem. In this article, we present a pedagogical overview on the origin of the sign problem in various quantum Monte Carlo simulation techniques, ranging from the world-line and stochastic series expansion Monte Carlo for boson and spin systems to the determinant and momentum-space quantum Monte Carlo for interacting fermions. We point out the basis dependency of the sign problem and summarize the progresses to cure, ease and even make use of the sign problem over the years, such as symmetry analysis of the underlying Hamiltonian, basis optimization in writting down the partition functions and many others. Moreover, we state that although traditional lore saying that in case of sign problem, the average sign in QMC simulation approaches zero exponentially fast with the space-time volume of the configurational space, there are recent breakthroughs showing this is not always the case and based on the properties of the partition function for finite size systems, one could distinguish when the average sign has the usual exponential scaling and when it is bestowed with an algebraic scaling at the low temperature limit. Fermionic QMC simulations with such algebraic sign problems have been successfully carried out for extended Hubbard-type and quantum Moiré lattice models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Book ...</summary><p>Book chapter for Elsevier Encyclopedia of Condensed Matter Physics.

| **[Clock Factorized Quantum Monte Carlo Method for Long-range Interacting Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14082v3)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating long-range interacting systems is a challenging task due to its computational complexity that the computational effort for each local update is of order $\cal{O}$$(N)$, where $N$ is the size of system. Recently, a technique, called hereby the clock factorized quantum Monte Carlo method, was developed on the basis of the so-called factorized Metropolis filter [Phys. Rev. E 99 010105 (2019)]. In this work, we first explain step by step how the clock factorized quantum Monte Carlo method is implemented to reduce the computational overhead from $\cal{O}$$(N)$ to $\cal{O}$(1). In particular, the core ingredients, including the concepts of bound probabilities and bound rejection events, the tree-like data structure, and the fast algorithms for sampling an extensive set of discrete and small probabilities, are elaborated. Next, we show how the clock factorized quantum Monte Carlo method can be flexibly implemented in various update strategies, like the Metropolis and worm-type algorithms, and can be generalized to simulate quantum systems. Finally, we demonstrate the high efficiency of the clock factorized quantum Monte Carlo algorithms in the examples of the quantum Ising model and the Bose-Hubbard model with long-range interactions and/or long-range hopping amplitudes. We expect that the clock factorized quantum Monte Carlo algorithms would find broad applications in statistical and condensed-matter physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-assisted Monte Carlo algorithms for fermions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14903v2)** | 2023-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing is a promising way to systematically solve the longstanding computational problem, the ground state of a many-body fermion system. Many efforts have been made to realise certain forms of quantum advantage in this problem, for instance, the development of variational quantum algorithms. A recent work by Huggins et al. reports a novel candidate, i.e. a quantum-classical hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm with a reduced bias in comparison to its fully-classical counterpart. In this paper, we propose a family of scalable quantum-assisted Monte Carlo algorithms where the quantum computer is used at its minimal cost and still can reduce the bias. By incorporating a Bayesian inference approach, we can achieve this quantum-facilitated bias reduction with a much smaller quantum-computing cost than taking empirical mean in amplitude estimation. Besides, we show that the hybrid Monte Carlo framework is a general way to suppress errors in the ground state obtained from classical algorithms. Our work provides a Monte Carlo toolkit for achieving quantum-enhanced calculation of fermion systems on near-term quantum devices.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we survey the literature for implementing Monte Carlo procedures using quantum circuits, focusing on the potential to obtain a quantum advantage in the computational speed of these procedures. We revisit the quantum algorithms that could replace classical Monte Carlo and then consider both the existing quantum algorithms and the potential quantum realizations that include adaptive enhancements as alternatives to the classical procedure.</p></details> |  |

Here we exploit recent advances in periodic electronic structure to show that, by leveraging transfer learning starting from lower tier electronic structure methods, one can obtain machine learned potential energy surfaces for liquid water from the higher tier AFQMC, CCSD, and CCSD(T) approaches using $\le$200 energies. By performing both classical and path integral molecular dynamics simulations on these machine learned potential energy surfaces we uncover the interplay of dynamical electron correlation and nuclear quantum effects across the entire liquid range of water while providing a general strategy for efficiently utilizing periodic correlated electronic structure methods to explore disordered condensed phase systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Adversarial Learning in Emulation of Monte-Carlo Methods for Max-cut Approximation: QAOA is not optimal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13767v1)** | 2022-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the leading candidates for near-term quantum advantage is the class of Variational Quantum Algorithms, but these algorithms suffer from classical difficulty in optimizing the variational parameters as the number of parameters increases. Therefore, it is important to understand the expressibility and power of various ansätze to produce target states and distributions. To this end, we apply notions of emulation to Variational Quantum Annealing and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to show that QAOA is outperformed by variational annealing schedules with equivalent numbers of parameters. Our Variational Quantum Annealing schedule is based on a novel polynomial parameterization that can be optimized in a similar gradient-free way as QAOA, using the same physical ingredients. In order to compare the performance of ansätze types, we have developed statistical notions of Monte-Carlo methods. Monte-Carlo methods are computer programs that generate random variables that approximate a target number that is computationally hard to calculate exactly. While the most well-known Monte-Carlo method is Monte-Carlo integration (e.g. Diffusion Monte-Carlo or path-integral quantum Monte-Carlo), QAOA is itself a Monte-Carlo method that finds good solutions to NP-complete problems such as Max-cut. We apply these statistical Monte-Carlo notions to further elucidate the theoretical framework around these quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Unified Categorical Description of Quantum Hall Hierarchy and Anyon Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03848v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified category-theoretic framework for quantum Hall hierarchy constructions and anyon superconductivity based on modular tensor categories over $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{U}(1))$ and $\mathrm{sRep}(\mathrm{U}(1)^f)$. Our approach explicitly incorporates conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge and formulates doping via a generalized stack-and-condense procedure, in which an auxiliary topological order is stacked onto the parent phase, and the quasiparticles created by doping subsequently condense. Depending on whether this condensation preserves or breaks the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry, the system undergoes a transition to a quantum Hall hierarchy state or to an anyon superconductor. For anyon superconductors, the condensate charge is determined unambiguously by the charged local bosons contained in the condensable algebra. Our framework reproduces all known anyon superconductors obtained from field-theoretic analyses and further predicts novel phases, including a charge-$2e$ anyon superconductor derived from the Laughlin state and charge-$ke$ anyon superconductors arising from bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_k$ Read-Rezayi states. By placing hierarchy transitions and anyon superconductivity within a single mathematical formalism, our work provides a unified understanding of competing and proximate phases near experimentally realizable fractional quantum Hall states.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Unconventional superconductivity from lattice quantum disorder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03576v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unconventional superconductivity presents a defining and enduring challenge in condensed matter physics. Prevailing theoretical frameworks have predominantly emphasized electronic degrees of freedom, largely neglecting the rich physics inherent in the lattice. Although conventional phonon theory offers an elegant description of structural phase diagrams and lattice dynamics, its omission of nuclear quantum many-body effects results in misleading phase diagram interpretations and, consequently, an unsound foundation for superconducting theory. Here, by incorporating nuclear quantum many-body effects within first-principles calculations, we discover a lattice quantum disordered phase in superconductors H3S and La3Ni2O7. This phase occupies a triangular region in the pressure-temperature phase diagram, whose left boundary aligns precisely with Tc of the left flank of the superconducting dome. The Tcmax of this quantum disordered phase coincides with the maximum of superconducting Tc, indicating this phase as both the origin of superconductivity on the dome's left flank and a key ingredient of its pairing mechanism. Our findings advance the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity and establish the lattice quantum disordered phase as a unifying framework, both for predicting new superconductors and for elucidating phenomena in a broader context of condensed matter physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design of a 60.8 K superconducting hydride LiMgZr2H12 at ambient pressure via Lithium doping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03471v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-pressure hydrogen-rich compounds have long been regarded as promising room-temperature superconductor candidates; however, their practical applications are limited by their reliance on extreme compression. This study explores hydrogen-rich superconductors that may be stable at ambient pressures. Inspired by recent investigations of the MgZrH2n family, the LiMgZr2H12 structure with a Pmmm symmetry was constructed, and its thermodynamic, mechanical, and dynamical stability were evaluated using first-principles calculations. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) analysis suggests that LiMgZr2H12 reaches a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 60.8 K at ambient pressure. Compared with MgZrH6, Li doping significantly increases the contribution of hydrogen atoms to the electron density of states near the Fermi level (EF) and enhances the EPC constant of the LiMgZr2H12 structure. LiMgZr2H12 exhibits a superconducting figure of merit of 1.56, which is significantly greater than that of MgZrH6, demonstrating its outstanding potential for practical applications. This work guides ambient-pressure design of high-Tc hydrides.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tunable, Modeless, and Hybridization-free Cross-Kerr Coupler for Miniaturized Superconducting Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03186v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting quantum circuits typically use capacitive charge-based linear coupling schemes to control interactions between elements such as qubits. While simple and effective, this coupling scheme makes it difficult to satisfy competing circuit design requirements such as maintaining large qubit anharmonicity and coherence along with a high degree of qubit connectivity and packing density. Moreover, tunable interactions using linear coupling elements produce dynamical variations in mode hybridization, which can induce non-adiabatic transitions, resulting in leakage errors and limiting gate speeds. In this work we attempt to address these challenges by proposing a junction-based coupling architecture based on SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) couplers with relatively small Josephson energies. SQUID couplers provide intrinsic cross-Kerr interactions that can be controlled by external fluxes and that do not rely on mode hybridization. The small Josephson energies of the coupler maintain the interaction at a perturbative scale, which limits undesired higher-order mixing between coupled elements while achieving a sufficiently strong cross-Kerr interaction originating from diagonal coupling elements. Based on these properties, we show that a SQUID coupler can be used to implement a fast, adiabatic, and high-fidelity controlled-Z gate without introducing extra modes, and the operation is robust against junction asymmetry for high-frequency qubits. Although unconventional crosstalk may arise due to junction asymmetries and parasitic hybridization with spectator qubits, we show that these effects are sufficiently small for realistic circuit parameters. As an example of the utility of such junction-based coupling schemes, we present a scalable tiling strategy for a miniaturized superconducting quantum processor based on merged-element transmon qubits.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Tuning current flow in superconducting thin film strips by control wires. Applications to single photon detectors and diodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02984v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is shown that integration of a thin film superconducting strip with current-carrying control wires enables one to engineer a profile of supercurrent density $J(x)$ with no current crowding at the edges of a strip wider than the magnetic Pearl length $Λ$. Moreover, $J(x)$ in a strip can be tuned by control wires to produce an inverted $J(x)$ profile with dips at the edges to mitigate current crowding at lithographic defects and block premature penetration of vortices. These conclusions are corroborated by calculations of $J(x)$ in a thin strip coupled inductively with side control wires or in bilayer strip structures by solving the London and Ginzburg Landau equations in the thin film Pearl limit. Thermally-activated penetration of vortices from the edges and unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs in inverted $J(x)$ profiles are evaluated. It is shown that these structures can be used to develop single-photon strip detectors much wider than $Λ$. Such detectors can be tuned {\it in situ} by varying current in control wires to reach the ultimate photon sensitivity limited by unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs. The structures considered here also exhibit a non-reciprocal current response and behave as superconducting diodes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fractal Topology of Majorana Bound States in Superconducting Quasicrystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02796v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasicrystalline order induces a fractal energy spectrum, yet its impact on topological protection remains an open fundamental question. Here, we demonstrate that the topological phase transitions characterised by the appearance of Majorana Bound States themselves have a fractal character. By extending this analysis to the full family of Sturmian words, we uncover Kitaev's Butterfly $-$ a spectral fractal analogous to Hofstadter's butterfly, but fundamentally distinguished by a central superconducting gap. Within this framework, we identify Majorana's Butterfly as a fractal topological phase diagram governed by the competition between quasicrystallinity and superconducting pairing. We show that this competition dictates a hierarchy of Majorana stability, where the survival of the topological phase against fractal fragmentation is determined by the relative strength of these competing energy scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visualizing the Odd-parity Superconducting Order Parameter and its Quasiparticle Surface Band in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02490v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A distinctive identifier of nodal intrinsic topological superconductivity (ITS) would the appearance of an Andreev bound state on crystal surfaces parallel to the nodal axis, in the form of a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) appearing only for $T < T_C$. Moreover, theory shows that specific QSB characteristics observable in tunneling to an s-wave superconductor can distinguish between chiral and non-chiral ITS order parameter $Δ_k$. To search for such phenomena in $\text{UTe}_2$, s-wave superconductive scan-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging was employed. It reveals an intense zero-energy Andreev conductance maximum at the $\text{UTe}_2$ (0-11) crystal termination. Development of the zero-energy Andreev conductance peak into two finite-energy particle-hole symmetric conductance maxima as the tunnel barrier is reduced, then signifies that $\text{UTe}_2$ superconductivity is non-chiral. Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) for an ITS material should be dominated by the QSB for energies within the superconductive energy gap $|E| \le Δ$, so that bulk $Δ(k)$ characteristics of the ITS can only be detected excursively. Again using a superconducting scan-tip, the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of the QSB of $\text{UTe}_2$ were visualized. Specifically, a band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears as a characteristic sextet $q_i$ :$i = 1-6$ of interference wavevectors showing that QSB dispersions $k(E)$ occur only for energies $|E| \le Δ_{max}$ and only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. In combination, these phenomena are consistent with a bulk $Δ(k)$ exhibiting spin triplet, time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, $B_{3u}$ symmetry in $\text{UTe}_2$.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Topological superconducting phase in a non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with staggered pairing imbalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02059v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with staggered imbalance in the $p$-wave superconducting pairing. By tuning the chemical potential and the pairing imbalance, we find that the eigenenergy spectrum undergoes real-to-complex transitions, and the spectral gap can change from a real to an imaginary line gap. The pairing imbalance significantly enlarges the parameter region supporting a topological superconducting phase. Remarkably, we show that a topologically nontrivial phase hosting Majorana zero modes can be induced by varying the pairing imbalance, even in the regime of strong chemical potential. The gap-closing points and phase boundaries are determined analytically, and the resulting phase diagrams are characterized by a nonzero topological invariant. Furthermore, we identify the existence of Majorana zero modes and finite-energy Majorana edge modes in this system. Our results reveal exotic phenomena arising from imbalanced pairing and establish a new platform for exploring topological superconductivity in non-Hermitian systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Real-time detection of correlated quasiparticle tunneling events in a multi-qubit superconducting device](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01945v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasiparticle tunneling events are a source of decoherence and correlated errors in superconducting circuits. Understanding and ultimately mitigating these errors calls for real-time detection of quasiparticle tunneling events on individual devices. In this work, we simultaneously detect quasiparticle tunneling events in two co-housed, charge-sensitive transmons coupled to a common waveguide. We measure background quasiparticle tunneling rates at the single-hertz level, with temporal resolution of tens of microseconds. Using time-tagged coincidence analysis, we show that individual events are uncorrelated across devices, whereas burst episodes occur about once per minute and are largely correlated. These bursts have a characteristic lifetime of 7 ms and induce a thousand-fold increase in the quasiparticle tunneling rate across both devices. In addition, we identify a rarer subset of bursts which are accompanied by a shift in the offset charge, at approximately one event per hour. Our results establish a practical and extensible method to identify quasiparticle bursts in superconducting circuits, as well as their correlations and spatial structure, advancing routes to suppress correlated errors in superconducting quantum processors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10358v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order Van Hove singularities in strongly correlated electron systems provide a fertile ground for emergent electronic orders and superconductivity. This study investigates the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities on the honeycomb lattice, a paradigmatic platform relevant to graphene. By incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \(t''\), we uncover a universal crossover: ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate below the higher-order Van Hove filling, while antiferromagnetic fluctuations take over toward half filling. A key finding is that the already dominant \(f_n\)-wave pairing is enhanced in the critical region of this magnetic crossover by the higher-order Van Hove. This enhancement is driven by the synergistic effect of the higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states and the competing magnetic fluctuations. Although increased hopping parameters generally suppress superconducting correlation, we identify a critical \(t''\) that anomalously enhances pairing via the higher-order Van Hove renormalization. Furthermore, the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction suppresses the pairing correlation function in a sign-independent manner. Our results clarify the competitive mechanisms between magnetic fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity in higher-order Van Hove singularities systems, offering a theoretical basis for tailoring quantum phases in graphene-based materials via band engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication as a Regular Article in Physical Review B</p></details> |
| **[Josephson wormhole in coupled superconducting Yukawa-SYK metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16907v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures. v2: outlook section added, published version</p></details> |
| **[Ferroelectric quantum critical point in superconducting hydrides: The case of H$_3$S](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00833v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>H$_3$S sulfur hydride has been widely investigated for its high superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 203 K at about $p_c = 155$ GPa. Despite being the precursor of superconducting hydrides, a detailed picture of its phase diagram in an extended temperature and pressure range is still missing. To determine it with inclusion of both thermal and quantum effects, we carry out path integral molecular dynamics combined to a MACE neural network potential trained on BLYP density functional theory configurations. The resulting H$_3$S phase diagram is characterized by the ferroelectric transition between the Im$\bar{3}$m and R3m phases, which originates from a quantum critical point (QCP) located at $p_\mathrm{QCP} \approx 134$ GPa. We show that the experimental $T_c$ peak falls into a paraelectric region of large nuclear quantum fluctuations above the ferroelectric QCP, as measured by local phonon Green's functions resolved in imaginary time, where fluctuating dipole moments are at play. We study the critical behavior of the system in the proximity of the QCP by a finite-size scaling analysis, showing that it belongs to the 4D Ising universality class. We finally discuss its implications for the superconducting state.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, Supplementary Material appended</p></details> |
| **[Single-site dissipation stabilizes a superconducting nonequilibrium steady state in a strongly correlated lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00452v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can superconducting order be made a robust attractor of open-system dynamics in strongly correlated lattices? We demonstrate that it can by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle--hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, a locally transformed $η$-pair lowering operator, on as little as a single lattice site, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) with macroscopic $η$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $η$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. Our results establish a disorder-tolerant route to stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor via minimal local quantum-jump control.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Understanding multiscale disorder in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23277v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are central to applications across quantum information science. Yet, their performance is limited by the effects of disorder and electrodynamic inhomogeneities that are not well understood. By combining DC transport, dark-count measurements, and bias-dependent microwave transmission spectroscopy in the presence of controlled nanoscale disorder introduced through helium-ion irradiation, we distinguish local instability-driven processes from intrinsic superconducting depairing and kinetic inductance nonlinearities. This approach enables systematic tuning of kinetic inductance, depairing currents, microwave dissipation, and mode structure within a single device. Bias- and temperature-dependent resonance shifts quantify disorder-induced modifications of the superconducting density of states through the nonlinear kinetic inductance, while the emergence of multiple resonant modes reveals the formation of electrodynamically distinct superconducting regions. Comparing depairing under current, field, and temperature isolates the dominant microwave loss mechanisms, separating vortex, quasiparticle, and two-level-system contributions, thus providing a robust multifunctional foundation for disorder engineering of superconducting nanowire detectors and resonators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory in Superconducting Circuits with Infinite-Dimensional Local Hilbert Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23150v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a superconducting-circuit architecture that realizes a compact U(1) lattice gauge theory using the intrinsic infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of phase and charge variables. The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime. The required circuit parameters are within the current experimental capabilities. Our results establish superconducting circuits as a scalable, continuous-variable platform for analog quantum simulation of non-perturbative gauge dynamics.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Andreev bound states in a superconducting qubit at odd parity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23100v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum mechanics of the Josephson effect is the core ingredient for quantum technologies with superconducting circuits. A new avenue was recently opened in this field by predicting that the Josephson quantum mechanics in the odd parity sector, when a quasiparticle in trapped in an Andreev bound state, is fundamentally different from the conventional one in the even sector. The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment. Here we consider the distinct case of a superconducting qubit made of a single Josephson junction whose environment reduces to a capacitance. We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime. Our prediction could be tested in forthcoming experiments with superconductor/semiconductor/superconductor junctions, which have been studied intensively in recent years, both using nanowires as well as two-dimensional electron gases.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01759v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we develop an effective theory and propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. This sliding mechanism breaks the $\mathcal{M}_{z}\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Magnetic texture modulated superconductivity in superconductor/ferromagnet shells of semiconductor nanowires](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22051v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a one-dimensional ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, magnetism can suppress superconductivity except where the Zeeman field is suppressed, for example domain wall superconductivity (DWS) near magnetic domain walls or multi-domain-averaged superconductivity (MDAS) in multi-domain states where the net magnetization over the coherence length averages to nearly zero. Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\approx$5.5 $μ$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting properties of transition metal dichalcogenides in proximity to a conventional superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21994v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold relevance for spin-triplet superconducting phases due to their inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling, but the majority of studies have so far focused on oversimplified models. In this work, we consider a TMD monolayer using a three-orbital model with anisotropic couplings and investigate the emergent superconducting properties when it is placed in proximity to a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the multiorbital nature of the TMDs lead to superconducting gaps not only at zero energy, but also at higher energies, so-called hybridization gaps, which exhibit a complex structure due to the anisotropic couplings, challenging their spectral measurement. Moreover, we find that the inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling induces a spin splitting and a spin polarization along the $z$-direction, which correlates with the emergence of mixed spin-triplet superconducting pairs. These spin-triplet pair correlations appear in the monolayer as a proximity-induced effect due to the impact of the Ising spin-orbit field on conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity. Taking realistic parameters for a $\text{MoS}_2$ monolayer, we show that the Ising field is strong enough to induce spin-triplet pair correlations of the same magnitude as their spin-singlet counterparts. We also include Rashba spin-orbit coupling, naturally emerging in a heterostructure and find that it induces equal spin-triplet superconducting pairs that compete with the mixed spin-triplet pairs induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our findings help understand the superconducting properties of TMDs in proximity to conventional superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Collapse of the superconducting order parameter in Ising superconductors with Rashba spin-orbit coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01910v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ising superconductors have attracted quite some attention recently, due to their resilience against magnetic fields way beyond the Pauli-paramagnetic limit. Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Spin and Charge Conductivity in the Square Lattice Fermi-Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03771v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical properties are notoriously difficult to compute in numerical treatments of the Fermi-Hubbard model, especially in two spatial dimensions. However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region. Our method helps paint a more complete picture of the conductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and opens the door to studying dynamical properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Resolving Quantum Criticality in the Honeycomb Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03656v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between Dirac fermions and electronic correlations on the honeycomb lattice hosts a fundamental quantum phase transition from a semimetal to a Mott insulator, governed by the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg (GNH) universality class. Despite its importance, consensus on the precise critical exponents remains elusive due to severe finite-size effects in numerical simulations and the lack of conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model, including the first QMC determination of the fermion anomalous dimension, show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+20...</summary><p>12+20 pages, 6+16 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dynamical witnesses and universal behavior across chaos and non-ergodicity in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00369v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum chaos in isolated quantum systems is intimately linked to thermalization and the rapid relaxation of observables. Although the spectral properties of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model have been well characterized, the corresponding dynamical signatures across the transition to regularity remain less explored . In this work, we investigate this transition by analyzing the time evolution of the survival probability, the single-site entanglement entropy, and the half-chain imbalance. Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figure |
| **[Analysis of self-thermalization dynamics in the Bose-Hubbard model by using the pseudoclassical approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22553v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the self-thermalization dynamics of the $M$-site Bose-Hubbard model in terms of the single-particle density matrix that is calculated by using the pseudoclassical approach. It is shown that a weak inter-particle interaction, which suffices to convert the integrable system of non-interacting bosons into a chaotic system, has a negligible effect on the thermal density matrix given by the Bose-Einstein distribution. This opens the door for equilibration where the two coupled Bose-Hubbard systems, which are initially in different thermal states, relax to the same thermal state. When we couple these two subsystems by using a lattice of the length $L\ll M$, we numerically calculate the quasi-stationary current of Bose particles across the lattice and show that its magnitude is consistent with the solution of the master equation for the boundary driven $L$-site Bose-Hubbard model.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Emergent Spatial Textures from Interaction Quenches in the Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22053v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction quenches in strongly correlated electron systems provide a powerful route to probe nonequilibrium many-body dynamics. For the Hubbard model, nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory has revealed coherent post-quench oscillations, dynamical crossovers, and long-lived transient regimes. However, these studies are largely restricted to spatially homogeneous dynamics and therefore neglect the role of spatial structure formation during ultrafast evolution. Here we investigate interaction quenches in the half-filled Hubbard model using a real-space time-dependent Gutzwiller framework. We show that homogeneous nonequilibrium dynamics is generically unstable: even arbitrarily weak spatial fluctuations grow dynamically and drive the system toward intrinsically inhomogeneous states. Depending on the interaction strength, the post-quench evolution exhibits spatial differentiation, nucleation, and slow coarsening of Mott-like domains. Our results establish spatial self-organization as a generic feature of far-from-equilibrium correlated matter and reveal a fundamental limitation of spatially homogeneous nonequilibrium theories.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5+4 Figures |

By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity. Notably, we propose a unified framework linking disorder-driven localization to deterministic phase frustration, identifying the Bubble Phase as a pristine, disorder-free archetype of the Bose glass. Our results provide a theoretical blueprint for realizing glassy dynamics in clean quantum simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21056v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems. Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.</p></details> |  |

While dimer-monomer bound states are manifested as a single particle attached to dimer bound pair, it is still unclear about quantum walks and Bloch oscillations of dimer-monomer bound states. Here, we revisit three-particle bound states in the Bose-Hubbard model and find that interaction-induced impurities adjacent to bound pair and boundaries cause two kinds of bound states: one is dimer-monomer bound state and the other is bound edge states. In quantum walks, the spread velocity of dimer-monomer bound state is determined by the maximal group velocity of their energy band, which is much smaller than that in the single-particle case. In Bloch oscillations, the period of dimer-monomer bound states is one third of that in the single-particle case. Our works provide new insights to the collective dynamics of three-particle bound states.</p></details> |  |

Floquet engineering, the coherent dressing of quantum states with periodic non-resonant optical fields, has become an important strategy for quantum control. Most applications to solid-state systems have targeted weakly interacting or single-ion states, leaving the manipulation of many-body wavefunctions largely unexplored. Here, we use Floquet engineering to achieve quantum control of a strongly correlated Hubbard exciton in the one-dimensional Mott insulator Sr$_2$CuO$_3$. A nonresonant midinfrared optical field coherently dresses the exciton wavefunction, driving its rotation between bright and dark states. We use resonant third-harmonic generation to quantify ultrafast $π/2$ rotations on the Bloch sphere spanned by these exciton states. Our work advances the quest towards programmable control of correlated states and exciton-based quantum sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>main+...</summary><p>main+supplementary, 43 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moiré systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moiré potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moiré potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moiré potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moiré systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |

A graphical representation of the chemical potential equation is first obtained. The correlation function, which describes the transitions of π-electrons from one fullerene site to the nearest site, and the thermodynamic average, which characterizes the probability of detecting two π-electrons with oppositely oriented spin projections on a single fullerene site, are then calculated. The theoretically obtained values for the ionization energy of 7.57 eV and the electron affinity of 2.67 eV coincide with the experimentally observed values and demonstrate that, during photoionization or another process leading to either the acquisition or loss of a π-electron, the fullerene responds to external perturbations as a single system of strongly correlated π-electrons.</p></details> | 7 |

We propose an altermagnetic (AM) order in a repulsive Hubbard model on the Lieb-$5$ lattice. Considering only nearest-neighbor hoppings within the lattice, we show a phase transition from the nonmagnetic to a unique AM isolated band metal phase (AMIM), allowing clear identification of spin-split states. Additionally, the AM metallic phase (AMM) is also shown to appear as an intermediate phase during the transition from the normal metal to the AMIM in the presence of the diagonal hopping within each unit cell of the Lieb-$5$ lattice. The manifestation of distinct AM phases and the phase transitions, driven by Hubbard interaction and hopping integrals, have been explored in terms of spin-resolved band structure, spectral function, and the behavior of the AM order parameter. The stability of these AM phases against the spin-orbit coupling and temperature is also established.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+5 p...</summary><p>9+5 pages; 5+8 figures; Comments are welcome</p></details> |

While the magnetic responses on the ordered phases can be mundane, the orbital magnetic flux and the Zeeman coupling have synergetic effects on the internal gauge flux generations in the relevant spin liquid phases. The former was known to induce an internal U(1) gauge flux indirectly through the charge fluctuations and ring exchange, and thus could lead to the formation of a chiral spin liquid. The latter could spontaneously generate a uniform field-dependent internal gauge flux, driving a conically-ordered state. The competition and interplay between these two field effects are discussed through a generic spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model and with the experimental consequences. Our results could find applications in the moiré superlattice systems with the Hofstadter-Hubbard model as well as the triangular lattice antiferromagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |

Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, in particular, remains in need of definitive study within fundamental electronic models. Here we employ state-of-the-art finite-temperature and ground-state tensor network approaches to systematically explore the superconducting (SC) phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model subjected to Zeeman fields. We find that zero-momentum $d$-wave superconductivity persists until the spin gap closes, coexisting with charge density waves. A novel $d$-wave FFLO phase emerges under a higher Zeeman field even above the Pauli limit, concomitant with a field-enhanced spin density waves. We identify these phases, characterized by the simultaneous presence of pairing condensate and density wave orders, as charge-2e supersolids. Analysis of Matsubara Green's function reveals that the FFLO pairing momentum is locked to the underlying Fermi surface. Our results provide microscopic insights into field-induced unconventional pairing mechanisms and reveal the long-sought FFLO state in a fundamental correlated electron model, offering a promising route for its realization in ultracold atom optical lattice.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages, 4+4 figures</p></details> |

In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints is BRST-exact in our theory. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor.

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity in a bilayer $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07545v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $δ= 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $δ= 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

Here, we employ micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ($μ$-ARPES) on single-domain Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ to disentangle the complex hierarchy of intrinsic and back-folded bands, explicitly identifying the electronic states driving the DW phase transition. We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $α$ and $β$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\sim44$ meV on the $α$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $β$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping. These results define a coherent microscopic fingerprint for the trilayer nickelates, identifying the specific nesting channels and correlation effects that underpin the phase diagram.</p></details> | 10 pages,5 figures |

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the superconducting state, it is essential to elucidate the nature of the DW order. In this study, we utilized $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) to investigate the charge density wave (CDW) and spin density wave (SDW) orders in both single-crystal and polycrystalline La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Near $T_{\rm{DW}} \approx 133$ K, an abrupt change in both the linewidth and frequency of the La(2) site in the single-crystal sample provides compelling evidence for a first-order-like phase transition. The pronounced broadening of the NQR lines indicates the incommensurate nature of the DW order. Furthermore, the spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature 1/$T_1$$T$ exhibits a strong enhancement at $T_{\rm{DW}}$, indicating the strong spin fluctuations above the first-order DW transition. These observations suggest an intricate interplay between incommensurate CDW and SDW orders. Our findings offer critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms of the DW state in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and establish an essential framework for exploring the interplay between DW and superconducting phases in nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have been found in this phase. At ambient pressure, La3Ni2O7-1313 has been reported to crystallize in three different space-group symmetries Cmmm, Imma, and Fmmm. Unlike the commonly observed tilted NiO6 octahedra in perovskite nickelates, the Cmmm phase exhibits no NiO6 tilts, implying that this structural feature alone may be insufficient to give rise to superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Here, we employ first-principles calculations and group theory analysis to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in this SL-TL La3Ni2O7 polymorph. At ambient pressure, we identify multiple unstable phonon branches in the highest symmetry (Cmmm) structure at various high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Distortions associated with these instabilities lead to one of the other experimentally reported space groups (Imma) that does display octahedral tilts. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7-1313 at ambient pressure is dominated by the TL block, as the SL is in a Mott-insulating regime. Under pressure, a tetragonal P4/mmm structure becomes stable, in agreement with experiments.</p></details> |  |

Establishing the diversity of ground states across different Ruddlesden-Popper phases is crucial for elucidating the superconducting mechanisms in these nickelates. Motivated by the recent report of superconductivity in hybrid 1212-type La5Ni3O11, we synthesized and investigated the long-range-ordered hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7. In contrast to its bilayer counterpart, the 1313-type La3Ni2O7 exhibits characteristic semiconducting behavior at ambient pressure, displaying a distinct anomaly at 170 K. This behavior is consistently evidenced by measurements of both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy unambiguously indicates a spin-density-wave transition occurring at 170 K. High-pressure electrical transport measurements demonstrate the induction of metallization under pressure, yet reveal no discernible traces of superconductivity up to 65 GPa. Our findings establish hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7 as a new member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family exhibiting a distinct spin-density-wave transition, and offers a new platform for investigating the interplay among crystal structure, electronic orders, and superconductivity in hybrid nickelates.</p></details> | 18 papers, 4 figures |

The realization of superconductivity in thin films requires delicate control of growth conditions, which presents significant challenges in the synthesis process. Furthermore, the stability of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$ films is compromised by oxygen loss, which complicates their characterization. We introduce an effective recycling protocol that involves oxygen removal in a precursor phase followed by ozone-assisted annealing, which restores superconducting properties. By tuning the oxygen content, we construct an electronic phase diagram that highlights oxygen addition as a potential analogue to hole doping via La substitution with Sr, providing insights into the doping mechanism and guiding future material optimization.</p></details> |  |

The low-energy electrodynamics is strongly anisotropic, with metallic in-plane and insulating out-of-plane character. In the ordered phase, the anisotropy grows more than an order of magnitude as the out-of-plane conductivity is sharply suppressed. We interpret this enhancement as an effective electronic decoupling of the Ni-O layers, driven by a spin-density-wave-induced redistribution of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ occupation within the trilayers. This electronic response is accompanied by clear shifts and splittings of the out-of-plane phonons, compatible with a density-wave instability of electronic origin.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 22 figures, main text and supplementary material</p></details> |

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($α,α^{\prime},β$) and two hole pockets ($γ,γ^{\prime}$), where the additional $α^{\prime}$ and $γ^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $γ$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the fate of the superconducting properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

While both nickelates exhibit density-wave (DW) transitions accompanied by the opening of a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck, their electronic responses display strikingly different symmetry properties. La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ maintains an isotropic optical response across the entire temperature range. In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K. The presence of macroscopic electronic anisotropy in the bilayer system, and its absence in the trilayer system, suggests an intimate relation between electronic nematic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ that worth for deeper explorations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% ($\sim$ 2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures.

Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\rm DW} \approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $ΔT_{SDW} \simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p></details> |  |

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\it within} the $γ$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Using fully self-consistent DFT+$U$ calculations on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures, we identify that intrinsic hole doping via interfacial Sr interdiffusion is the decisive factor in stabilizing the metallic state. Our 1-unit-cell model accurately reproduces the ARPES-observed Fermi surface, particularly the critical Ni-$d_{z^2}$ derived $γ$ hole pocket, which originates exclusively from the interface-proximal bilayer. Furthermore, comparative tight-binding analysis suggests that the reduced superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in thin films stems from the synergistic suppression of the electronic density of states (DOS) and vertical superexchange coupling ($J \perp Z$). These findings highlight that interface engineering plays a critical role beyond simple strain imposition in modulating nickelate orbital physics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional Hubbard model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p></details> |  |

We report that the heavy-Fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a fluctuation regime that extends over a temperature range as wide as $T_{\rm c}$ itself -- the largest observed for any three-dimensional superconductor. Through ultrasound measurements of the elastic moduli and sound attenuation, we find that UTe$_2$ transitions from a mean-field-like state at ambient pressure to a fluctuation dominated state at higher pressures. This regime is marked by elastic softening and an increase in sound attenuation that onsets well above $T_{\rm c}$, with the attenuation remaining anomalously high deep in the superconducting state. Our analysis shows that these features stem from an extremely low superfluid phase stiffness. This results in a kinetic inductance as high as that of granular aluminum, but achieved in the clean limit. We propose that this exotic state is driven by dominant inter-band pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, leading to "local" cooper pairs with a coherence length of only a few lattice constants.</p></details> | 7 figures |

Motivated by these experiments, we theoretically investigate the topological surface states on the (011) surface of UTe$_2$. We find that a two-dimensional nearly flat band emerges in the $B_{3u}$ state, giving rise to a pronounced zero-energy peak in the surface density of states. This flat band is supported by two key mechanisms: (i)~nontrivial Berry phases defined at multiple momenta give rise to low-energy in-gap states, and (ii)~weak spin conservation allows the gap function to acquire phase winding. Furthermore, to investigate the relation between the zero-bias peak observed in recent STM experiments with a superconducting tip and the topological surface states, we calculate the nonequilibrium dc tunneling current in a junction between an $s$-wave superconductor and the (011) surface of UTe$_2$. Our results provide crucial insights into the superconducting pairing symmetry realized in UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages |

At low temperatures, the specific heat exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field when the field is applied precisely along the $b$ axis, in stark contrast to its rapid increase at low fields for other orientations. This pronounced anisotropy suggests the presence of nodal quasiparticle excitations with the Fermi velocity predominantly aligned along the $b$ axis. Considering the characteristic field-angle dependences of both the specific heat and the upper critical field, these observations are broadly compatible with theoretical models that assume a superconducting gap structure featuring either point nodes consistent with $B_{\rm 2u}$ symmetry, allowed in the infinitely strong spin-orbit coupling scheme, or line nodes confined to flat regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, consistent with $^3B_{\rm 3u}$ symmetry in the finite spin-orbit classification scheme. These results yield crucial hints for resolving the pairing symmetry of UTe$_2$, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its spin-triplet superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in J.

Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, including 5 pages and 4 figures of Supplementary Material, accepted for publication in Phys.

The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle Δ_{z}\rangle/\langleΔ_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>21+14...</summary><p>21+14 pages, 5+9 figures, 1+1 tables</p></details> |

Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity are observed in the longitudinal elastic mode $c_{11}$ for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$ from $b$-axis. We confirm an upper critical field of $H_{\rm c2}\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and bulk superconductivity which survives up to $T\approx 2$ K for fields above the metamagnetic transition. The $c_{11}$ mode has propagation and displacement vectors along the $a$-axis, and for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$, this mode is sensitive to the elasticity of the vortex lattice. The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material included</p></details> |

Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures (including SI)</p></details> |

We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $μ_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted as regular article</p></details> |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

We show that the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit $H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to $\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry. It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.</p></details> | 41pages, 14figures |

In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $χ^b > χ^a > χ^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $χ^a > χ^c > χ^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |

This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nodal superconducting gap structure and topological surface states of UTe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11603v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($κ$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$κ$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $κ$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</p></details> | 21 pages. 17 figures |

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Collinear $p$-wave magnetism and hidden orbital ferrimagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07418v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, collinear magnets are classified as even-wave magnets, i.e., either ferro-, antiferro-, or altermagnets. It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets. Our work provides a new perspective on collinear magnets and the spin-space group classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[${\bf \frac{h}{e}}$ flux quantization in metals due to Berry phase coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12223v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Berry curvature does not show itself in the relative phase correlation of wave-functions at different spatial points in a metal unless the fermions have closed trajectories in momentum space, for example those around isolated impurities. But these, just as the Bloch phase correlations, disappear at lengths larger than the diffusion length. If a quasi-two dimensional metal with Berry curvature has a set of domains, their boundaries necessarily carry chiral currents precluding back-ward scattering. The Berry induced phase coherence then persists over length scales of order the scale at which the chiral one-dimensional states scatter into the bulk states, which can be macroscopic. The conditions for their occurrence and the lengths and the orientation of such states are derived. These calculations are used to understand the remarkable aspects of a recent experiment in an anisotropic metal, reported to have loop-current order, with mean-free path of about 0.01 $μ$m which exhibits flux quantization in some transport properties over lengths of several $μ$m. %It is also shown that generating the appropriately oriented channels in the plane by the field applied is plausible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982v4)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum XY model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two-dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moiré twisted bi-layer graphene and bilayer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear-in-temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those caused by Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature-independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln ω_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p></details> | 65 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Artificial electrostatic crystals: a new platform for creating correlated quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12769v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electronic properties of solids are determined by the crystal structure and interactions between electrons, giving rise to a variety of collective phenomena including superconductivity, strange metals and correlated insulators. The mechanisms underpinning many of these collective phenomena remain unknown, driving interest in creating artificial crystals which replicate the system of interest while allowing precise control of key parameters. Here we demonstrate the formation of highly tunable artificial crystals by superimposing a periodic electrostatic potential on the 2D electron gas in an ultra-shallow (25 nm deep) GaAs quantum well. The 100 nm period artificial crystal is identified by the formation of a new bandstructure, different from the original cubic crystal and specific to the artificial triangular lattice: transport measurements show the Hall coefficient changing sign as the chemical potential sweeps through the artificial bands. Uniquely, the artificial bandstructure can be continuously tuned to form linear graphene-like and flat kagome-like bands in a single device. A strong insulating state is observed at half filling of the kagome flat band, which is not expected in the absence of strong interactions. This state, unique to the kagome lattice, is consistent with a loop-current Wigner insulator, which arises from long-range Coulomb interaction and delocalised electrons between neighbouring empty sites. The ability to continuously tune the bandstructure and access flat bands through electrical gating within a single device opens a new route to studying collective quantum states.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Suppl.: 16 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01738v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hopf terms are topological theta terms that are associated with a host of interesting physics, including anyons, statistical transmutation, chiral edge states, and the quantum spin-Hall effect. Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $θ$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $π$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital Altermagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00509v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of \emph{orbital altermagnetism}, a symmetry-protected magnetic order of pure orbital degrees of freedom. It is characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking. First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$, so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand, it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO. The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.</p></details> | 16 Page, 9 Figures |
| **[Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagomé metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting state in a kagomé lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |

Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagomé lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagomé lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagomé metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagomé lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |

Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $κ_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

This choice of orbitals is limited by strong technical constraints as one must be able to compute a large number of six dimensional Coulomb integrals from these orbitals. Here we use tensor network techniques to construct representations of orbitals that essentially lift these technical constraints. We show that a large class of orbitals can be put into ``tensorized'' form including the Gaussian orbitals, Slater orbitals, linear combination thereof as well as new orbitals beyond the above. Our method provides a path for building more accurate and more compact basis sets beyond what has been accessible with previous technology. As an illustration, we construct optimized tensorized orbitals and obtain a 85% reduction of the error on the energy of the $H_2$ molecules with respect to a reference double zeta calculation (cc-pvDz) of the same size.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Compiling Quantum Regular Language States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02698v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State preparation compilers for quantum computers typically sit at two extremes: general-purpose routines that treat the target as an opaque amplitude vector, and bespoke constructions for a handful of well-known state families. We ask whether a compiler can instead accept simple, structure-aware specifications while providing predictable resource guarantees. We answer this by designing and implementing a quantum state-preparation compiler for regular language states (RLS): uniform superpositions over bitstrings accepted by a regular description, and their complements. Users describe the target state via (i) a finite set of bitstrings, (ii) a regular expression, or (iii) a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), optionally with a complement flag. By translating the input to a DFA, minimizing it, and mapping it to an optimal matrix product state (MPS), the compiler obtains an intermediate representation (IR) that exposes and compresses hidden structure. The efficient DFA representation and minimization offloads expensive linear algebra computation in exchange of simpler automata manipulations. The combination of the regular-language frontend and this IR gives concise specifications not only for RLS but also for their complements that might otherwise require exponentially large state descriptions. This enables state preparation of an RLS or its complement with the same asymptotic resources and compile time. We outline two hardware-aware backends: SeqRLSP, which yields linear-depth, ancilla-free circuits for linear nearest-neighbor architectures via sequential generation, and TreeRLSP, which achieves logarithmic depth on all-to-all connectivity via a tree tensor network. We prove depth and gate-count bounds scaling with the system size and the state's maximal Schmidt rank, and we give explicit compile-time bounds that expose the benefit of our approach. We implement and evaluate the pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/reinisirmejs/RLSComp</p></details> |
| **[Approaching the Thermodynamic Limit with Neural-Network Quantum States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02665v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accessing the thermodynamic-limit properties of strongly correlated quantum matter requires simulations on very large lattices, a regime that remains challenging for numerical methods, especially in frustrated two-dimensional systems. We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations. We finally demonstrate the generality of the method by obtaining state-of-the-art energies for a $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a $20\times20$ square lattice, outperforming Residual Convolutional Neural Networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sampling two-dimensional isometric tensor network states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02245v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling a quantum systems underlying probability distributions is an important computational task, e.g., for quantum advantage experiments and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. Tensor networks are an invaluable tool for efficiently representing states of large quantum systems with limited entanglement. Algorithms for sampling one-dimensional (1D) tensor networks are well-established and utilized in several 1D tensor network methods. In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of algorithms for 1D tensor networks. The first algorithm we propose performs independent sampling and yields a single configuration together with its associated probability. The second algorithm employs a greedy search strategy to identify K high-probability configurations and their corresponding probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms across quantum states with varying entanglement and system size.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

While machine learning (ML) has shown promise as an alternative paradigm, most applications remain at the proof-of-concept stage, focusing narrowly on energy estimation at the lower end of the spectrum. Here, we push ML beyond this frontier by extensively testing HubbardNet, a deep neural network architecture for the Bose-Hubbard model. Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Scalable Tensor Network Simulation for Quantum-Classical Dual Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01330v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an efficient and scalable tensor network framework for quantum kernel circuit simulation, alleviating practical costs associated with increasing qubit counts and data size. The framework enables systematic large-scale evaluation of a linearly mixed quantum-classical dual kernel of up to 784 qubits. Using Fashion-MNIST, the classification performance of the test dataset is compared between a classical kernel, a quantum kernel, and the quantum-classical dual kernel across the feature dimensions from 2 to 784, with a one-to-one mapping between encoded features and qubits. Our result shows that the quantum-classical dual kernel consistently outperforms both single-kernel baselines, remains stable as the dimensionality increases, and mitigates the large-scale degradation observed in the quantum kernel. Analysis of the learned mixing weights indicates that quantum contributions dominate below 128 features, while classical contributions become increasingly important beyond 128, suggesting that the classical kernel provides a stabilizing anchor against concentration effects and hardware noise while preserving quantum gains at lower dimensions.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the interaction effects on topological phases within realistic model presents a significant theoretical challenge. Here, we construct a moiré superlattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich variety of interaction-driven and filling-dependent topological phases, including FCIs, Chern insulators, and generalized Wigner crystals, which are revealed in recent experiments. For FCI state, dynamical simulations uncover a single-particle excitation continuum with a finite charge gap, reflecting the fractionalized charge excitations. Finite-temperature calculations further determine characteristic charge activation and ferromagnetic transition temperatures, reconciling existing experimental discrepancies. Furthermore, using this realistic lattice model, we predict the presence of quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional fillings in tMoTe$_2$. By integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical analyses, our work establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related moiré systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+13...</summary><p>12+13 pages, 6+11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Quantum Inner Product Estimation with Structured Random Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19574v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed inner product estimation (DIPE) is a fundamental task in quantum information, aiming to estimate the inner product between two unknown quantum states prepared on distributed quantum platforms. Existing rigorous sample complexity analyses are limited to unitary $4$-designs, which pose significant practical challenges for near-term quantum devices. This work addresses this challenge by exploring DIPE with structured random circuits. We first establish that DIPE with an arbitrary unitary $2$-design ensemble achieves an average sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{2^n})$, where $n$ is the number of qubits. We then analyze ensembles below unitary $2$-designs -- specifically, the brickwork and local unitary $2$-design ensembles -- demonstrating average sample complexities of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{2.18^n})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{2.5^n})$, respectively. Furthermore, we analyze the state-dependent sample complexity. For brickwork ensembles, we develop a tensor network approach to compute the asymptotic state-dependent sample complexity, showing that it converges to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{2.18^n})$ as the circuit depth increases. Remarkably, we find that DIPE with the global Clifford ensemble requires $Θ(\sqrt{2^n})$ copies, matching the performance of unitary $4$-designs. For both local and global Clifford ensembles, we find that the efficiency can be further enhanced by the nonstabilizerness of states. Additionally, for approximate unitary $4$-designs, the performance exponentially approaches that of exact unitary $4$-designs as the circuit depth increases. Our results provide theoretically guaranteed methods for implementing DIPE with experimentally feasible unitary ensembles.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been selected for an oral talk at AQIS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Entanglement-Dependent Error Bounds for Hamiltonian Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00555v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish tight connections between entanglement entropy and the approximation error in Trotter-Suzuki product formulas for Hamiltonian simulation. Product formulas remain the workhorse of quantum simulation on near-term devices, yet standard error analyses yield worst-case bounds that can vastly overestimate the resources required for structured problems. For systems governed by geometrically local Hamiltonians with maximum entanglement entropy $S_\text{max}$ across all bipartitions, we prove that the first-order Trotter error scales as $\mathcal{O}(t^2 S_\text{max} \operatorname{polylog}(n)/r)$ rather than the worst-case $\mathcal{O}(t^2 n/r)$, where $n$ is the system size and $r$ is the number of Trotter steps. This yields improvements of $\tildeΩ(n^2)$ for one-dimensional area-law systems and $\tildeΩ(n^{3/2})$ for two-dimensional systems. We extend these bounds to higher-order Suzuki formulas, where the improvement factor involves $2^{pS^*/2}$ for the $p$-th order formula. We further establish a separation result demonstrating that volume-law entangled systems fundamentally require $\tildeΩ(n)$ more Trotter steps than area-law systems to achieve the same precision. This separation is tight up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis combines Lieb-Robinson bounds for locality, tensor network representations for entanglement structure, and novel commutator-entropy inequalities that bound the expectation value of nested commutators by the Schmidt rank of the state. These results have immediate applications to quantum chemistry, condensed matter simulation, and resource estimation for fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Floquet-Thermalization via Instantons near Dynamical Freezing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10498v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>(v1) ...</summary><p>(v1) 21pages, 13 figures; (v2) 30 pages including supplement, 9 + 6 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

The method leverages pre-computed QAOA angles, derived from depth-$p$ QAOA circuits on regular trees, to compute local expectation values and inform sequential greedy decisions that progressively build an independent set. This hybrid approach maintains shallow quantum circuit and avoids instance-specific parameter training, making it well-suited for implementation on current quantum hardware: we have implemented the algorithm on a 20 qubit IQM superconducting device to find independent sets in graphs with thousands of nodes. We perform tensor network simulations to evaluate the performance of the algorithm beyond the reach of current quantum hardware and compare to established classical heuristics. Our results show that even at low depth ($p=4$), the quantum-enhanced greedy method significantly outperforms purely classical greedy baselines as well as more sophisticated approximation algorithms. The modular structure of the algorithm and relatively low quantum resource requirements make it a compelling candidate for scalable, hybrid optimization in the NISQ era and beyond.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Quantum LEGO Learning: A Modular Design Principle for Hybrid Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21780v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.</p></details> | In submission |

We introduce a symplectic optimization framework that addresses this challenge by parameterizing covariance matrices directly as positive-definite symplectic matrices using unit-triangular factorizations. This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids. We demonstrate the method on weakly dipole-coupled lattices, recovering ground-state energies, covariance matrices, and spectral gaps accurately. The framework further provides a foundation for large-scale approximate treatments of weakly non-quadratic interactions and offers potential scaling advantages through tensor-network enhancements.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</p></details> |  |

Our framework relies on two schemes based on Monte Carlo sampling to quantify non-stabilizerness via Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE) in arbitrary variational wave functions. When combined with NQS, this approach is effective for systems with strong correlations and in dimensions larger than one, unlike Tensor Network methods. Firstly, we study the magic content in an ensemble of random NQS, demonstrating that neural network parametrizations of the wave function capture finite non-stabilizerness besides large entanglement. Secondly, we investigate the non-stabilizerness in the ground state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. In 1D, we find that the SRE vanishes at the Majumdar-Ghosh point $J_2 = J_1/2$, consistent with a stabilizer ground state. In 2D, a dip in the SRE is observed near maximum frustration around $J_2/J_1 \approx 0.6$, suggesting a Valence Bond Solid between the two antiferromagnetic phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 + 6...</summary><p>6 + 6 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

We add to this effort by introducing a new algorithm that efficiently applies tree tensor network operators to tree tensor network states inspired by the density matrix method and the Cholesky decomposition. This application procedure is a common subroutine in tensor network methods. We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures. Additionally, our CBC still performs among the most successful methods, showing less dependence on the different bond dimensions of the operator.</p></details> | <details><summary>(8 fi...</summary><p>(8 figures, 15 pages)</p></details> |
| **[GCAMPS: A Scalable Classical Simulator for Qudit Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06672v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical simulations of quantum systems are notoriously difficult computational problems, with conventional state vector and tensor network methods restricted to quantum systems that feature only a small number of qudits. The recently introduced Clifford Augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) method offer scalability and efficiency by combining both tensor network and stabilizer simulation techniques and leveraging their complementary advantages. This hybrid simulation method has indeed demonstrated significant improvements in simulation performance for qubit circuits. Our work generalises the CAMPS method to higher quantum degrees of freedom -- qudit simulation, resulting in a generalised CAMPS (GCAMPS). Benchmarking this extended simulator on quantum systems with three degrees of freedom, i.e. qutrits, we show that similar to the case of qubits, qutrit systems also benefit from a comparable speedup using these techniques. Indeed, we see a greater improvement with qutrit simulation compared to qubit simulation on the same $T$-doped random Clifford benchmarking circuit as a result of the increased difficulty of conventional qutrit simulation using tensor networks. This extension allows for the classical simulation of problems that were previously intractable without access to a quantum device and will open new avenues to study complex many-body physics and to develop efficient methods for quantum information processing.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Despite its importance, consensus on the precise critical exponents remains elusive due to severe finite-size effects in numerical simulations and the lack of conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model, including the first QMC determination of the fermion anomalous dimension, show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+20...</summary><p>12+20 pages, 6+16 figures</p></details> |

Here we combine DFT+$U$, finite-temperature DMFT with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations to investigate Li$^+$ migration for a single Li vacancy in paramagnetic Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $μ^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders. Our results highlight the importance of finite-temperature dynamical correlations for Li-ion migration in correlated oxides and provide a framework for incorporating strong Coulomb interactions in future studies of transition-metal oxide battery materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of algorithms for 1D tensor networks. The first algorithm we propose performs independent sampling and yields a single configuration together with its associated probability. The second algorithm employs a greedy search strategy to identify K high-probability configurations and their corresponding probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms across quantum states with varying entanglement and system size.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05222v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr{ö}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or extensive datasets, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as Density Functional Theory. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires 6$N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces. This paper presents a way to replace the 6$N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the unbiased VMC forces with those obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones. Our benchmark test also reveals that the unbiased VMC forces yield very consistent values with hybrid and meta GGAs, but do not necessarily yield values that are very close to those of CCSD(T).</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory to Explore the Electronic Structure Under Extreme Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23002v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in X-ray free-electron laser diagnostics have enabled direct probing of the electronic structure under extreme pressures and temperatures, such as those encountered in stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion experiments, challenging theoretical models for interpreting experimental data. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) has been successfully applied to analyze experimental X-ray scattering measurements, but its high computational cost renders routine application impractical. Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT. We further show that even at temperatures on the order of 100 eV, quantum non-locality remains essential for correctly describing the electronic structure of dense hydrogen.</p></details> |  |

With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published version with minor changes</p></details> |

| **[Two-Point Stabilizer Rényi Entropy: a Computable Magic Proxy of Interacting Fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13314v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying non-stabilizerness (``magic'') in interacting fermionic systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly for extracting high order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this Letter, we establish the two-point stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart as robust, computationally accessible probes for detecting magic in diverse fermionic phases. By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-precision ground state parameters of the two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20189v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several ground state properties of the square-lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet are computed (the energy, order parameter, spin stiffness, spinwave velocity, long-wavelength susceptibility, and staggered susceptibility) using extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the stochastic series expansion method. Moderately sized lattices are studied at temperatures $T$ sufficiently low to realize the $T \to 0$ limit. Results for periodic $L\times L$ lattices with $L \in [6,96]$ are tabulated versus $L$ and extrapolations to infinite system size are carried out. The extrapolated ground state energy density is $e_0=-0.669441857(7)$, which represents an improvement in precision of three orders of magnitude over the previously best result. The leading and subleading finite-size corrections to $e_0$ are in full quantitative agreement with predictions from chiral perturbation theory, thus further supporting the soundness of both the extrapolations and the theory. The extrapolated sublattice magnetization is $m_s=0.307447(2)$, which agrees well with previous estimates but with a much smaller statistical error. The coefficient of the linear in $L^{-1}$ correction to $m^2_s$ agrees with the value from chiral perturbation theory and the presence of a factor $\ln^γ(L)$ in the second-order correction is also confirmed, with the previously not known value of the exponent being $γ= 0.82(4)$. The finite-size corrections to the staggered susceptibility point to logarithmic corrections also in this quantity. To facilitate benchmarking of methods for which periodic boundary conditions are challenging, results for systems with open and cylindrical boundaries are also listed and their spatially inhomogeneous order parameters are analyzed.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Superfluidity in the spin-1/2 XY model with power-law interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20058v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In trapped-ion quantum simulators, effective spin-1/2 XY interactions can be engineered via laser-induced coupling between internal atomic states and collective phonon modes. In the simplest one-dimensional ($1d$) traps, these interactions decay as a power-law with distance $1/r^α$, with a tunable exponent $α$. For small $α$, the resulting long-range $1d$ XY model exhibits continuous symmetry breaking, in marked contrast to its nearest neighbor counterpart. In this paper, we examine this model near the phase transition at $α_c$ from the lens of the spin stiffness, or superfluid density. We develop a stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation and a generalized winding number estimator to measure the superfluid density in the presence of power-law interactions, which we test against exact diagonalization for small lattice sizes. Our results show how conventional superfluidity in the $1d$ XY model is enhanced in the long-range interacting regime. This is observed as a diverging superfluid density as $α\rightarrow 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, which we show is consistent with linear spin-wave theory. Finally, we define a normalized superfluid density estimator that clearly distinguishes the short, medium, and long-range interacting regimes, providing a novel QMC probe of the critical value $α_c$.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Observation of emergent scaling of spin-charge correlations at the onset of the pseudogap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17801v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual "pseudogap" metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of dopings and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal scaling behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations characterised by a doping-dependent temperature scale. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this temperature scale is comparable to the pseudogap temperature T*. Our quantitative findings reveal a novel qualitative behaviour of magnetic properties and spin-charge correlations in an emergent pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of charge pairing and collective phenomena expected at lower temperatures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 + 1...</summary><p>8 + 11 pages, 5 + 10 figures.

| **[Cooper Condensation and Pair Wave Functions in Strongly Correlated Electrons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18868v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

Our approach extends a previously developed PMR-QMC method for spin-1/2 Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013281 (2024)]. Because it does not rely on a local bond decomposition, the method applies equally well to models with arbitrary connectivities, long-range and multi-spin interactions, and its closed-walk formulation allows a natural analysis of sign-problem conditions in terms of cycle weights. To demonstrate its applicability and versatility, we apply our method to spin-1 and spin-3/2 quantum Heisenberg models on the square lattice, as well as to randomly generated high-spin Hamiltonians. Additionally, we show how the approach naturally extends to general Hamiltonians involving mixtures of particle species, including bosons and fermions.

| **[Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13121v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $λ$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments are welcome.

In stark contrast to findings in $J$-$Q$ models and other candidates, the universal logarithmic correction coefficients for both quantities are found to be {positive}, consistent with a unitary conformal field theory (CFT). Crucially, the current central charge $C_J$, extracted from the small-angle behavior of the disorder operator, is enhanced by a factor of approximately {4/3} compared to that of the conventional 3D $O(2)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This enhancement {implies} a consistent explanation in the recently observed low-energy excitation spectrum at this DQCP, which features {two distinct linearly dispersing modes} with a velocity ratio of approximately three. Our results provide evidence that this quantum phase transition constitutes a genuine DQCP, characterized by coexisting fractionalized excitations that collectively modify its critical properties.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we employ sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to systematically investigate a bilayer fermionic model featuring strong interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange and on-site repulsive Hubbard interactions. This system serves as a prototypical model for realizing a symmetric mass generation (SMG) insulator. Our numerically exact results unambiguously demonstrate that robust superconducting pairing emerges upon doping the SMG phase. Remarkably, we find that the SC order is significantly enhanced by the repulsive Hubbard interaction. Given its potential relevance to the essential features of the high-$T_c$ superconductor $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ under pressure, our study establishes a new paradigm for superconductivity arising from a doped SMG parent state and provides key theoretical guidance for future experimental investigations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

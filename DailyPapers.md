| **[Prediction of superconductivity in mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07729v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study density-balanced, mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers as a tunable platform for correlated quantum phases. With independent control of carrier density and interlayer separation, the system exhibits a rich phase diagram, including exciton condensates, Wigner crystals, and for large hole-to-electron mass ratios, an electron-liquid hole-crystal phase. This mixed phase is an analog of two-dimensional metallic hydrogen, featuring an electron liquid immersed in and coupled to a lattice of heavy holes. We show that acoustic plasmons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons, leading to BCS-type superconductivity at experimentally accessible parameters. The superconducting transition temperature is calculated from first principles, and experimental realization in van der Waals heterostructures is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 + 7...</summary><p>7 + 7 pages, 4 + 7 figures</p></details> |

We predict that the strong photon-photon interactions provided by the intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions are sufficient to enter a regime of strongly interacting photons for realistic parameters. A suitable tapering of the transmission line parameters allows for the adiabatic conversion of an incident coherent field into a Tonks-Girardeau gas of fermionized photons close to its ground state. Signatures of the strong correlations are anticipated in the correlation properties of the transmitted light.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages, 3+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Developments in superconducting erasure qubits for hardware-efficient quantum error correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02183v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers are inherently noisy, and a crucial challenge for achieving large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing is to implement quantum error correction. A promising direction that has made rapid recent progress is to design hardware that has a specific noise profile, leading to a significantly higher threshold for noise with certain quantum error correcting codes. This Perspective focuses on erasure qubits, which enable hardware-efficient quantum error correction, by concatenating an inner code built-in to the hardware with an outer code. We focus on implementations of dual-rail encoded erasure qubits using superconducting qubits, giving an overview of recent developments in theory and simulation, and hardware demonstrators. We also discuss the differences between implementations; near-term applications using quantum error detection; and the open problems for developing this approach towards early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transverse superconducting diode without parity and time-reversal violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01560v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by its nonreciprocal nature in critical supercurrents. However, realizing a longitudinal SDE typically requires simultaneous time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) symmetry breaking in the device, raising challenges in applications. In this Letter, we reveal that an off-axis direct-current bias applied to a planar anisotropic superconductor can convert intrinsic anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, generating ultra-tunable SDE without breaking either $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Using both Ginzburg-Landau theory and self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that diode efficiency can be continuously tuned via bias current amplitude. Notably, when the injected bias current exceeds a critical threshold, the system is driven into a ``unidirectional superconductivity" regime, where transverse dissipationless currents are permitted in only one direction. Based on this mechanism, we propose the ``current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST)" and demonstrate its utility in tunable supercurrent range controllers and half-wave rectifiers. Our findings open new avenues for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, with Supplemental Material</p></details> |
| **[Van der Waals superconducting electronics: materials, devices and circuit integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07018v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors - atomically thin crystalline materials that can be stacked into more complex heterostructures - have opened a promising avenue for superconducting electronics thanks to their properties that are otherwise difficult to obtain in other superconducting materials. These include strong resilience to high in-plane fields, electrostatic tuneability, and non-reciprocal transport rooted in inversion-symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling. In addition to highlighting the importance of these properties for superconducting electronics, this review gives an overview over the physical mechanisms that govern and influence superconductivity in vdW materials including Ising pairing, band inversion, and proximity effects at superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces that do not have an equivalent in thin-film systems. This overview then sets the basis to survey the wide range of functionalities enabled by superconducting vdW devices including gate-controlled devices, superconducting diodes, and circuit elements for readout and control of quantum bits. The review concludes with a forward look at wafer-scale growth and deterministic assembly of vdW devices, highlighting concrete pathways that can enable the transition from vdW device prototypes to deployable components for cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18441v3)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Altermagnetism-driven FFLO superconductivity in finite-filling 2D lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06735v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We systematically investigate the emergence of finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity in a square lattice Hubbard model with finite filling, driven by either $d_{xy}$-wave or $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetic order in the presence of on-site $s$-wave attractive interactions. Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity. These findings may provide guidance for experimental exploration of altermagnetism-induced FFLO states in real materials with more complex electronic structures.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[The Impact of Ionic Anharmonicity on Superconductivity in Metal-Stuffed B-C Clathrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12068v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal-stuffed B$-$C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have captured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptional superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure. However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art ab initio methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a series of $XY$$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ clathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes, enabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported ($XY$)$^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures. Further calculations based on the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation demonstrate that the $T_\text{c}$ values for KRb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ and Rb$\text{B}_{3}\text{C}_{3}$ among these stabilized compounds are 102 and 115 K at 0 and 15 GPa, respectively, both being higher than $T_\text{c}$ of 92 K of KPb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ at the anharmonic level. These record-high $T_\text{c}$ values, surpassing liquid nitrogen temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength and advancing the search for high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity at (near) ambient pressure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06504v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films grown on SrF2(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal a superconducting transition at $T_{\mathrm c}=1.72$ K. The field-induced broadening of the transition and the presence of finite upper critical fields are consistent with type-II superconductivity. We determine the resistively defined upper critical fields for magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the film plane and parameterize their temperature dependence using an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau approach. For the thickest film ($d=50$ nm), this yields coherence lengths of $ξ_{ab}\approx 55$ nm and $ξ_c\approx 14$ nm. Current-voltage characteristics show sizeable critical currents, with a critical current density reaching $J_{\mathrm c}\approx 6e4$ A/cm$^2$ at 0.5 K. These results establish epitaxial PtSb as a superconducting thin-film platform compatible with lattice-matched heterostructures in the NiAs-type materials family.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Enhanced superconducting correlations in the Emery model and its connections to strange metallic transport and normal state coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03958v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for a superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear resistivity, the three-band model crosses the resistivity of the single-band model from above, indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. The enhanced conductivity is mainly contributed by a steep increase in the diffusivity of the three-band model at the crossover, suggesting that three-band transport is more coherent than single-band transport at lower temperatures. Below the same crossover temperature in the three-band model, the pair-field susceptibility increases more steeply than at higher temperatures or when compared to the single-band model. This suggests a possible connection between superconductivity and coherent transport, and further implies that coherent transport might be necessary for a model to capture the high-temperature superconductivity observed in hole-doped cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures (main text)</p></details> |
| **[Coexistence of superconductivity and charge density wave in a correlated regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06326v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To investigate the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) in a correlated regime, we employ the Green's functions formalism, as well as the Hubbard-I approximation, as a way to introduce the correlations into the problem, in the form of a repulsive Coulomb interaction $U$. In addition, we investigate the effects of second-nearest neighbor hopping $t_1$ on a pure CDW state. The analysis of the results show that, for small values of $t_1$, both CDW and superconducting gaps compete for the same region on the Fermi surface. The increase of $t_1$ decreases the competition and may lead the system to a coexistence regime. Effects of temperature in the coexistence regime, are also investigated.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Low-loss Nb on Si superconducting resonators from a dual-use spintronics deposition chamber and with acid-free post-processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13285v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used for this purpose; with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (\SI{3}{\micro\meter} gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal. These results will inform nanofabrication for other superconducting materials and the integration of magnetic materials for hybrid systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting superconductivity in ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ films via nanofaceted substrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03986v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cuprate high-temperature superconductors the doping level is fixed during synthesis, hence the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike in 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Heterostructures on a Honeycomb Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05662v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Altermagnet-superconductor heterostructures have been shown, in principle, to provide a route towards realising topological superconductivity, and therefore host topologically protected boundary states. In this work we demonstrate that the topological states observed are dependent on the structure of the underlying lattice. By deriving and analysing a model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the topological phase diagram has a rich structure containing both chiral edge modes and Majorana corner modes, the latter of which are an indication of higher-order topology. We analyse the effect of disorder on these states and find that whilst the edge modes are robust to a disordered system, any potential observation of the corner modes may be sensitive to the microscopic details. In particular, we show that vacancies can lead to other low energy bound states that may be difficult to distinguish from the corner modes.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Pervasive spin-triplet superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16578v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moiré superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.</p></details> | 27 pages, 28 figures |
| **[Effect of Underlayer Induced Charge Carrier Substitution on the Superconductivity of Ti40V60 Alloy Thin Films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20242v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of metallic and semiconducting (V, Al, and Si) under-layer induced charge carrier substitution on the superconducting properties of the Ti40V60 alloy thin films are studied and also compared with a pristine reference film without any under-layer. All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder, yet yields the highest TC. This indicates that in the Ti40V60 alloys, a moderate amount of disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations (inherent to the alloy system) induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the film with V under-layer and the film without under-layer, and the much smaller coherence length (~6.2 nm) as compared to the film thickness (25 nm), confirm the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries in Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb thin films for superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05326v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on atomic-scale analyses of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) of Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb (Ta/Nb) thin films for superconducting qubits using atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We observe oxygen segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) relative to the oxygen concentration within the grains for both Nb and Ta-capped Nb thin films for superconducting qubits and find that higher oxygen concentration in the interior of Nb grains lead to greater oxygen segregation levels at GBs. This finding emphasizes that controlling oxygen impurities in Nb during film deposition and fabrication processing is important to reduce the level of oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb. The enrichment factor (Cgb/Cgrain) for oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb is 2.7 (error bar: 0.3) for Nb films, and Ta-capped Nb thin films exhibit slightly reduced Nb GB enrichment factors of 2.3 (error bar: 0.3) while GBs in the Ta capping layer itself possess higher enrichment factors of 3.0 (error bar: 0.3). We hypothesize that the Ta capping layer can trap oxygen and thereby affect oxygen in-diffusion and segregation at GBs in the underlying Nb thin films. Finally, we find that increases in the oxygen concentration in both Nb grains and GBs correlate with a suppression in the critical temperature for superconductivity (Tc). Together, our comparative chemical and charge transport property analyses provide atomic-scale insights into a potential mechanism contributing to decoherence in superconducting qubits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Suppression of XY Crosstalk by Pulse-Level Control in Superconducting Quantum Processors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05231v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As superconducting quantum processors continue to scale, high-performance quantum control becomes increasingly critical. In densely integrated architectures, unwanted interactions between nearby qubits give rise to crosstalk errors that limit operational performance. In particular, direct exchange-type (XY) interactions are typically minimized by designing large frequency detunings between neighboring qubits at the hardware level. However, frequency crowding in large-scale systems ultimately restricts the achievable frequency separation. While such XY coupling facilitates entangling gate operations, its residual presence poses a key challenge during single-qubit controls. Here, we propose a scalable pulse-level control framework, incorporating frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD), to suppress XY crosstalk errors. This framework operates independently of coupling strengths, reducing calibration overhead and naturally supporting multi-qubit connectivity. Numerical simulations show orders-of-magnitude reductions in infidelity for both idle and single-qubit gates in a two-qubit system. We further validate scalability in a five-qubit layout, where crosstalk between a central qubit and four neighbors is simultaneously suppressed. Our crosstalk suppression framework provides a practical route toward high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures.</p></details> | 19 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Unconventional superconductivity mediated by exciton density wave fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09148v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+11 ...</summary><p>6+11 pages, 5+6 figures; the first two authors contributed equally to this work. v2 expands discussion on experimental signatures and pairing mediated by Goldstone modes</p></details> |
| **[Single-enantiomer spin polarisers in superconducting junctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04772v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiral matter acting as a spin-selective device in biased electron transport is attracting attention for the quantum-technological design of miniaturized electronics. To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule. The experiments unveil the role of the enantiomers as spin polarisers and the irrelevance of electrostatics in the chosen model system.</p></details> |  |

Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p></details> |  |

Our method involves the Dyson-Maleev transformation, for which we develop a procedure to circumvent its inherent non-Hermiticity, yielding the extended Bose-Hubbard (EBH) Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the equivalence of this approach to the Holstein-Primakoff encoding for spin-1/2 systems. For the experimental realization of this EBH model, we design a scalable circuit-QED architecture based on an engineered Josephson junction array. Numerical simulations confirm that the microwave photon dynamics in this simulator accurately reproduces the original spin dynamics. Our work establishes an experimentally accessible method for investigating complex quantum spin dynamics in a highly controllable bosonic setting.</p></details> | 6 figures, 19 pages |

By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity. Notably, we propose a unified framework linking disorder-driven localization to deterministic phase frustration, identifying the Bubble Phase as a pristine, disorder-free archetype of the Bose glass. Our results provide a theoretical blueprint for realizing glassy dynamics in clean quantum simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

The electron-doped case has a nested Fermi surface in the non-interacting limit, and hence a weak-coupling instability towards density-wave orders whose wavevectors are determined by Fermi surface nesting conditions. We find that at moderate to strong interaction strengths other spatially-modulated orders arise, with wavevectors distinct from the nesting vectors. In particular, we identify a series closely-competing itinerant long-wavelength magnetically ordered states, yielding to uniform ferromagnetic order at the largest interaction strengths. For half-hole doping and a similar range of interaction strengths, our data indicate that magnetic orders are most likely absent.</p></details> | 4+2 pages |
| **[Construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states in the SU($N$) Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04640v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.</p></details> |  |

The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles through the \emph{inter-flavor mutual information}, an experimentally accessible quantity that rigorously measures the distance from the closest gaussian state, unveiling features that cannot be accessed by conventional probes of Mottness. We prove that these correlations are fully independent from local entanglement and quantum discord, and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + references, 8 figures.

We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales.</p></details> |  |

In semiconductors, it drives the Rashba spin splitting and spin momentum locking, while in magnetic insulators based on transition metals, it induces anisotropic spin exchange interactions, like the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which drives chiral magnetism and skyrmion formation. Here, we establish a direct connection between SOC and spin exchange interactions by deriving an effective spin model from the SOC Hubbard model at half-filling. Using a strong-coupling expansion up to fourth order by including the full set of terms, we identify Heisenberg, Ising-like, and ring exchange interactions, as well as a variety of four-body terms for realistic Hubbard parameters, which impose strong constraints on the relative strengths of the spin interactions. Our spin model shows excellent agreement in energy with the SOC Hubbard model down $U/t \sim 5$ near the metal-insulator transition point, providing insight to which kind of magnetic interactions relevant across this regime are responsible for the emergence of complex magnetic textures.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

In the limit of both large number of colors $N$ and particles, and small number of sites $L \geq 2$, the model is proved to undergo a $\mathbb{Z}_L$ symmetry breaking for attractive local interaction amplitude $U$. Using a combination of Exact Diagonalization with full SU(N) symmetry, generalized L-levels Holstein-Primakoff transformation, Hartree-Fock method and large-N saddle point approximation of the partition function, we extend the results obtained in [PRA 111, L020201 (2025)] to $L \geq 3$ and finite temperature $T>0$. In particular, we show that at $T=0$ for $U<U_c\sim -1/N$, the ground state is L-fold degenerate, while for positive temperatures, the critical temperature is both proportional to $N$ and $U$, i.e. $T_c \propto -U N$, making this phase transition particularly suitable for large-N fermions.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in the kagome Hubbard model under the flat-band-preserving disorder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00540v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the disordered flat-band superconductivity within the attractive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by contrasting the flat-band-preserving disorder [Phys. Rev. B 98, 235109 (2018)] with the random hopping disorder that breaks the flat-band degeneracy. Through Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field calculations, we find that the superfluid weight is much more robust under the flat-band-preserving disorder, while the system eventually undergoes a transition to an insulator as disorder becomes strong enough. The almost linear interaction-dependence of the superfluid weight in the weak coupling limit found with the flat-band-preserving disorder confirms the persistent flat-band signature, whereas the exponential behavior of a dispersive-band character arises with the random hopping counterpart. In addition, in the exact diagonalization of the one-particle density matrix, we identify an occupation spectrum structure attributed to the flat-band states, demonstrating the connection between the resilient flat band and the enhanced robustness of superconductivity.</p></details> |  |

By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</p></details> |  |

The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating triangle Hofstadter-Hubbard model with fermionic projected entangled simplex states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21503v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The triangular Hofstadter-Hubbard model, realizable in moiré bilayers, provides a fertile ground for discovering correlated topological states. We investigate this model in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fermionic infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS) approach, which offers direct access to the stability of the emergent correlated states at the thermodynamic limit. Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility. Finite-correlation-length scaling of the magnetization reveals a transition into a large-$U$ $120^\circ$ Néel phase at $U_{c_2} \approx 22.5$. Remarkably, with finite hole doping $δ$, we identify a uniform superconducting state with a finite pairing amplitude, whose order parameter displays a nearly universal phase winding across the $U$-$δ$ phase diagram. Our work demonstrates robust chiral superconductivity in the thermodynamic limit through doping Chern insulator and CSL.</p></details> |  |

Such phase diagrams are traditionally constructed numerically, but we argue that, by using asymptotic techniques, it is possible to obtain analytic formulas approximating the curves separating the different phases to very high accuracy. To illustrate the new method, we apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at zero temperature. This yields formulas for the Hartree-Fock phase boundaries that agree with, but also improve on, earlier numerical results. In particular, our results provide the first rigorous proof of the existence of mixed phases in this model.</p></details> | 59 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Comparing Hubbard parameters from linear-response theory and Hartree-Fock-based approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16803v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06284v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical state-vector simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to ${6\times 6}$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including different on-site electron-electron interaction strengths and magnetic flux values, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons (charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation), dynamical symmetry-breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled background state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that meaningful programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now feasible on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p></details> | 94 pages, 76 figures |

In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</p></details> |  |

We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model.

We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures + supplemental</p></details> |

In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($δ\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $δ= 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $δ= 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</p></details> |  |

Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, updates have been made according to the feedback from referees</p></details> |

Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</p></details> | 31 pagesw, 3 figures |

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</p></details> |  |

Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n<1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+2 p...</summary><p>6+2 pages, 4+2 figures</p></details> |

Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($α,α^{\prime},β$) and two hole pockets ($γ,γ^{\prime}$), where the additional $α^{\prime}$ and $γ^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $γ$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the fate of the superconducting properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Strong-coupling study of the pairing mechanism in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12127v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity near $80$ K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Electronic Nematicity Revealed by Polarized Ultrafast Spectroscopy in Bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01702v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a polarized ultrafast pump-probe study of the normal-state electronic dynamics in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals at ambient pressure. While both nickelates exhibit density-wave (DW) transitions accompanied by the opening of a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck, their electronic responses display strikingly different symmetry properties. La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ maintains an isotropic optical response across the entire temperature range. In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K. The presence of macroscopic electronic anisotropy in the bilayer system, and its absence in the trilayer system, suggests an intimate relation between electronic nematic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ that worth for deeper explorations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% ($\sim$ 2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures.

Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\rm DW} \approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Magnetism of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22371v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the magnetic ground state of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates is crucial, as these materials exhibit superconductivity under high pressure and host competing electronic orders that may play a key role in the pairing mechanism. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $ΔT_{SDW} \simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p></details> |  |

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\it within} the $γ$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Using fully self-consistent DFT+$U$ calculations on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures, we identify that intrinsic hole doping via interfacial Sr interdiffusion is the decisive factor in stabilizing the metallic state. Our 1-unit-cell model accurately reproduces the ARPES-observed Fermi surface, particularly the critical Ni-$d_{z^2}$ derived $γ$ hole pocket, which originates exclusively from the interface-proximal bilayer. Furthermore, comparative tight-binding analysis suggests that the reduced superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in thin films stems from the synergistic suppression of the electronic density of states (DOS) and vertical superexchange coupling ($J \perp Z$). These findings highlight that interface engineering plays a critical role beyond simple strain imposition in modulating nickelate orbital physics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional Hubbard model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p></details> |  |

A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+3 ...</summary><p>10+3 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, supplemental material</p></details> |

In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $χ({\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the Néel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping).</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.</p></details> |  |

Yet, despite intense recent activity, we lack experimentally testable protocols for distinguishing between different pairing scenarios. In this Letter, we construct a minimal two-band model that reproduces the Fermi-surface topology observed in recent ARPES measurements and DFT calculations, and we analyze superconductivity arising from two distinct pairing mechanisms. We show that these mechanisms yield sharply different responses to an applied perpendicular electric field. Thus, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers the unique opportunity to cleanly distinguish between different pairing scenarios. Finally, we propose three concrete experimental proposals designed to distinguish these scenarios and thereby identify the pairing mechanism most relevant to the real material.</p></details> |  |

Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.</p></details> |  |

Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, including 5 pages and 4 figures of Supplementary Material, accepted for publication in Phys.

The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle Δ_{z}\rangle/\langleΔ_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>21+14...</summary><p>21+14 pages, 5+9 figures, 1+1 tables</p></details> |

Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity are observed in the longitudinal elastic mode $c_{11}$ for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$ from $b$-axis. We confirm an upper critical field of $H_{\rm c2}\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and bulk superconductivity which survives up to $T\approx 2$ K for fields above the metamagnetic transition. The $c_{11}$ mode has propagation and displacement vectors along the $a$-axis, and for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$, this mode is sensitive to the elasticity of the vortex lattice. The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material included</p></details> |

Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures (including SI)</p></details> |

We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p></details> |  |

| **[UTe$_2$: a narrow band superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07915v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $μ_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, submitted as regular article</p></details> |

Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15147v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

We show that the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit $H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to $\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry. It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.</p></details> | 41pages, 14figures |

In this paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a 72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $χ^b > χ^a > χ^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 = 0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $χ^a > χ^c > χ^b$, consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a* direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |

In ultra-clean single crystals, we identify a field-induced phase transition within the superconducting state at 5.6 T, driven by metamagnetism. This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.</p></details> |  |

At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($κ$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$κ$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $κ$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data.

The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 14 figures, to appear in Nature Physics (2025)</p></details> |

The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets. Our work provides a new perspective on collinear magnets and the spin-space group classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11982v4)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum XY model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two-dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moiré twisted bi-layer graphene and bilayer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear-in-temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those caused by Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature-independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln ω_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p></details> | 65 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Artificial electrostatic crystals: a new platform for creating correlated quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12769v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electronic properties of solids are determined by the crystal structure and interactions between electrons, giving rise to a variety of collective phenomena including superconductivity, strange metals and correlated insulators. The mechanisms underpinning many of these collective phenomena remain unknown, driving interest in creating artificial crystals which replicate the system of interest while allowing precise control of key parameters. Here we demonstrate the formation of highly tunable artificial crystals by superimposing a periodic electrostatic potential on the 2D electron gas in an ultra-shallow (25 nm deep) GaAs quantum well. The 100 nm period artificial crystal is identified by the formation of a new bandstructure, different from the original cubic crystal and specific to the artificial triangular lattice: transport measurements show the Hall coefficient changing sign as the chemical potential sweeps through the artificial bands. Uniquely, the artificial bandstructure can be continuously tuned to form linear graphene-like and flat kagome-like bands in a single device. A strong insulating state is observed at half filling of the kagome flat band, which is not expected in the absence of strong interactions. This state, unique to the kagome lattice, is consistent with a loop-current Wigner insulator, which arises from long-range Coulomb interaction and delocalised electrons between neighbouring empty sites. The ability to continuously tune the bandstructure and access flat bands through electrical gating within a single device opens a new route to studying collective quantum states.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Suppl.: 16 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of competing phases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01738v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hopf terms are topological theta terms that are associated with a host of interesting physics, including anyons, statistical transmutation, chiral edge states, and the quantum spin-Hall effect. Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $θ$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $π$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Orbital Altermagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00509v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of \emph{orbital altermagnetism}, a symmetry-protected magnetic order of pure orbital degrees of freedom. It is characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking. First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$, so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand, it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO. The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.</p></details> | 16 Page, 9 Figures |
| **[Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagomé metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the superconducting state in a kagomé lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04433v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+5 ...</summary><p>12+5 pages, 10+1 figures</p></details> |

Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p></details> | accepted version |

Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 + ...</summary><p>13 + 4 pages; 6+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagomé lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagomé lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagomé metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagomé lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09316v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p></details> |  |

Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11886</p></details> |

However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $κ_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120°, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>18+4 ...</summary><p>18+4 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Connecting such bosonic $π$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $π$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

In particular, they can fluctuate and give rise to massless low energy degrees of freedom even in the presence of a gapped bulk. In this work, we present the first tensor-network study of the paradigmatic interface roughening transition of the 3-D Ising model using highly asymmetric lattices that are infinite in the $(xy)$ direction and finite in $z$. By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$). For antiperiodic boundary conditions, we obtain an effective $\mathbb{Z}_q$ clock model description with $q=2L_z$ that exhibits an intermediate Luttinger liquid phase with an emergent $\U(1)$ symmetry.</p></details> |  |

A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (11 main, 5 appendix). 13 figures (8 main, 5 appendix). v2: fixed typos, restructured Sec.V.C., cleared up Fig.G.1., noted new preprint on similar topic announced after v1, included author contributions</p></details> |

The construction embeds each TN as a local isometry and dilates it to a unitary. Performing this step for every site of the tensor, allows the full network to be block-encoded. The theory is agnostic to virtual-bond sizes; for qubit resource counts and examples we assume global power-of-two padding. Further, we present a deterministic sweep that maps Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) / Ising Hamiltonians into Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) and general TN. We provide formal statements, pseudo-code, resource formulae, and a discussion of the use for state preparation and learning of general quantum operators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measurement-induced entanglement in noisy 2D random Clifford circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12743v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study measurement-induced entanglement generated by column-by-column sampling of noisy 2D random Clifford circuits of size $N$ and depth $T$. Focusing on the operator entanglement $S_{\rm op}$ of the sampling-induced boundary state, first, we reproduce in the noiseless limit a finite-depth transition from area- to volume-law scaling. With on-site probablistic trace noise at any constant rate $p>0$, the maximal $S_{\rm op}$ attained along the sampling trajectory obeys an area law in the boundary length and scales approximately linearly with $T/p$. By analyzing the spatial distribution of stabilizer generators, we observe exponential localization of stabilizer generators; this both accounts for the scaling of the maximal $S_{\rm op}$ and implies an exponential decay of conditional mutual information across buffered tripartitions, which we also confirm numerically. Together, these results indicate that constant local noise destroys long-range, volume-law measurement-induced entanglement in 2D random Clifford circuits. Finally, based on the observed scaling, we conjecture that a tensor-network-based algorithm can efficiently sample from noisy 2D random Clifford circuits (i) at sub-logarithmic depths $T = o(\log N)$ for any constant noise rate $p = Ω(1)$, and (ii) at constant depths $T = O(1)$ for noise rates $p = Ω(\log^{-1}N)$. Finally, we turn to Haar-random circuits of depth $T = 4$, where we observe numerically the same qualitative behavior as in the Clifford circuit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

We study this contribution through the lens of lattice discretization, and demonstrate that this corner dependence emerges naturally from the geometric structure of infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) on discrete lattices. Using a rigorous counting argument, we show that the bond dimension of an iPEPS representation exhibits a corner-dependent term that matches the predicted term in gapped continuous systems. Crucially, we find that this correspondence only emerges when averaging over all possible lattice orientations and origin positions, revealing a fundamental requirement for properly discretizing continuous systems. Our results provide a geometric understanding of entanglement corner laws and establish a direct connection between continuum field theory predictions and the structure of discrete tensor network representations. We extend our analysis to gauge-invariant systems, where lattice corners crossed by the bipartition boundary contribute an additional corner-dependent term. These findings offer new insights into the relationship between entanglement in continuous and discrete quantum systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Probing quantum critical crossover via impurity renormalization group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04729v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum impurities can host exotic many-body states that serve as sensitive probes of bath correlations. However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity. Our results demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve correlated systems with defects, opening new pathways to discovering novel impurity physics beyond those in non-interacting thermal baths.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages total (7 pages main text + 8 pages supplement), 15 figures total (5 figures main text + 10 figures supplement)</p></details> |
| **[Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07220v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</p></details> | 5 pages + appendices |

Modern exascale high-performance computing platforms offer significant potential for advancing tensor network quantum circuit simulation capabilities. We implement TN-Sim, a tensor network simulator backend within the NWQ-Sim software package that utilizes the Tensor Algebra for Many-body Methods (TAMM) framework to support both distributed HPC-scale computations and local simulations with ITensor. To optimize the scale up in computation across multiple nodes we implement a task based parallelization scheme to demonstrate parallelized gate contraction for wide quantum circuits with many gates per layer. Through the integration of the TAMM framework with Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor network approaches, we deliver a simulation environment that can scale from local systems to HPC clusters. We demonstrate an MPS tensor network simulator running on the state-of-the-art Perlmutter (NVIDIA) supercomputer and discuss the potential portability of this software to HPC clusters such as Frontier (AMD) and Aurora (Intel). We also discuss future improvements including support for different tensor network topologies and enhanced computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fourier Neural Operators for Learning Dynamics in Quantum Spin Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03302v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) excel on tasks using functional data, such as those originating from partial differential equations. Such characteristics render them an effective approach for simulating the time evolution of quantum wavefunctions, which is a computationally challenging, yet coveted task for studying quantum systems. In this manuscript, we use FNOs to model the evolution of quantum spin systems, so chosen due to their representative quantum dynamics. We explore two distinct FNO architectures, examining their performance for learning and predicting time evolution on both random and low-energy input states. We find that standard neural networks in fixed dimensions, such as U-Net, exhibit limited ability to extrapolate beyond the training time interval, whereas FNOs reliably capture the underlying time-evolution operator, generalizing effectively to unseen times. Additionally, we apply FNOs to a compact set of Hamiltonian observables ($\sim\text{poly}(n)$) instead of the entire $2^n$ quantum wavefunction, which greatly reduces the size of our FNO inputs, outputs and model dimensions. Moreover, this Hamiltonian observable-based method demonstrates that FNOs can effectively distill information from high-dimensional spaces into lower-dimensional spaces. Using this approach, we perform numerical experiments on a 20-qubit system and extrapolate Hamiltonian observables to twice the training time with a relative error of $5.8\%$. Relative to numerical time-evolution methods, FNO achieves an inference speedup of approximately $10^{4}\times$ for 20-qubit systems. The extrapolation of Hamiltonian observables to times later than those used in training is of particular interest, as this stands to fundamentally increase the simulatability of quantum systems past both the coherence times of contemporary quantum architectures and the circuit-depths of tractable tensor networks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Yet it has barriers to access from both computational complexity and computational perspectives, due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space and the complexity of modern software tools. Here we introduce{\cinzel El Agente Cuántico}, a multi-agent AI system that automates quantum-simulation workflows by translating natural-language scientific intent into executed and validated computations across heterogeneous quantum-software frameworks. By reasoning directly over library documentation and APIs, our agentic system dynamically assembles end-to-end simulations spanning state preparation, closed- and open-system dynamics, tensor-network methods, quantum control, quantum error correction, and quantum resource estimation. The developed system unifies traditionally distinct simulation paradigms behind a single natural-language interface. Beyond reducing technical barriers, this approach opens a path toward scalable, adaptive, and increasingly autonomous quantum simulation, enabling faster exploration of physical models, rapid hypothesis testing, and closer integration between theory, simulation, and emerging quantum hardware.</p></details> |  |

However, existing experimental realizations and theoretical proposals for future ones have remained restricted to one or two spatial dimensions. Here, we take a big step towards this goal by proposing a concrete experimentally feasible scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a U$(1)$ quantum link model of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in three spatial dimensions, employing \textit{linear gauge protection} to stabilize gauge invariance. Using tree tensor network simulations, we benchmark the performance of this quantum simulator through near- and far-from-equilibrium observables, showing excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory. Additionally, we introduce a method for \textit{analog quantum error mitigation} that accounts for unwanted first-order tunneling processes, vastly improving agreement between quantum-simulator and ideal-gauge-theory results. Our findings pave the way towards realistic quantum simulators of $3+1$D lattice gauge theories that can probe regimes well beyond classical simulability.</p></details> | <details><summary>$12$ ...</summary><p>$12$ pages, $6$ figures</p></details> |

Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.</p></details> | <details><summary>$9+3$...</summary><p>$9+3$ pages, $5+3$ figures</p></details> |

Closed random walks in SPC form compression pathways that spatially localize large bond-dimensions in the tensor network. Analogous to the phase separation of two immiscible liquids, SPC separates the graph of bond-dimensions into spatially distinct high and low density regions. When combined with our integral decimation algorithm, SPC facilitates the accurate compression of cyclic tensor networks with continuous degrees of freedom. To benchmark and illustrate the methods, we compute the absolute thermodynamics of $q$-state clock models on two-dimensional square lattices and an XY model on a Watts-Strogatz graph, which is a small-world network with random connectivity between spins.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Compared to other presentations, particular care has been given to disentangle aspects of tensor networks from the quantum many-body problem: MPO/MPS algorithms are presented as a way to deal with linear algebra on extremely (exponentially) large matrices and vectors, regardless of any particular application. The lectures include well-known algorithms to find eigenvectors of MPOs (the celebrated DMRG), solve linear problems, and recent learning algorithms that allow one to map a known function into an MPS (the Tensor Cross Interpolation, or TCI, algorithm). The lectures end with a discussion of how to represent functions and perform calculus with tensor networks using the "quantics" representation. They include the detailed analytical construction of important MPOs such as those for differentiation, indefinite integration, convolution, and the quantum Fourier transform. Three concrete applications are discussed in detail: the simulation of a quantum computer (either exactly or with compression), the simulation of a quantum annealer, and techniques to solve partial differential equations (e.g. Poisson, diffusion, or Gross-Pitaevskii) within the "quantics" representation.

| **[Random-Matrix-Induced Simplicity Bias in Over-parameterized Variational Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01877v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-parameterization is commonly used to increase the expressivity of variational quantum circuits (VQCs), yet deeper and more highly parameterized circuits often exhibit poor trainability and limited generalization. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Quantum Circuits for Matrix-Product Unitaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08160v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this Letter, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^α)$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $α$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^β \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $β\le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.</p></details> | Published version |
| **[Clifford Circuits Augmented Grassmann Matrix Product States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04164v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor-network (TN) methods have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can suppress substantial portions of the entanglement structure, effectively alleviating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, once the natural Grassmann-evenness requirement of the fermionic formulation is taken into account and Clifford gates with identical entanglement action are grouped together, the original set of 11520 two-qubit Clifford gates reduces to only 12 distinct gates. This strong reduction leads to a more efficient disentangling scheme within the fermionic framework. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures; v2: references and end matter added</p></details> |
| **[Biased-Noise Thresholds of Zero-Rate Holographic Codes with Tensor-Network Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06232v3)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial insight for practical quantum error correction is that different types of errors, such as single-qubit Pauli operators, typically occur with different probabilities. Finding an optimal quantum code under such biased noise is a challenging problem, related to the (generally unknown) maximum capacity of the corresponding noisy channel. A benchmark for this capacity is given by the hashing bound, which describes the performance of random stabilizer codes and leads to the matter of identifying codes that come close to the bound while also being efficiently decodable. In this work, we perform the first comprehensive analysis of asymptotically zero-rate holographic codes under biased noise. We show that many representatives from such models of this code class fulfill both the channel optimality and efficient decoding guarantees for tensor-network codes. In fact, all holographic codes tested were found to reach the hashing bound in some bias regime, while several built from the $\codepar{5,1,2}$ surface code and $\codepar{6,1,3}$ code exceed state-of-the-art code performance in the 2-Pauli noise regime. Furthermore, we consider Clifford deformations which allow all considered codes to reach the hashing bound for 1-Pauli noise as well. Our results establish that holographic codes, which were previously shown to possess efficient tensor-network decoders, also exhibit competitive thresholds under biased noise.</p></details> |  |

Finding and analyzing new QEC codes, along with efficient decoding and fault-tolerance protocols, is central to this effort. Holographic codes are a recent class of generalized concatenated codes derived from holographic bulk/boundary dualities. In addition to exploring the physics of such dualities, these codes possess useful QEC properties such as tunable encoding rates, distance scaling competitive with other well-studied code classes,and excellent recovery thresholds. To allow for a comprehensive analysis of holographic code constructions, we introduce LEGO_HQEC, a software package utilizing the quantum LEGO formalism. This package allows for the construction and analysis of holographic codes on regular hyperbolic tilings, computing their stabilizer generators and logical operators for a specified number of seed codes and layers. Three decoders are included: an erasure decoder based on Gaussian elimination; an integeroptimization decoder; and a tensor-network decoder. With these tools, LEGO_HQEC enables systematic studies of both previously known holographic codes and novel variants. As a demonstration, we provide new numerical results on the holographic blackhole pentagon code, establishing its threshold behavior under the erasure channel as a benchmark example.</p></details> |  |

For dressed Rydberg atoms in two-dimensional traps with out-of-plane dipole moments, a realistic model of the pairwise interaction is of repulsive dipolar $1/r^3$ form at long range, softened to a constant at short range. This study provides parameterizations of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo energy data for ferromagnetic (one-component) and paramagnetic (two-component) two-dimensional homogeneous Fermi fluids of interacting dipolar atoms. We find itinerant ferromagnetism to be unstable within our parameter spaces for dipolar interactions both with and without softening. Our parameterization of the energy as a function of density will enable density functional theory to support experimental studies of inhomogeneous fermionic cold atom systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Our method can be implemented with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to study two-impurity Kondo phenomena on altermagnetic metals by varying the distance and orientation between magnetic impurities. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the spin splitting of the Kondo resonance, whose spatial distribution sensitively captures the symmetry of the underlying altermagnetic order. Furthermore, the impurity spin correlations reflects the anisotropy of the RKKY interaction due to the altermagnetic Fermi surface splitting. This work provides a framework for studying the competition between the Kondo effect, the RKKY interaction and altermagnetism, in the simplest possible system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced superconducting correlations in the Emery model and its connections to strange metallic transport and normal state coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03958v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for a superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear resistivity, the three-band model crosses the resistivity of the single-band model from above, indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. The enhanced conductivity is mainly contributed by a steep increase in the diffusivity of the three-band model at the crossover, suggesting that three-band transport is more coherent than single-band transport at lower temperatures. Below the same crossover temperature in the three-band model, the pair-field susceptibility increases more steeply than at higher temperatures or when compared to the single-band model. This suggests a possible connection between superconductivity and coherent transport, and further implies that coherent transport might be necessary for a model to capture the high-temperature superconductivity observed in hole-doped cuprates.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures (main text)</p></details> |
| **[Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298v4)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_τ V_s)$, where $N_τ$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_τV_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_τ\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+5 ...</summary><p>13+5 pages, 6+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interaction-Induced Quasicrystalline Order: Emergence of Quasi-Solid and Quasi-Supersolid Phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02218v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deterministic quasiperiodicity in quantum systems has long been associated with localization, criticality, or glassy behavior, and has therefore been believed to suppress long-range order rather than stabilize it. Here we demonstrate the opposite: quasiperiodicity in interactions--without any quasiperiodic potential, disorder, or geometric modulation--can generate coherent, ordered quantum phases. We study hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic long-range interactions, V_{ij}=V_0 \cos(παi)\cos(παj), where n=α=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Using large-scale path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover thermodynamically stable incompressible plateaus at irrational densities tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus exhibit sharp incommensurate Bragg peaks, signaling an emergent quasi-solid with long-range quasicrystalline density order. More strikingly, at nearby fillings and interaction strengths, we identify a quasi-supersolid phase that supports both Fibonacci density ordering and finite superfluid density--demonstrating that interaction-induced quasiperiodicity can stabilize supersolid coherence. Our results establish a new mechanism for realizing ordered quasicrystalline quantum matter, and provide realistic guidance for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays, multimode cavity-QED systems, and trapped-ion quantum simulators.</p></details> |  |

To harness the capabilities that QC offers, we can integrate it into hybrid quantum-classical simulations, which can boost the capabilities of supercomputing by leveraging quantum modules that offer speedups over classical counterparts. One example is quantum Monte Carlo integration, which is theorised to achieve a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo, making it suitable for high-energy physics, strong-field QED, and multiple scientific and industrial applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo can be used to predict the number of pairs created when two photon beams collide head-on, a problem relevant to high-energy physics and intense laser-matter interactions. The results from the quantum simulations demonstrate high accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. The accuracy of the simulations is only constrained by the approximations required to embed polynomials and to initialise the quantum state. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be used in current quantum hardware, providing up to 90 % accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we propose pathways towards integrations with classical simulation codes.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a framework that circumvents the sign problem in the studies of quantum criticality and its associated phases by leveraging imaginary-time nonequilibrium critical dynamics. We demonstrate that the critical properties can be accurately determined from the system's short-time relaxation, a regime where the sign problem remains manageable for quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations. After validating this approach on two benchmark fermionic models, we apply it to the sign-problematic Hubbard model hosting SU(3)-symmetric Dirac fermions. We present the first numerically exact characterization of its quantum phase diagram, revealing a continuous transition between a Dirac semi-metal and a SU(3) antiferromagnetic phase. This transition defines an unconventional Gross-Neveu universality class that fundamentally reshapes current understanding of Gross-Neveu criticality. Our work provides a powerful tool for investigating sign-problematic systems and quantum criticality.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+22 ...</summary><p>6+22 pages, 3+19 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto ω^s$ via dissipation strengths $α_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $α_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $α_z = α_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s<1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 23 figures; published version</p></details> |

Building on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable~\cite{zhouIncremental2024,zhangIntegral2024,liaoExtracting2024}, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner of EE at QCPs in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction. Turning on this interaction allows us to trace an Ising critical line, reaching the tricritical point, and then a line of first-order phase transition. In (2+1)d, the tricritical point is described by the Gaussian theory, where a theoretical calculation of the corner logarithmic term in the 2nd Rényi entropy term is available~\cite{UniversalCasini2007}. Our QMC results are in quantitative agreement with this theoretical value, providing a highly nontrivial benchmark of the algorithm. Furthermore, we also study the Rényi EE at the Ising critical line and on the first-order transition line, obtaining results consistent with theoretical expectations. These findings establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+9 ...</summary><p>12+9 pages, 8+9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Coordination-driven magic numbers in protonated argon clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00591v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structural properties of rare-gas clusters can be primarily described by a simple sphere packing model or by pairwise interactions. Remarkably, adding a single proton yields a large set of magic numbers that has remained unexplained. In this Letter, we unravel their origin by combining quantum Monte Carlo techniques with many-body ab initio potentials that correctly capture the proton's coordination environment. Thanks to this approach, we find that argon atoms are mainly localized around the classical minimum, resulting in a particularly rigid behavior in stark contrast to lighter rare-gas clusters. Moreover, as cluster size increases, we identify a clear structural transition from many-body coordination-driven stability to a regime dominated by two-body interactions, reflecting a reshaping of the underlying potential energy landscape.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Universal Entanglement Growth along Imaginary Time in Quantum Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23361v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+5 p...</summary><p>7+5 pages, 4+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting the Broken Symmetry Phase of Solid Hydrogen: A Neural Network Variational Monte Carlo Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17703v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The crystal structure of high-pressure solid hydrogen remains a fundamental open problem. Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-hole spectral functions in 1D quantum magnets with different ground states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20447v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thanks to improved methods for numerical analytic continuation with constraints, spectral functions with sharp features can now be extracted from imaginary-time correlation functions computed by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,ω)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,τ)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,ω)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=π$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.</p></details> | 19 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Comparative study of plasmons in half-filled graphene via Quantum Monte Carlo and Random Phase Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20559v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures + 20 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the "roton minimum" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Although it does not suffer from the sign problem in most cases, the corresponding quantum Monte Carlo algorithm performs inefficiently, especially at a large longitudinal field. The main hindrance is the lack of loop update method which can strongly decrease the auto-correlation between Monte Carlo steps. Here, we successfully develop a loop algorithm with a novel merge-unmerge process. It demonstrates a great advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithm when implementing it to simulate the Rydberg atom chain and Kagome qubit ice.

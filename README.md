## Original Project Introduction

The project automatically fetches the latest papers from arXiv based on keywords.

The subheadings in the DailyPapers file represent the search keywords.

Only the most recent articles for each keyword are retained, up to a maximum of 100 papers.

You can click the 'Watch' button to receive daily email notifications.

## Revised

- **Changes to article information storage files**: Store updated article information in file `DailyPapers.md` instead of `README.md`. Now `README.md` will no longer be automatically updated daily.
- **Improvement of Keyword system**: Support for keyword grouping, `DailyPapers.md` and `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` will put the same group of keywords in the same table, to accommodate the existence of similar keywords.
